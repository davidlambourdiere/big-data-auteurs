This review aims to identify the role of ANNs in spinal diseases. Literature were searched from electronic databases of Scopus and Medline from 1993 to 2020 with English publications reported on the application of ANNs in spinal diseases. The search strategy was set as the combinations of the following keywords: artificial neural networks, spine, back pain, prognosis, grading, classification, prediction, segmentation, biomechanics, deep learning, and imaging. The main findings of the included studies were summarized, with an emphasis on the recent advances in spinal diseases and its application in the diagnostic and prognostic procedures. According to the search strategy, a set of 3,653 articles were retrieved from Medline and Scopus databases. After careful evaluation of the abstracts, the full texts of 89 eligible papers were further examined, of which 79 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria of this review. Our review indicates several applications of ANNs in the management of spinal diseases including (1) diagnosis and assessment of spinal disease progression in the patients with low back pain, perioperative complications, and readmission rate following spine surgery; (2) enhancement of the clinically relevant information extracted from radiographic images to predict Pfirrmann grades, Modic changes, and spinal stenosis grades on magnetic resonance images automatically; (3) prediction of outcomes in lumbar spinal stenosis, lumbar disc herniation and patient-reported outcomes in lumbar fusion surgery, and preoperative planning and intraoperative assistance; and (4) its application in the biomechanical assessment of spinal diseases. The evidence suggests that ANNs can be successfully used for optimizing the diagnosis, prognosis and outcome prediction in spinal diseases. Therefore, incorporation of ANNs into spine clinical practice may improve clinical decision making.";;;;"Montazeri, Ali/C-9276-2009; Aghaei, Hossein Nayeb/ABA-5472-2020; Sadeghi, Sohrab/ABC-2330-2020";"Montazeri, Ali/0000-0002-5198-9539; Sadeghi, Sohrab/0000-0003-3723-4321";;;;;;;;;;;;1976-1902;1976-7846;;;;AUG;2020;14;4;;;;;543;571;;10.31616/asj.2020.0147;;;;;;;WOS:000560892600016;32326672;;;;;

It was recently discovered that more information could be gathered from biosignals by applying artificial intelligence (AI). At present, one of the most impactful advancements in AI is deep learning. Deep learning-based models can extract important features from raw data without feature engineering by humans, provided the amount of data is sufficient. This AI-enabled feature presents opportunities to obtain latent information that may be used as a digital biomarker for detecting or predicting a clinical outcome or event without further invasive evaluation. However, the black box model of deep learning is difficult to understand for clinicians familiar with a conventional method of analysis of biosignals. A basic knowledge of AI and machine learning is required for the clinicians to properly interpret the extracted information and to adopt it in clinical practice. This review covers the basics of AI and machine learning, and the feasibility of their application to real-life situations by clinicians in the near future.;;;;;"choi, byungjin/0000-0002-1445-5888; Yoon, Dukyong/0000-0003-1635-8376";;;;;;;;;;;;2005-6419;2005-7563;;;;AUG;2020;73;4;;;;;275;284;;10.4097/kja.19475;;;;;;;WOS:000557537700003;31955546;;;;;
J;Chae, D;;;;Chae, Dongwoo;;;Data science and machine learning in anesthesiology;KOREAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIOLOGY;;;;;;;;;;;;Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing anesthesiology research. Unlike classical research methods that are largely inference-based, ML is geared more towards making accurate predictions. ML is a field of artificial intelligence concerned with developing algorithms and models to perform prediction tasks in the absence of explicit instructions. Most ML applications, despite being highly variable in the topics that they deal with, generally follow a common workflow. For classification tasks, a researcher typically tests various ML models and compares the predictive performance with the reference logistic regression model. The main advantage of ML lies in its ability to deal with many features with complex interactions and its specific focus on maximizing predictive performance. However, emphasis on data-driven prediction can sometimes neglect mechanistic understanding. This article mainly focuses on the application of supervised ML to electronic health record (EHR) data. The main limitation of EHR-based studies is in the difficulty of establishing causal relationships. However, the associated low cost and rich information content provide great potential to uncover hitherto unknown correlations. In this review, the basic concepts of ML are introduced along with important terms that any ML researcher should know. Practical tips regarding the choice of software and computing devices are also provided. Towards the end, several examples of successful ML applications in anesthesiology are discussed. The goal of this article is to provide a basic roadmap to novice ML researchers working in the field of anesthesiology.;;;;;, Dongwoo/0000-0002-7675-3821;;;;;;;;;;;;2005-6419;2005-7563;;;;AUG;2020;73;4;;;;;285;295;;10.4097/kja.20124;;;;;;;WOS:000557537700004;32209960;;;;;

It provides more interactions between people. Also, it fosters technology-driven Distance Education (DE). In this way, new methodologies have been developed to improve teaching and learning in DE, such as artificial intelligence methods. This paper proposes an association between artificial intelligence techniques and the concepts of Learning Styles (LS). These concepts identify the learning preferences of each student. It aims at responding the following questions: Is it possible, in an automatically way, to identify the students' LS from their interactions with the Learning Management System (LMS)? What techniques could be developed to identify the LS of the course students conducted in the DE modality, so that it will improve a better academic way to student's learning? In order to answer these questions, we used some artificial intelligence algorithms to identify the relation of the students' LS with their behaviors in LMS. Results show a low relation of the LS of the students associated with their behaviors in LMS. However, this process identified a new category of LS - it is called indefinite. It corresponds to students without preference for any of the other classifications of LS identified.;;;;;"Valentim, Ricardo/0000-0002-9216-8593; Costa, Roberto Douglas/0000-0002-6239-563X; Souza, Gustavo Fontoura de/0000-0002-9934-1256";;;;;;;;;;;;;1932-8540;;;;AUG;2020;15;3;;;;;148;160;;10.1109/RITA.2020.3008131;;;;;;;WOS:000557350000004;;;;;;

Patients and Methods: A total of 202 patients with ovarian tumors were enrolled, including 53 with ovarian cancer, 23 with borderline malignant tumors, and 126 with benign ovarian tumors. Using 5 machine learning classifiers, including support vector machine, random forest, naive Bayes, logistic regression, and XGBoost, we derived diagnostic results from 16 features, commonly available from blood tests, patient background, and imaging tests. We also analyzed the importance of 16 features on the prediction of disease. Results: The highest accuracy was 0.80 in the machine learning algorithm of XGBoost. The evaluation of importance of the features showed different results among the correlation coefficient of the features, the regression coefficient, and the features importance of random forest. Conclusion: AI could play a role in the prediction of pathological diagnosis of ovarian cancer from preoperative examinations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0250-7005;1791-7530;;;;AUG;2020;40;8;;;;;4795;4800;;10.21873/anticanres.14482;;;;;;;WOS:000554889000031;32727807;;;;;
J;Gagliardi, F;;;;Gagliardi, Francesco;;;Theories of Diagnosis: Philosophy, Cognition and History;RIVISTA DI FILOSOFIA;;;;;;;;;;;;Diagnosis is the process of attributing a disease to a patient based on the clinical signs and symptoms he or she manifests. In the philosophy of medicine, the various ways in which the diagnostic procedure can be carried out have been formalized with the theories of diagnosis. According to these theories, there are two main types of diagnosis: the causal diagnosis, which is based on the explanation of the clinical case considered, and the nosological diagnosis, which is based on the recognition of a typical morbid picture in the patient considered. In this work we consider diagnosis as a particular cognitive process of categorization and conceptualization of the human mind carried out in the clinical setting. This allows us to analyze and relate the theories of diagnosis with the theories of concepts developed in cognitive sciences - in particular with theory of theory and theory of typicality - and with the computational models introduced in Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, we show how the theories of diagnosis have their origins in the various attempts to naturalize and conceptualize the disease that arose in the history of medicine: the functionalist and the essentialist ones. This allows us to better analyze the differences and specificities of theories of diagnosis and, at the same time, to provide further support for the link between diagnosis theories and concept theories. The theories of diagnosis, theories of categorization and the different possible conceptualizations of the disease result, therefore, in a sort of circular interdependence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0035-6239;;;;;AUG;2020;111;2;;;;;239;263;;10.1413/97572;;;;;;;WOS:000550992000004;;;;;;

The use of AI appears to show significant promise in ER triage in the present. We briefly discuss the emerging effectiveness of AI in the ER imaging setting by looking at some of the products approved by the FDA and finding their way into practice. The FDA approval process to date has focused on applications that affect patient triage and not necessarily ones that have the computer serve as the only or final reader. We describe a select group of applications to provide the reader with a sense of the current state of AI use in the ER setting to assess neurologic, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal trauma indications. In the process, we highlight the benefits of triage staging using AI, such as accelerating diagnosis and optimizing workflow, with few downsides. The ability to triage patients and take care of acute processes such as intracranial bleed, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism will largely benefit the health system, improving patient care and reducing costs. These capabilities are all available now. This first wave of AI applications is not replacing radiologists. Rather, the innovative software is improving throughput, contributing to the timeliness in which radiologists can get to read abnormal scans, and possibly enhances radiologists' accuracy. As for what the future holds for the use of AI in radiology, only time will tell.;;;;;Weisberg, Edmund/0000-0002-2514-1219;;;;;;;;;;;;1070-3004;1438-1435;;;;AUG;2020;27;4;;;SI;;361;366;;10.1007/s10140-020-01773-6;;;;;;;WOS:000546714200003;32643069;;;;;

Comparison of deep neural network to first-year radiology residents for identification of pneumothorax;EMERGENCY RADIOLOGY;;;;;;;;;;;;Purpose To (1) develop a deep learning system (DLS) using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for identification of pneumothorax, (2) compare its performance to first-year radiology residents, and (3) evaluate the ability of a DLS to augment radiology residents by detecting missed pneumothoraces. Methods This was a retrospective study performed in September 2018. We obtained 112,120 chest radiographs (CXRs) from the NIH ChestXray14 database, of which 4360 cases (4%) were labeled as pneumothorax by natural language processing. We utilized 111,518 CXRs to train and validate the ResNet-152 DCNN pretrained on ImageNet to identify pneumothorax. DCNN testing was performed on a hold-out set of 602 CXRs, whose groundtruth was determined by a cardiothoracic radiologist. Two first-year radiology residents evaluated the test CXRs for presence of pneumothorax. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for each evaluator with area under the curve (AUC) compared using the DeLong parametric method. Results The DCNN achieved AUC of 0.841 for identification of pneumothorax at a rate of 1980 images/min. In contrast, both first-year residents achieved significantly higher AUCs of 0.942 and 0.905 (p < 0.01 for both compared to DCNN), but at a slower rate of two images/min. The DCNN identified 3 of 31 (9.7%) additional pneumothoraces missed by at least one of the residents. Conclusion A DLS for pneumothorax identification had lower AUC than 1st-year radiology residents, but interpreted images > 1000x as fast and identified 3 additional pneumothoraces missed by the residents. Our findings suggest that DLS could augment radiologists-in-training to identify potential urgent findings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1070-3004;1438-1435;;;;AUG;2020;27;4;;;SI;;367;375;;10.1007/s10140-020-01767-4;;;;;;;WOS:000546714200004;32643070;;;;;

Elucidating a mechanism of toxicity is, however, a costly and time-consuming process that requires the participation of specialists from a variety of fields, often relying on animal models. We present an innovative mechanistic inference framework (MechSpy), which can be used as a hypothesis generation aid to narrow the scope of mechanistic toxicology analysis. MechSpy generates hypotheses of the most likely mechanisms of toxicity, by combining a semantically-interconnected knowledge representation of human biology, toxicology and biochemistry with gene expression time series on human tissue. Using vector representations of biological entities, MechSpy seeks enrichment in a manually curated list of high-level mechanisms of toxicity, represented as biochemically- and causally-linked ontology concepts. Besides predicting the canonical mechanism of toxicity for many well-studied compounds, we experimentally validated some of our predictions for other chemicals without an established mechanism of toxicity. This mechanistic inference framework is an advantageous tool for predictive toxicology, and the first of its kind to produce a mechanistic explanation for each prediction. MechSpy can be modified to include additional mechanisms of toxicity, and is generalizable to other types of mechanisms of human biology.;;;;Tripodi, Ignacio/L-1719-2018;Tripodi, Ignacio/0000-0003-3066-4273;;;;;;;;;;;;0887-2333;;;;;AUG;2020;66;;;;;;;;104877;10.1016/j.tiv.2020.104877;;;;;;;WOS:000536124600029;32387679;;;;;

This raises the question of how to overcome the gap between symbolic and sub-symbolic artificial intelligence. We propose a semantic world modeling approach based on bottom-up object anchoring using an object-centered representation of the world. Perceptual anchoring processes continuous perceptual sensor data and maintains a correspondence to a symbolic representation. We extend the definitions of anchoring to handle multi-modal probability distributions and we couple the resulting symbol anchoring system to a probabilistic logic reasoner for performing inference. Furthermore, we use statistical relational learning to enable the anchoring framework to learn symbolic knowledge in the form of a set of probabilistic logic rules of the world from noisy and sub-symbolic sensor input. The resulting framework, which combines perceptual anchoring and statistical relational learning, is able to maintain a semantic world model of all the objects that have been perceived over time, while still exploiting the expressiveness of logical rules to reason about the state of objects which are not directly observed through sensory input data. To validate our approach we demonstrate, on the one hand, the ability of our system to perform probabilistic reasoning over multi-modal probability distributions, and on the other hand, the learning of probabilistic logical rules from anchored objects produced by perceptual observations. The learned logical rules are, subsequently, used to assess our proposed probabilistic anchoring procedure. We demonstrate our system in a setting involving object interactions where object occlusions arise and where probabilistic inference is needed to correctly anchor objects.;;;;Loutfi, Amy/R-7032-2019;Loutfi, Amy/0000-0002-3122-693X;;;;;;;;;;;;2296-9144;;;;;JUL 31;2020;7;;;;;;;;100;10.3389/frobt.2020.00100;;;;;;;WOS:000561679200001;;;;;;

The improvement in this domain has given birth to novel methods for coding with images using Artificial Intelligence techniques which can be easily integrated with real-time clinical systems. In the field of medicine, clinical findings have all time remained a problem for precise treatment especially if the patient is in the remote location. To overcome this problem, automated systems were developed. These automated systems needs transmission of medical images at variable bit rates which is one of the major limitation the hospitals are struggling with. To overcome this problem the proposed work objective is to develop a new algorithm to maintain reduced processing overhead and transmit images over variable bit rate. However images are to be processed with optimal learning rule so that the complexity in coding should be reduced and transmission is made easy. With this objective, probabilistic decision logic for image coding is proposed. Various metrics were used to compare the results obtained using the proposed approach with JPEG image compression standard. The proposed approach has improved results in comparison to other traditional coding systems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1738-7906;;;;;JUL 30;2020;20;7;;;;;61;69;;;;;;;;;WOS:000577882900009;;;;;;

However, many studies face the challenges of lacking a clear definition of emotional attachment that is overarching to cover emotional attachment to different entities and of differentiating these types of attachment phenomena. After reviewing the classic and contemporary research on human emotional attachment to people, pets, and possessions, we propose a novel, generalized definition and model of attachment across a person's lifespan that describes the mechanism of human emotional attachment. Our literature review revealed two distinct but overlapping broad categories of research on human attachment: human-human attachments and human-nonhuman attachments. Our model integrates psychological principles and mechanisms from both classic infant-mother attachment theory and contemporary consumer behaviour research on emotional attachment to nonhuman objects. Emphasis is placed on the central role ofthe self-conceptin all forms of human emotional attachments. We define human emotional attachment as a psychological phenomenon characterized by (a) perceiving the attributes of the attachment object as congruent with the self (supporting the self-concept and self-worth), (b) eliciting emotional reactions, and (c) evoking attachment behaviours. More specifically, the new model may lead to a series of new research on human emotional attachment to technologies and on its relationship to individuals' self-concept development and well-being.;;;;Huang, Lixiao/AAA-2032-2020;Huang, Lixiao/0000-0002-5543-8742;;;;;;;;;;;;1463-922X;1464-536X;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1080/1463922X.2020.1790690;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000558168300001;;;;;;

This is non-autonomous tool for computations and data operating. In fact, this tool cannot provide insight into real cognitive conditions. After Lotman and Uspensky (On the semiotics mechanism of culture, Alexandra, Tallinn, 1993), authors expand the meaning of artificial intelligence. The authors identify a cultural type of 'strong' artificial intelligence or 'self-increase ofLogos' in terms by Lotman and Uspensky (On the semiotics mechanism of culture, Alexandra, Tallinn, 1993). The interpretation of human intelligence as imitation of machine intelligence makes possible such immersion of artificial intelligence in culture. The authors reveal a case of self-organizing autonomous generation, encoding, decoding, reception, storage, and transmission of social information in the field of physical training. From the empirical studies it is clear that the organization of collective activities without external control ensures the development of positive emotions and social orientations. Interest in autonomous behavior provides the formation of educational and cognitive motives. As a special set of algorithms, these motives are the most promising and favorable for personal development.";;;;Kulikov, Sergey B./I-2683-2014;Kulikov, Sergey B./0000-0002-0913-9290;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00146-020-01026-7;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000554808000001;;;;;;

Design/methodology/approach In this study, simulation models based on linear and nonlinear approaches were used to estimate accurate energy production from minimum radiometric and meteorological data. Simulations have been carried out by using multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models with three basic types of neuron connection architectures, namely, feed-forward neural network, cascade-forward neural network (CNN) and Elman neural network. The performance is measured based on evaluation indexes, namely, mean absolute percentage error, normalized mean absolute error and normalized root mean square error. Findings A comparison of the proposed ANN models has been made with MLR models. The performance analysis indicates that all the ANN-based models are superior in prediction accuracy and stability, and among these models, the most accurate results are obtained with the use of CNN-based models. Practical implications The considered model will be adopted in solar PV forecasting areas as part of the operational forecasting chain based on numerical weather prediction. It can be an effective and powerful forecasting approach for solar power generation for large-scale PV plants. Social implications The operational forecasting system can be used to generate an effective schedule for national grid electricity system operators to ensure the sustainability as well as favourable trading performance in the electricity, such as adjusting the scheduling plan, ensuring power quality, reducing depletion of fossil fuel resources and consequently decreasing the environmental pollution. Originality/value The proposed method uses the instantaneous radiometric and meteorological data in 15-min time interval recorded over the two years of operation, which made the result exploits a fact that the energy production estimation of PV power generation station is comparatively more accurate.;;;;BOUCHOUICHA, Kada/B-1544-2018;BOUCHOUICHA, Kada/0000-0001-8112-7545;;;;;;;;;;;;1750-6220;1750-6239;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1108/IJESM-12-2019-0017;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000557055200001;;;;;;

Chest X-rays (CXRs) provide a non-invasive (potentially bedside) tool to monitor the progression of the disease. In this study, we present a severity score prediction model for COVID-19 pneumonia for frontal chest X-ray images. Such a tool can gauge the severity of COVID-19 lung infections (and pneumonia in general) that can be used for escalation or de-escalation of care as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in the ICU. Methods Images from a public COVID-19 database were scored retrospectively by three blinded experts in terms of the extent of lung involvement as well as the degree of opacity. A neural network model that was pre-trained on large (non-COVID-19) chest X-ray datasets is used to construct features for COVID-19 images which are predictive for our task. Results This study finds that training a regression model on a subset of the outputs from this pre-trained chest X-ray model predicts our geographic extent score (range 0-8) with 1.14 mean absolute error (MAE) and our lung opacity score (range 0-6) with 0.78 MAE. Conclusions These results indicate that our model's ability to gauge the severity of COVID-19 lung infections could be used for escalation or de-escalation of care as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in the ICU. To enable follow up work, we make our code, labels, and data available online.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2168-8184;;;;JUL 28;2020;12;7;;;;;;;e9448;10.7759/cureus.9448;;;;;;;WOS:000552915000016;32864270;;;;;

With AI surveillance, the American government authorities could commit massive privacy invasions against the Fourth Amendment. The fear of destructive AI privacy invasions seems eclectic. Disregarding this fear, this article maintains that the current U.S. constitutional institutions within the scope of the Fourth Amendment can still provide a practical mechanism for controlling the governments' AI privacy invasions. However, we can seldom find a substantial jurisprudential analysis on this issue. Under a pragmatic Fourth Amendment framework, this article fills out the void by analyzing certain prospects of this practical mechanism from a pragmatic perspective of analogical common law reasoning.

Kickstarter is a crowdfunding financing plataform and is a form of fundraising and is increasingly being adopted as a source for achieving the viability of projects. Despite its importance and adoption growth, the success rate of crowdfunding campaigns was 47% in 2017, and it has decreased over the years. A way of increasing the chances of success of campaigns would be to predict, by using machine learning techniques, if a campaign would be successful. By applying classification models, it is possible to estimate if whether or not a campaign will achieve success, and by applying regression models, the authors can forecast the amount of money to be funded. Design/methodology/approach The authors propose a solution in two phases, namely, launching and campaigning. As a result, models better suited for each point in time of a campaign life cycle. Findings The authors produced a static predictor capable of classifying the campaigns with an accuracy of 71%. The regression method for phase one achieved a 6.45 of root mean squared error. The dynamic classifier was able to achieve 85% of accuracy before 10% of campaign duration, the equivalent of 3 days, given a campaign with 30 days of length. At this same period time, it was able to achieve a forecasting performance of 2.5 of root mean squared error. Originality/value The authors carry out this research presenting the results with a set of real data from a crowdfunding platform. The results are discussed according to the existing literature.

An employee no longer only interacts in knowledge management (KM) in his organization but can communicate and collaborate to share knowledge through these platforms widely. Much of the spread of knowledge is a challenge for organizations to manage and use their knowledge and spread knowledge and become part of the expertise possessed by employees in their organizations. For this reason, an intelligent knowledge mapping approach is needed to facilitate finding, managing and identifying knowledge owned by an organization. This paper aims to see the use of smart knowledge mapping in organizations empirically. Design/methodology/approach This research was conducted empirically by conducting a literature study method to compile a questionnaire and conduct a survey through purposive sampling, sampling taken from the KM and Society Indonesia community. This survey limits only to respondents who have experience in conducting knowledge mapping in an organization. Findings The use of data sources that have been owned by the organization and also the consideration of the use of digital footprint employees spread across the internet can be a potential to explore the knowledge resources possessed by the organization. Of course, with the support of technology through the use of artificial intelligence (AI), it is expected to be able to present a comprehensive, adaptive and objective knowledge mapping for the organization. Practical implications The paper provides practical implications for knowledge mapping implementation in an organization by adopting AI with considerable digital footprint employees spread across the internet.

Human participants received individual automated training focusing on the relations among four 3-member stimulus classes where 2 of the 4 classes were composed of positive, algebraic, exponential expressions; 2 other classes were composed of negative exponential expressions. During the generalization test of novel stimulus relations, we assessed our 3 human participants in a series of 4 alternating contexts with 8 tests per context for a total of 32 tests of novel relations. When the DNN algorithm analyzed human training and generalization outcomes in terms of contextual control, clear resemblances between human and simulated participants became apparent. These findings are provocative in the sense that the simulated participants' performances were predictive of the contextual control exhibited by humans during tests of novel relations. The degree to which these procedures might be adapted to enhance human potential is discussed. The outcomes from this study are related to several of the theoretical issues detailed within our separate conceptual AI study within this issue (Ninness & Ninness,2020).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1064-9506;2376-6786;;;;NOV;2020;29;1;;;;;119;137;;10.1007/s42822-020-00032-0;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000552921300002;;;;;;

This review questions (a) if it is permissible for a clinician to use an opaque AI system (AIS) in clinical decision making and (b) if a patient was harmed as a result of using a clinician using an AIS's suggestion, how would responsibility and legal liability be allocated? Literature was systematically searched, retrieved, and reviewed from nine databases, which also included items from three clinical professional regulators, as well as relevant grey literature from governmental and non-governmental organisations. This literature was subjected to inclusion/exclusion criteria; those items found relevant to this review underwent data extraction. This review found that there are multiple concerns about opacity, accountability, responsibility and liability when considering the stakeholders of technologists and clinicians in the creation and use of AIS in clinical decision making. Accountability is challenged when the AIS used is opaque, and allocation of responsibility is somewhat unclear. Legal analysis would help stakeholders to understand their obligations and prepare should an undesirable scenario of patient harm eventuate when AIS were used.";;;;;Smith, Helen/0000-0002-2074-730X;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00146-020-01019-6;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000552244400001;;;;;;

Use of central controllers,uavsynchronization mechanisms or pre-planned set of actions to control a swarm in such deployments would hinder its ability to deliver expected services. We introduce artificial intelligence and game theory based flight control algorithms to be run by each autonomousuavto determine its actions in near real-time, while relying only on local spatial, temporal and electromagnetic (em) information. Eachuavusing our flight control algorithms positions itself such that the swarm maintains mobile ad-hoc network (manet) connectivity and uniform asset distribution over an area of interest. Typical tasks for swarms using our algorithms include detection, localization and tracking of mobileemtransmitters. We present a formal analysis showing that our algorithms can guide a swarm to maintain a connectedmanet, promote a uniform network spreading, while avoiding overcrowding with other swarm members. We also prove that they maintainmanetconnectivity and, at the same time, they can lead a swarm of autonomousuavs to follow or avoid anemtransmitter. Simulation experiments inopnetmodeler verify the results of formal analysis that our algorithms are capable of providing an adequate area coverage over a mobileemsource and maintainmanetconnectivity. These algorithms are good candidates for civilian and military applications that require agile responses to the changes in dynamic environments for tasks such as detection, localization and tracking mobileemtransmitters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1864-5909;1864-5917;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s12065-020-00456-y;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000552264400001;;;;;;

For this purpose, data on the constructs that captured primary appraisal (i.e., social influence, hedonic motivation and anthropomorphism), secondary appraisal (i.e., performance and effort expectancy), emotion, willingness to use AI devices and objection to use AI devices were captured from 210 guests/customers from 14 luxury hotels spread across the union territory of New Delhi and the state of Chandigarh in India. Findings that emerge from this study validate the fact that customers do indeed go through three stages of decision-making process before they demonstrate their proclivity to use AI devices or exhibit objection to use AI devices. In particular, the study found that both performance and effort expectancy influenced customer emotion which, in its turn, exercised its effect on the construct of willingness to use AI devices and objection to use AI devices among hotel customers.

J;Laukyte, M;;;;Laukyte, Migle;;;The intelligent machine: a new metaphor through which to understand both corporations and AI;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;This paper proposes to address the question of the legal status of artificial intelligence (AI) from a perspective that is unique to itself. Which means that, rather than attempting to place AI in the box of legal personhood-where many other nonhuman entities already reside, in a legal space where they are in a state of constant friction with humans-we will see whether these inhabitants can be placed in a different box: not that of legal personhood, but that of the intelligent machine. I accordingly argue that we have made a mistake in not clearly maintaining the original separation between legal persons and human persons: this is how legal persons-particularly as the concept applies to corporations-have so far been claiming and gaining the rights ascribed to humans, on the basis of their personhood. AI instead suggests the need to work outside the framework of this fiction: it suggests that we should stop using the fiction of the person for something that is not a person in the first place and in the most original and primary sense of this word. I propose a different metaphor, the metaphor of the intelligent machine, to this end drawing on the work of Dan-Cohen (2016), who advanced this metaphor to argue that it fits corporations better than the metaphor of the person. In conclusion, we should be able to see that this metaphor of the intelligent machine makes a better fit not only for corporations but also for AI and robotics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00146-020-01018-7;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000551705800001;;;;;;

Moreover, China's Belt and Road Initiative, which unites Eurasia and Africa and loops in South America into a seamless space of trade, infrastructure and digital connectivity, challenges the dominance of traditional industrial powers (the United States, the European Union and Japan) and requires critical minerals. Rare earths, lithium and cobalt - among the most critical of the CRMs - are found in high geographic concentration, creating hotspots of contention, especially in unstable parts of the world. As economic transformations accelerate, securing access to these materials will both impact and help shape geopolitics in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0393-2729;1751-9721;;;;JUL 2;2020;55;3;;;;;1;16;;10.1080/03932729.2020.1786926;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000555079100001;;;;;;

They may also drag a replacement of human conscience in large chunks of life. AI systems can be designed to leave moral control in human hands, to obstruct or diminish that moral control, or even to prevent it, replacing human morality with pre-packaged or developed 'solutions' by the 'intelligent' machine itself. Artificial Intelligent systems (AIS) are increasingly being used in multiple applications and receiving more attention from the public and private organisations. The purpose of this article is to offer a mapping of the technological architectures that support AIS, under the specific focus of the moral agency. Through a literature research and reflection process, the following areas are covered: a brief introduction and review of the literature on the topic of moral agency; an analysis using the BDI logic model (Bratman1987); an elemental review of artificial 'reasoning' architectures in AIS; the influence of the data input and the data quality; AI systems' positioning in decision support and decision making scenarios; and finally, some conclusions are offered about regarding the potential loss of moral control by humans due to AIS. This article contributes to the field of Ethics and Artificial Intelligence by providing a discussion for developers and researchers to understand how and under what circumstances the 'human subject' may, totally or partially, lose moral control and ownership over AI technologies. The topic is relevant because AIS often are not single machines but complex networks of machines that feed information and decisions into each other and to human operators. The detailed traceability of input-process-output at each node of the network is essential for it to remain within the field of moral agency. Moral agency is then at the basis of our system of legal responsibility, and social approval is unlikely to be obtained for entrusting important functions to complex systems under which no moral agency can be identified.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00146-020-01020-z;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000551355200001;;;;;;

However, including computational thinking into science instruction may be challenging. Therefore, for biological evolution (an essential theory within biology that spans across temporal and organizational scales), we recommend integrating computational thinking into evolution teaching to overcome misconceptions, reinforce the nature of science (NOS), and allow student embodiment (as students become emerged in their models, i.e., personification). We present a learning progression, which outlines biological evolution learning coupled with computational thinking. The defined components of computational thinking (input, integration, output, and feedback) are integrated with biology student roles. The complex nature of both teaching computational thinking and biological evolution lends toward a learning progression that identifies instructional context, computational product, and computational process and spans from simple to complex. Two major themes of biological evolution, unity and diversity have each been paired with both computational thinking and specific corresponding NGSS standards at levels of increasing complexity. There are virtually no previous studies which relate computation and evolution across scales, which paves the way for questions of importance, support, benefits, and overall student achievement in relation to the advancement of science in education.;;;;;Christensen, Dana/0000-0002-2448-3794;;;;;;;;;;;;0926-7220;1573-1901;;;;AUG;2020;29;4;;;SI;;1035;1077;;10.1007/s11191-020-00141-7;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000551354600002;;;;;;

At the same time, the cost and time impact on international supply chains through the port must be kept to a strict minimum, in order to safeguard the competitive position of ports. This paper studies and identifies well-suited state-of-the-art/new technological solutions that should make it possible to screen the maximum possible number of containers (primarily in relation to imports) the most time-effectively. A two-dimensional methodology was applied within the project. First, several interviews were held with associations of shipping companies, forwarders, shippers, terminal operators and customs authorities, in order to combine knowledge gained from the technological assessment with experience from the professional field. Results from the interviews were used to map the current scanning process, as well as the potential for changes to that process. Second, the following tools, solutions and techniques were used as part of the feasibility study and a supply chain impact analysis study: X-ray technology and electromechanical techniques, both supported and not by AI. The results obtained indicate that increasing the scanning rate will increase the cost of scanning for terminals. These costs will be significantly higher than they currently are, particularly for large container terminals. Furthermore, congestion at the terminal and delays in the operational process are essential issues that must be addressed.

Mapping such data into enterprise master data for reporting and prediction is an effort-intensive, time-consuming process which is prone to errors. Machines cannot match these sources and map to master data accurately. Enterprises are eager to automate the human intensive tasks of data harmonization so that their resources can focus on finding the insights to drive the business. We undertook one such automation initiative for a global Market Research Major (MRM) and achieved a significant level of success leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The Automated Data Harmonization (ADH) solution has been a multi-step approach of Dictionary Matching, Fuzzy Text Similarity, and different Machine Learning techniques. It has been implemented on the Big Data stack for better performance and scalability. In order to streamline the overall business process, runtime rules and workflow has been implemented. The Proof of Concept has yielded an overall F-Score within the range of 82-93% depending on the variation of the dataset.

Such systems are known to generate and store large volumes of data that can be exploited to assess the learner, the system and the quality of the interaction between them. Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics (LA) are two distinct and yet closely related research areas that focus on this data aiming to address open education-related questions or issues. Besides 'classic' data analysis methods such as clustering, classification, identification or regression/analysis of variances,soft computingmethods are often employed by EDM and LA researchers to achieve their various tasks. Their very nature as iterative optimization algorithms that avoid the exhaustive search of the solutions space and go for possibly suboptimal solutions yet at realistic time and effort, along with their heavy reliance on rich data sets for training, make soft computing methods ideal tools for the EDM or LA type of problems. Decision trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, support vector machines and genetic/evolutionary algorithms are a few examples of soft computing approaches that, given enough data, can successfully deal with uncertainty, qualitatively stated problems and incomplete, imprecise or even contradictory data sets - features that the field of education shares with all humanities/social sciences fields. The present review focuses, therefore, on recent EDM and LA research that employs at least one soft computing method, and aims to identify (i) the majoreducation problems/issuesaddressed and, consequently,research goals/objectivesset, (ii) thelearning contexts/settingswithin which relevant research and educational interventions take place, (iii) the relation betweenclassic and soft computing methodsemployed to solve specific problems/issues, and (iv) the means of dissemination (publication journals)of the relevant research results. Selection and analysis of a body of 300 journal publications reveals that top research questions in education today seeking answers through soft computing methods refer directly to the issue ofquality- a critical issue given the currently dominant educational/pedagogical models that favor e-learning or computer- or technology-mediated learning contexts. Moreover, results identify the most frequently used methods and tools within EDM/LA research and, comparatively, within their soft computing subsets, along with the major journals relevant research is being published worldwide. Weaknesses and issues that need further attention in order to fully exploit the benefits of research results to improve both the learning experience and the learning outcomes are discussed in the conclusions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1560-4292;1560-4306;;;;OCT;2020;30;3;;;;;371;430;;10.1007/s40593-020-00200-8;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000550602600002;;;;;;
J;Kirchengast, T;;;;Kirchengast, Tyrone;;;Deepfakes and image manipulation: criminalisation and control;INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY LAW;;;;;;;;;;;;Deepfakes are a form of human image synthesis where an existing picture or image is superimposed into a video to change the identity of those depicted in the video. The technology relies on machine learning or artificial intelligence to map an existing image, usually a photo of a person's face, to transfer that image to an existing video image. The technology emerged into the latter part of 2017, and has since given rise to apps and other programmes that allow users to create their own deepfakes. We already use filters and emojis to alter images by consent, however, deepfakes are particularly problematic because they allow for production of videos that are highly convincing, taken to be a real video of the person depicted. Deepfakes provide for the manipulation of all manner of video, but particular risks include videos produced to incite political deception, voter manipulation, commercial fraud, and 'revenge porn'. The production of deepfake 'revenge porn' presents as especially insidious given the ability to transfer the face of any person onto an already existing pornographic video. Harm is exacerbated where that video is then disseminated, via the internet or by social media.;;;;;Kirchengast, Tyrone/0000-0001-7517-3537;;;;;;;;;;;;1360-0834;1469-8404;;;;SEP 1;2020;29;3;;;;;308;323;;10.1080/13600834.2020.1794615;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000552110100001;;;;;;

The proposed approach for this management system handles the various factors that affect the health of people with diabetes by combining multiple artificial intelligence algorithms. The proposed framework factors the diabetes management problem into subgoals: building a Tensorflow neural network model for food classification; thus, it allows users to upload an image to determine if a meal is recommended for consumption; implementing K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm to recommend meals; using cognitive sciences to build a diabetes question and answer chatbot; tracking user activity, user geolocation, and generating pdfs of logged blood sugar readings. The food recognition model was evaluated with cross-entropy metrics that support validation using Neural networks with a backpropagation algorithm. The model learned features of the images fed from local Ghanaian dishes with specific nutritional value and essence in managing diabetics and provided accurate image classification with given labels and corresponding accuracy. The model achieved specified goals by predicting with high accuracy, labels of new images. The food recognition and classification model achieved over 95% accuracy levels for specific calorie intakes. The performance of the meal recommender model and question and answer chatbot was tested with a designed cross-platform user-friendly interface using Cordova and Ionic Frameworks for software development for both mobile and web applications. The system recommended meals to meet the calorific needs of users successfully using KNN (withk=5) and answered questions asked in a human-like way. The implemented system would solve the problem of managing activity, dieting recommendations, and medication notification of diabetics.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1687-6415;1687-6423;;;;JUL 16;2020;2020;;;;;;;;8870141;10.1155/2020/8870141;;;;;;;WOS:000556342000001;32724304;;;;;

Design/methodology/approach This study was conducted for the identification of factors responsible for the adoption of the AI-integrated CRM system in Indian organizations focusing attention on security and privacy perspective. For this, the adoption theories and models have been studied. The literature available in this context has also been studied with a focus on security and privacy issues. After the initial study, few hypotheses have been formulated and a conceptual model has been developed. These hypotheses were validated with the help of statistical tools by conducting sample survey with 324 usable responses against 36 questionnaires. Findings The results of this study highlight that of the eight hypotheses conceptually formulated, one hypothesis was not supported as is evident from the application of statistical analysis. This is the influence of perceived ease of use on attitude of the stakeholders intending to use the AI-integrated CRM system in Indian organizations. The results also transpire that the model so provided has achieved 87% explanative power. Research limitations/implications The model so provided has taken the help of the technological acceptance model. It has also used the issues circumscribing menace of security and privacy vulnerabilities. Consideration of the technological acceptance model and aspects of issues of security and privacy has enriched the model rendering its explanative power to 87%. Practical implications The model is simple. Practitioners can execute this model without having any complexity. The policymakers could also get inputs from the model, as it has focused specially on security and privacy issues that could help to enhance the trust of the potential users. Originality/value Not many studies are found covering the adoption of the AI-integrated CRM system by Indian organizations with a special focus on security and privacy aspects. In this light, this study is a novel attempt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2056-4961;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1108/ICS-02-2019-0029;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000552136800001;;;;;;

The impact of Industry 4.0 technology adoption on sustainable manufacturing and circular economy has been under-researched. This paper aims to review the latest articles in the area of Industry 4.0, sustainable manufacturing and circular economy and further developed a research framework showing key paths. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative research is performed in two stages. In the first stage, a review of the extant literature is performed to identify the barriers, drivers, challenges and opportunities. In the second stage, a research framework is proposed to integrate Industry 4.0 technology (big data analytics powered artificial intelligence) adoption, sustainable manufacturing and circular economy capabilities. Findings This research extends the knowledge base by providing a detailed review of Industry 4.0, sustainable manufacturing, and circular economy and proposes a research framework by integrating these three contemporary concepts in the context of supply chain management. Through an exploration of this integrative research framework, the authors propose a future research agenda and seven research propositions. Research limitations/implications It is important to understand the interplay between institutional pressures, tangible resources and human skills for Industry 4.0 technology (big data analytics powered artificial intelligence) adoption. Industry 4.0 technology (big data analytics powered artificial intelligence) adoption can positively influence sustainable manufacturing and circular economy capabilities. Managers must also put more attention to sustainable manufacturing to develop circular economic capabilities. Social implications Factory workers and the local communities generally suffer from various adverse effects resulting from the traditional manufacturing process. The quality of the environment is deteriorating to such an extent that people even staying miles away from the factory are also affected due to environmental pollution that is generated from factory operations. Hence, sustainable manufacturing is the only choice left to manufacturers that can help in the transition to a circular economy. The research framework can help firms to enhance circular economy capabilities. Originality/value This review paper contains the most updated work on Industry 4.0, sustainable manufacturing and circular economy. It also proposes a research framework to integrate these three concepts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1934-8835;1758-8561;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1108/IJOA-04-2020-2120;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000552141500001;;;;;;

Referring to fuzzy logic based decision-making; the best option was selected from multiple fuzzy variables through performing a comparison and by obtaining the fastest solution for approximation. The expert system offers a capable fuzzy application for engineering judgment to be utilised in geotechnical decision making for engineering design. Kinematic analysis is currently used for the stability assessment of all types of toppling failures which provides the 'occurrence possibility' and is not capable of describing the stability conditions (degree of occurrences) in discontinuous rock slopes.

There have been various applications of this technology to surgical fields. AI and ML have been used to evaluate a surgeon's technical skill. These technologies can detect instrument motion, recognize patterns in video recordings, and track the physical motion, eye movements, and cognitive function of the surgeon. These modalities also aid in the advancement of robotic surgical training. The da Vinci Standard Surgical System developed a recording and playback system to help trainees receive tactical feedback to acquire more precision when operating. ML has shown promise in recognizing and classifying complex patterns on diagnostic images and within pathologic tissue analysis. This allows for more accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment. Artificial neural networks are able to analyze sets of symptoms in conjunction with labs, imaging, and exam findings to determine the likelihood of a diagnosis or outcome. Telemedicine is another use of ML and AI that uses technology such as voice recognition to deliver health care remotely. Limitations include the need for large data sets to program computers to create the algorithms. There is also the potential for misclassification of data points that do not follow the typical patterns learned by the machine. As more applications of AI and ML are developed for the surgical field, further studies are needed to determine feasibility, efficacy, and cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0975-7651;0976-6952;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s13193-020-01166-8;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000548813800001;33299275;;;;;

We suggest to describe time-varying systems by considering the evolution of their geometrical and topological properties in time, by using a method based on persistent homology. In the static case, persistent homology allows one to provide a representation of a manifold paired with a continuous function as a collection of multisets of points and lines called persistence diagrams. The idea is to fingerprint the change of a variable-geometry space as a time series of persistence diagrams, and afterwards compare such time series by using dynamic time warping. As an application, we express some music features and their time dependency by updating the values of a function defined on a polyhedral surface, called theTonnetz. Thereafter, we use this time-based representation to automatically classify three collections of compositions according to their style, and discuss the optimal time-granularity for the analysis of different musical genres.;;;;;bergomi, mattia giuseppe/0000-0002-3732-3108;;;;;;;;;;;;1745-9737;1745-9745;;;;MAY 3;2020;14;2;;;SI;;204;221;;10.1080/17459737.2020.1786745;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000552861300001;;;;;;

The subject aims at increasing the efficiency of existing processes and the institutional side of the industry is really interested. And in some ways, this is a breakthrough. This article elaborates on the current status quo and future path of the industry. Design/methodology/approach- The real estate industry is evolving, and parts of the business are increasingly being conquered by proptechs and fintechs. They have come into real estate to stay not because they discovered inefficiencies in the way one manages and does business with real estate, but because they come with an arsenal of new technologies that can change the whole game. The article discusses a path for changing the game in real estate. Findings - location, location, location has now evolved to data, data, data. However, there is one essential aspect that must be considered before the latter can become the real value creator: the ability of market players to analyse data. And this does not mean being an excellent Excel user.

Body dysmorphic disorder is a DSM-5 psychiatric disorder defined as a preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others. Snapchat dysmorphia is fueled by automated selfie filters that reflect unrealistic sociocultural standard. In this paper, we discuss how body dysmorphic disorder and related body image distortions could arise, using the conceptual resources provided by the active inference framework. We suggest that these disorders involve dysfunctional self-modelling which entails maladaptive internalization of sociocultural preferences during adolescent identity formation. Identity formation is hereby described as cycles of interpersonal active inference that arbitrate between identity exploration and commitment. We propose that impaired self-modelling is unable to reduce interpersonal uncertainty during identity exploration, which, over time, degenerates into uncontrollable epistemic habits that isolate the body image from corrective sensory evidence. In light of these insights, we subsequently explore some of the consequences of image-centered social media platforms on the identity formation process. We conclude that heightened interpersonal uncertainty in this novel context could precipitate the onset of body dysmorphic disorder and related body image distortions, particularly when selfie filters are involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00146-020-01015-w;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000547785500001;;;;;;

Some researchers have argued that AI will augment the capacities of physicians and increase their availability to provide empathy and other uniquely human forms of care to their patients. The human vulnerabilities experienced in the healthcare context raise the stakes of new technologies such as AI, and the human dimensions of AI in healthcare have particular significance for research in the humanities. This article explains four key areas of concern relating to AI and the role that medical/health humanities research can play in addressing them: definition and regulation of medical versus health data and apps; social determinants of health; narrative medicine; and technological mediation of care. Issues include data privacy and trust, flawed datasets and algorithmic bias, racial discrimination, and the rhetoric of humanism and disability. Through a discussion of potential humanities contributions to these emerging intersections with AI, this article will suggest future scholarly directions for the field.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1041-3545;1573-3645;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s10912-020-09636-4;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000547351600001;32654043;;;;;

To help address this issue, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) based automatic scheduling method that creates a thermal profile of CDC nodes using an integrated Internet of Things (IoT) and Fog computing environment callediThermoFog. We use a Gaussian Mixture Model to approximate the thermal characteristics of the servers which are used to predict and schedule tasks to minimize the average CDC temperature. Through empirical evaluation on an iFogSim and ThermoSim based testbed and IoT based smart home application, we show that iThermoFog outperforms the current state-of-the-art thermal-aware scheduling method. Specifically, iThermoFog reduces mean square temperatures by 13.5%, while simultaneously improving energy consumption, execution time, scheduling time and bandwidth usage.;;;;"Tuli, Shreshth/AAK-1236-2020; Gill, Sukhpal Singh/J-5930-2014";"Tuli, Shreshth/0000-0003-2960-1128; Gill, Sukhpal Singh/0000-0002-3913-0369";;;;;;;;;;;;;2476-1508;;;;SEP;2020;3;5;;;;;;;e198;10.1002/itl2.198;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000547909000001;;;;;;
J;Dahlbeck, MD;;;;Dahlbeck, Moa De Lucia;;;AI and Spinoza: a review of law's conceptual treatment of Lethal Autonomous;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;In this article I will argue that the philosophy of Benedict Spinoza (1632-1677) may assist us in coming to terms with some of the conceptual challenges that the phenomenon of Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses on law and legal thought. I will pursue this argument in three steps. First, I will suggest that Spinoza's philosophy of the mind and knowledge may function as an analytical tool for making sense of the prevailing conception of AI within the legal discourse on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS). Then, I will continue the argument with the aid of Spinoza's political philosophy which partly complicates the picture as it seems to disqualify a normative process grounded directly upon the means stipulated for achieving a robust understanding of AI. Based on these two separate discussions I will conclude by outlining a composite critique - from the twofolded perspective of Spinoza's ethical and political discussions - of the ongoing negotiations of a new Conventional Weapons Convention (CCW) protocol on LAWS.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00146-020-01014-x;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000547203100001;;;;;;

In this comprehensive review, we have sought to accumulate the factors that determine outcomes of AF. Recent Findings Patient factors such as age, sex, and ethnicity have a vital impact on the incidence and progression of AF, including outcomes of catheter ablation. While the above are non-modifiable, we also provide detailed associations of potentially modifiable comorbidities such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, conduction system disorders, and substance abuse with AF. Beyond patient factors, some parameters related to the AF itself can determine outcomes-such as duration of AF, whether it is paroxysmal or persistent AF and certain critical electrocardiographic patterns that suggest a higher risk of AF recurrence. Imaging modalities such as echocardiography, computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance provide invaluable insights into the progression of AF. We describe the various pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies for AF management with a peek at some futuristic approaches. While each one of these variables could lend themselves for a separate review, we attempted to provide an overview of the most critical predictors of AF outcomes to equip the readers with the latest know-how of the management of AF.;;;;Kowlgi, Gurukripa N./ABD-1703-2020;Kowlgi, Gurukripa N./0000-0002-0913-3497;;;;;;;;;;;;1932-9520;1932-9563;;;;JUL 9;2020;14;9;;;;;;;11;10.1007/s12170-020-00645-5;;;;;;;WOS:000546703100001;;;;;;

So far, few examples from the huge pool of natural models have been examined and transferred to technical applications. Like living organisms, subsequent generations of soft machines will autonomously respond, sense, and adapt to the environment. Plants as concept generators remain relatively unexplored in biomimetic approaches to robotics and related technologies, despite being able to grow, and continuously adapt in response to environmental stimuli. In this research review, we highlight recent developments in plant-inspired soft machine systems based on movement principles. We focus on inspirations taken from fast active movements in the carnivorous Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) and compare current developments in artificial Venus flytraps with their biological role model. The advantages and disadvantages of current systems are also analyzed and discussed, and a new state-of-the-art autonomous system is derived. Incorporation of the basic structural and functional principles of the Venus flytrap into novel autonomous applications in the field of robotics not only will inspire further plant-inspired biomimetic developments but might also advance contemporary plant-inspired robots, leading to fully autonomous systems utilizing bioinspired working concepts.;;;;Tauber, Falk/AAY-2148-2020;Tauber, Falk/0000-0001-7225-1472;;;;;;;;;;;;2296-9144;;;;;JUL 8;2020;7;;;;;;;;75;10.3389/frobt.2020.00075;;;;;;;WOS:000554481400001;;;;;;

Conventionally, for these applications, manufacturer's power curves are used in estimating the velocity-power characteristics of the turbines. However, performance of the turbines under actual field environments may significantly differ from the manufacturer's power curves, which are derived under 'standard' conditions. In case of existing wind projects with sufficient performance data, the velocity-power variations can better be defined using artificially intelligent models. In this paper, we compare the performance of four such models by applying them to a 2-MW onshore wind turbine. Models based on ANN, KNN, SVM and MARS were developed and tested using the SCADA data collected from the turbine. All the AI models performed significantly better than the manufacturer's power curve. Among the AI methods, SVM-based predictions showed the highest accuracy. A site-specific performance curve for the turbine, based on the SVM model, is presented. Wider adaptability of this approach has been demonstrated by successfully implementing the model for a 3.6-MW wind turbine, working under offshore environment. Being site-specific data driven, the proposed models are more accurate and hence better choice for applications like short-term wind power forecasting and pro-diagnostics of wind turbines.;;;;;Mathew, sathyajith/0000-0001-9383-8790;;;;;;;;;;;;2008-9163;2251-6832;;;;SEP;2020;11;3;;;;;289;297;;10.1007/s40095-020-00352-2;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000546217700001;;;;;;

Significant improvements could be obtained by deep learning. Yet, captions generated by humans are still considered better, which makes it an interesting application for interactive machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence methods. In this work, we aim at improving the performance and explainability of the state-of-the-art method Show, Attend and Tell by augmenting their attention mechanism using additional bottom-up features. We compute visual attention on the joint embedding space formed by the union of high-level features and the low-level features obtained from the object specific salient regions of the input image. We embed the content of bounding boxes from a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model. This delivers state-of-the-art performance, while it provides explanatory features. Further, we discuss how interactive model improvement can be realized through re-ranking caption candidates using beam search decoders and explanatory features. We show that interactive re-ranking of beam search candidates has the potential to outperform the state-of-the-art in image captioning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0933-1875;1610-1987;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s13218-020-00679-2;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000546586500001;;;;;;

For training of the network, a distant supervision approach utilizing 17,822 labeled investment ideas from the crowd-sourced investment advisory platform Seeking Alpha is applied. Findings According to the results of autoregressive distributed lag models including contemporary and lagged sentiment as independent variables, the derived textual sentiment indicator is not only significantly linked to the depth and resilience dimensions of market liquidity (proxied by Amihud's (2002) price impact measure), but also to the breadth dimension (proxied by transaction volume).

However, the advancement in technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques has paved the way for better and accurate prediction of stock-price in recent years. Of late, Support Vector Machines (SVM) have earned popularity among Machine Learning (ML) algorithms used for predicting stock price. However, a high percentage of studies in algorithmic investments based on SVM overlooked the overfitting nature of SVM when the input dataset is of high-noise and high-dimension. Therefore, this study proposes a novel homogeneous ensemble classifier called GASVM based on support vector machine enhanced with Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature-selection and SVM kernel parameter optimisation for predicting the stock market. The GA was introduced in this study to achieve a simultaneous optimal of the diverse design factors of the SVM. Experiments carried out with over eleven (11) years' stock data from the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) yielded compelling results. The outcome shows that the proposed model (named GASVM) outperformed other classical ML algorithms (Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Neural Network (NN)) in predicting a 10-day-ahead stock price movement. The proposed (GASVM) showed a better prediction accuracy of 93.7% compared with 82.3% (RF), 75.3% (DT), and 80.1% (NN). It can, therefore, be deduced from the fallouts that the proposed (GASVM) technique puts-up a practical approach feature-selection and parameter optimisation of the different design features of the SVM and thus remove the need for the labour-intensive parameter optimisation.;;;;NTI, ISAAC KOFI/E-2004-2017;NTI, ISAAC KOFI/0000-0001-9257-4295;;;;;;;;;;;;2299-1093;;;;;JUL 4;2020;10;1;;;;;153;163;;10.1515/comp-2020-0199;;;;;;;WOS:000547482000001;;;;;;

One of the methods for pressure management is using pressure-reducing valves (PRV). This paper outlines an optimization-simulation approach to determine the optimum location and settings of the PRVs to control the pressure and minimize the leakage in WDSs. To solve the problem, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) tool was coupled with EPANET hydraulic simulation software in MATLAB environment. The results revealed that by observing all the regulations of the problem, through utilizing the proposed method for finding optimal location and regulating the PRVs, the network average leakage rate in a 24-h utilization period dropped by 23%. The performance of the PSO-based model in pressure management was compared with models based on three specific types of powerful algorithms including a genetic algorithm (GA) from the evolutionary algorithms (EA), artificial bee colony (ABC) from the swarm intelligence, and cultural algorithm (CA) from human behavior. The PSO-based model with the lowest objective function call compared to the other three algorithms, was able to reduce leakage compared to GA, ABC, and CA by 1.63, 3.45, and 8.53%, respectively. That shows the presented method is successful in regulating the pressure level to minimize network leakage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2363-5037;2363-5045;;;;JUL 4;2020;6;4;;;;;;;64;10.1007/s40899-020-00426-3;;;;;;;WOS:000545209100001;;;;;;
J;van Tuinen, S;;;;van Tuinen, Sjoerd;;;PHILOSOPHY IN THE LIGHT OF AI hegel or leibniz;ANGELAKI-JOURNAL OF THE THEORETICAL HUMANITIES;;;;;;;;;;;;Philosophy already has a long history of coming to terms with artificial intelligence (AI). But if the future of the concept is indeed inseparable from artificial languages and ubiquitous computing, then philosophy must also be able to understand and rewrite its own history in this unnatural light. To this end, I distinguish two manners in which modern philosophy has pursued the artificial cultivation of intelligence. The first is Hegelian. Recently, Yuk Hui and Reza Negarestani have pointed to the affinity between the Hegelian notion of absolute spirit and the functioning of intelligence found in cybernetics and systems theory, as well as in cognitive science. As technology has become our destiny, this leads them to the problem of the continued relevance of humanstothe history of a general self-authorizing intelligence. By contrast, I propose to bluntly identify intelligence itself with a rather different sense for relevance, that is, for singularity. Philosophically speaking, this identification reaches back to the proto-structuralist system of Leibniz, which aims for universal communication. Leibniz's many inventions of formal languages, from the binary system and the universal characteristic to magic and mechanical calculating devices, constitute a proto-AI that functions as the operative code of an inclusive civility. My thesis is the following: if Hegel offered the first grand narrative of the recursive self-critique of common-sense immediacy in the form of artificial good sense, Leibnizian cosmotechnics instead bet on a proto-cybernetic reason that contributes to the distributive composition of an unnatural common sense, all the while protecting multiplicity against its collectivization by a self-naturalizing good sense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0969-725X;1469-2899;;;;JUL 3;2020;25;4;;;SI;;97;109;;10.1080/0969725X.2020.1790838;;;;;;;WOS:000556045200009;;;;;;

D.";;;Large-scale economic load dispatch using squirrel search algorithm;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT;;;;;;;;;;;;Purpose Economic load dispatch (ELD) is one of the crucial optimization problems in power system planning and operation. The ELD problem with valve point loading (VPL) and multi-fuel options (MFO) is defined as a non-smooth and non-convex optimization problem with equality and inequality constraints, which obliges an efficient heuristic strategy to be addressed. The purpose of this study is to present a new and powerful heuristic optimization technique (HOT) named as squirrel search algorithm (SSA) to solve non-convex ELD problems of large-scale power plants. Design/methodology/approach The suggested SSA approach is aimed to minimize the total fuel cost consumption of power plant considering their generation values as decision variables while satisfying the problem constraints. It confers a solution to the ELD issue by anchoring with foraging behavior of squirrels based on the dynamic jumping and gliding strategies. Furthermore, a heuristic approach and selection rules are used in SSA to handle the constraints appropriately. Findings Empirical results authenticate the superior performance of SSA technique by validating on four different large-scale systems. Comparing SSA with other HOTs, numerical results depict its proficiencies with high-qualitative solution and by its excellent computational efficiency to solve the ELD problems with non-smooth fuel cost function addressing the VPL and MFO. Moreover, the non-parametric tests prove the robustness and efficacy of the suggested SSA and demonstrate that it can be used as a competent optimizer for solving the real-world large-scale non-convex ELD problems. Practical implications This study has compared various HOTs to determine optimal generation scheduling for large-scale ELD problems. Consequently, its comparative analysis will be beneficial to power engineers for accurate generation planning. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this manuscript is the first research work of using SSA approach for solving ELD problems.

Placing too much trust in, or misusing, machines that make decisions is risky, and the legalities are complex in terms of liability and responsibility. Autonomous systems can be grouped into three broad categories: technical systems that make decisions in no win hazardous situations (vehicles in traffic, collaborating robots); decision support systems in governance applications (administration, government, court, staff acquisition, etc.), which may lead to unfair decisions for humans and society; and systems that are open to deliberate misuse by providing information that can't be proven to be true or fake, potentially influencing elections, public opinion or legal processes to an extent unknown before. These risks cannot be easily countered by conventional methods.

These systems are used in areas such as retail, finances, and manufacturing. In the latter domain, the main priority is that the solutions are interpretable, as this characteristic correlates to the adoption rate of users (e.g., schedulers). However, more recently, these systems have been applied in areas of public interest, such as education, health, public administration, and criminal justice. The adoption of these systems in this domain, in particular the data-driven decision models, has raised questions about the risks associated with this technology, from which ethical problems may emerge.

This article examines the potential of autonomous drones, their implications and how deception could possibly be a defence against them and /or a means of gaining advantage. It posits that officially, no truly autonomous drone is operational now, yet the development of AI and other technologies could expand the capabilities of these devices, which will inevitably confront society with a number of deep ethical, legal, and philosophical issues. The article also examines the impact of autonomous drones and their targets in terms of the power/deception nexus. The impact of surveillance and kinetic impacts on the target populations is investigated. The use of swarms can make deception more difficult although security can be breached. The Internet of Things can be considered as based on the same model as a swarm and its impact on human behaviour indicates that deception or perhaps counter-deception should be considered as a defence. Finally, the issues raised are outlined. However, this article does not provide definitive answers but, hopefully, exposes a number of issues that will stimulate further discussion and research in this general area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1947-3435;1947-3443;;;;JUL-SEP;2020;10;3;;;;;1;14;;10.4018/IJCWT.2020070101;;;;;;;WOS:000574605400002;;;;;;

The authors of the article have considered the issues of legal identity, algorithmic transparency and accountability, the atmosphere of trust, moral choice and emotional connection between a person and a machine since they are interdependent and somehow affect all types of autonomous technical means. This article proves that autonomous technical means resulted from the Fourth Industrial Revolution are qualitatively different from traditional objects of law (material and non-material). While preparing the article, the authors used methods of collecting and studying isolated facts, generalization, scientific abstraction, legal methods and methods of objectivity, specificity and pluralism. They have concluded that the existing approaches to the legal regulation of autonomous technical means depend on the type of technology, type of technological products or their field of application. The article proposes an alternative approach that develops new legal regulation based on cross-cutting legal issues arising from the fact that modern technical means become autonomous. This approach enables to put forward and substantiate the following thesis: to establish stable and balanced regulation, it is advisable to develop a legal regime that provides for specific control over legal relations and a special set of legal means.;;;;Kuteynikov, Dmitry/AAA-1018-2019;Kuteynikov, Dmitry/0000-0003-1448-3085;;;;;;;;;;;;0719-4706;;;;;JUL-SEP;2020;7;;;;SI;;346;356;;;;;;;;;WOS:000572957200029;;;;;;

The purpose of studying the possibilities of implementing artificial intelligence in the legal proceedings of contemporary Russia and the prospects for its application in this area is directly related to the need to develop and improve the regulatory framework. The analysis of modern scientific views on the possibility of using artificial intelligence in Russian court proceedings shows that there are opposed opinions concerning the forms and prospects of such use - from solving purely technical problems as an intelligent electronic assistant to the judge to replacing completely the judge in the administration of justice. According to the authors, at the present development stage of the Russian state, it is too early to talk about replacing the judge with artificial intelligence, while in the context of individual situations, it is impossible. The article compares examples of using the capabilities of artificial intelligence in the judicial activity of foreign countries and analyzes the main provisions of international acts that enshrine the ethical principles of the use of artificial intelligence in the judicial systems of European countries.

A common phenomenon in the study was a unique consolidated position of all categories of Orthodox respondents on the danger that artificial intelligence represents. Most Orthodox are concerned about the unpredictability of creating and using artificial intelligence, especially in a pandemic. The authors considered the position of clergy, parishioners with and without a church on the nature of artificial intelligence's influence on human potential, the threats and risks to humans that come from artificial intelligence. The main advantage of the work is the results obtained on the basis of the comparative analysis of the positions of different categories of orthodox respondents on the nature of the influence of artificial intelligence on the development of human potential.

J;Shiller, AV;;;;Shiller, Alexandra, V;;;The Place of the Ethical System in the Architecture of Artificial Intelligence;TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL;;;;;;;;;;;;"The aim of the article is to analyze the existing views on the need to develop an ethical system for artificial intelligence and to identify methodological difficulties arising from the implementation of the idea of ethical AI. The article presents arguments in favor of the relevance and importance of creating an ethical system or a set of rules of ethics and morality for an artificial agent. The stated ideas are based on the research of theorists and philosophers of AI, as well as on the results of the author's analysis of documents: current ethical codes of a number of companies and states (MIT Moral Machine, IBM Watson, Mercedes Benz autonomous cars' code, Code of Ethics for autonomous vehicles of the Government of Germany, analysis of the work of Tay and Zo chat bots from Microsoft). The article describes some methodological difficulties arising in the development of an ethical system for artificial intelligence. The complexity or impossibility of formalizing morality in a form accessible for processing by computer programs stand out among the difficulties. For example, it is challenging to describe morality in a quantitative format; put restrictions on the purity and amount of data for training the system-training on real data of people's behavior will lead to unpredictable results, since people do not tend to make decisions based on logic or rational arguments. There is a problem of data opacity or black box-the inability to trace the decision-making process of the neural network due to its extreme complexity. There is a need for an emotional system in the architecture of ethical AI; the presence of such a system makes AI more humanlike and brings in elements of negligence and errors, which is necessary when requesting to create an anthropomorphic AI. In addition, the issue of legal liability for the actions of AI and the legal status of AI in the future is raised. The levels at which AI and ethics are connected and interact with each other are revealed: the level of technical/algorithmic integration of ethics into the intellectual system; the level of regulatory and engineering methods for analyzing and evaluating ethical issues; the level of action codes, standards and certification processes, which allows developers and users to interact with AI in real time. As a conclusion, it is noted that due to the increasing involvement of AI in the everyday life of people, the development of an ethical system for AI is no longer just a matter of theoretical studies, but becomes an urgent problem with the ability to use research results or check ideas in practice. In the development of the methodology and architecture of AI systems, a great role belongs to philosophy as a source of many ethical programs and principles; therefore, philosophers need to participate in the interdisciplinary research of existing AI systems and in the development of new ones.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1561-7793;1561-803X;;;;JUL;2020;;456;;;;;99;103;;10.17223/15617793/456/11;;;;;;;WOS:000569080700011;;;;;;

Early detection through regular preliminary screening is critical to decreasing the breast cancer's fatality rate. However, the promotion of preliminary screening faces major limitations of human diagnosis capacity, cost, and technical reliability in China and most of the world. To meet these challenges, we developed a solution featuring an innovative division of labor model by incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) with ultrasonography and cloud computing. The objective of this research was to develop a solution named Dr.J, which applies AI to process real-time video live feed from ultrasonography, which is physically safe and more suitable for Asian women. It can automatically detect and highlight the suspected breast cancer lesions and provide BI-RADS (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System) ratings to assist human diagnosis. Dr.J does not require its frontline operators to have prior medical or IT background and thus significantly lowers manpower threshold for preliminary screening promotion. Furthermore, its cloud computing platform can store detailed breast cancer data such as images and BI-RADS ratings for further essential needs in medical treatment, research and health management, etc. as well as establishing a hierarchy medical service network for this disease. Therefore, Dr.J significantly enhances the availability and accessibility of preliminary screening service for breast cancer at grassroots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2158-107X;2156-5570;;;;JUL;2020;11;7;;;;;9;16;;;;;;;;;WOS:000568850200003;;;;;;

Handwriting character recognition refers to the computer's ability to detect and interpret intelligible Handwriting input from Handwriting sources such as touch screens, photographs, paper documents, and other sources. Handwriting characters remain complex since different individuals have different handwriting styles. This paper aims to report the development of a Handwriting character recognition system that will be used to read students and lectures Handwriting notes. The development is based on an artificial neural network, which is a field of study in artificial intelligence. Different techniques and methods are used to develop a Handwriting character recognition system. However, few of them focus on neural networks. The use of neural networks for recognizing Handwriting characters is more efficient and robust compared with other computing techniques. The paper also outlines the methodology, design, and architecture of the Handwriting character recognition system and testing and results of the system development. The aim is to demonstrate the effectiveness of neural networks for Handwriting character recognition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2158-107X;2156-5570;;;;JUL;2020;11;7;;;;;137;146;;;;;;;;;WOS:000568850200020;;;;;;

However, HDR images need to be converted to low dynamic range (LDR) images for viewing on standard LDR display screens. Several tone-mapping operators have been proposed for the conversion, however, so far, no significant works have been reported employing artificial intelligence to achieve better enhancement of the output images. In this paper, we present an optimization-based approach, to enhance the quality of the tone-mapped LDR images using metaheuristics. More specifically, the optimization process is based on the differential evolution (DE) algorithm which takes tone-mapping function of an existing histogram-based method as initial guess and refines the histogram bins iteratively leading to progressive enhancement of the quality of LDR image. The final results produced by the proposed optimized histogram-based approach (OHbA) showed better performance compared to the existing state-of-the-art tone-mapping algorithms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2158-107X;2156-5570;;;;JUL;2020;11;7;;;;;341;347;;;;;;;;;WOS:000568850200046;;;;;;

Nango; Ouattara, Sie; Clement, Alain";;;A New Strategy for the Morphological and Colorimetric Recognition of Erythrocytes for the Diagnosis of Forms of Anemia based on Microscopic Color Images of Blood Smears;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS;;;;;;;;;;;;The detection of red blood cells based on morphology and colorimetric appearance is very important in improving hematology diagnostics. There are automatons capable of detecting certain forms, but these have limitations with regard to the formal identification of red blood cells because they consider certain cells to be red blood cells when they are not and vice versa. Other automata have limitations in their operation because they do not cover a sufficient area of the blood smear. In spite of their performance, biologists have very often resorted to the manual analysis of blood smears under an optical microscope for a morphological and colorimetric study. In this paper, we present a new strategy for semi-automatic identification of red blood cells based on their isolation, their automatic color segmentation using Otsu's algorithm and their morphology. The algorithms of our method have been implemented in the programming environment of the scientific software MATLAB resulting in an artificial intelligence application. The application, once launched, allows the biologist to select a region of interest containing the erythrocyte to be characterized, then a set of attributes are computed extracted from this target red blood cell. These attributes include compactness, perimeter, area, morphology, white and red proportions of the erythrocyte, etc. The types of anemia treated in this work concern the iron-deficiency, sickle-cell or falciform, thalassemia, hemolytic, etc. forms. The results obtained are excellent because they highlight different forms of anemia contracted in a patient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2158-107X;2156-5570;;;;JUL;2020;11;7;;;;;488;497;;;;;;;;;WOS:000568850200063;;;;;;

Computer-aided diagnosis is an efficient method for assisting medical experts in early diagnosis, improving the chance of recovery. Employing artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical area is very crucial due to the sensitivity of this field. This means that the low accuracy of the classification methods used for cancer detection is a critical issue. This problem is accentuated when it comes to blurry mammogram images. In this paper, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed to present the traditional convolutional neural network (TCNN) and supported convolutional neural network (SCNN) approaches. The TCNN and SCNN approaches contribute by overcoming the shift and scaling problems included in blurry mammogram images. In addition, the flipped rotation-based approach (FRbA) is proposed to enhance the accuracy of the prediction process (classification of the type of cancerous mass) by taking into account the different directions of the cancerous mass to extract effective features to form the map of the tumour. The proposed approaches are implemented on the MIAS medical dataset using 200 mammogram breast images. Compared to similar approaches based on KNN and RF, the proposed approaches show better performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, spasticity, precision, recall, time of performance, and quality of image metrics.;;;;;Mezher, Mohd/0000-0003-3607-5701;;;;;;;;;;;;2158-107X;2156-5570;;;;JUL;2020;11;7;;;;;498;513;;;;;;;;;WOS:000568850200064;;;;;;

Thus, industries are faced to serious challenges in terms of products qualities, time development and production cost. As assembly operations difficulties cause a big part of production problems, the integration of assembly selection since the earlier product life cycle phases has become a necessity for every company in order to survive. However, despite the large number of approaches that have been proposed in order to achieve this integration goal, many other problems are still present. It is in this context that a flexible and automated decision making system is proposed. It is based on ontologies and also on the Case Based Reasoning (CBR) and Rule Based Reasoning (RBR) concepts. Indeed, this system is an automation of the integrated DFMMA approach, in particular its assembly solution selection methodology. The developed system permits to designers avoiding the redundancy in the works by benefiting from their previous studies and their experience. In addition to that, it facilitates and automates the assembly solution selection even if the number of assembly alternatives is high. Finally, to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed system, a case of study is developed in the end of the work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2158-107X;2156-5570;;;;JUL;2020;11;7;;;;;586;603;;;;;;;;;WOS:000568850200073;;;;;;

In the traditional deep Q-networks (DQNs), it is subjected to random pickup of samples into the experience replay. However, the effect of each sample is different for the training process of agent. A better sampling method will make the agent training more effective. Therefore, when selecting a sample to the experience replay, the authors first allow the agent to learn randomly through the sample optimisation network, and take the average value returned after each study, so that the mean value is used as a threshold for selecting samples to the experience replay. Second, on the basis of sample optimisation, the authors increase the priority update and use the idea of reward-shaping to give additional reward values to the returns of certain samples, which speeds up the agent training. Compared with traditional DQN and the prioritised experience replay DQN, this study uses OpenAI Gym as platform to improve agent learning efficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2051-3305;;;;JUL;2020;2020;13;;;;;298;302;;10.1049/joe.2019.1204;;;;;;;WOS:000565270600002;;;;;;

In this study, based on collaborative representation and graph embedding, the authors propose a new linear dimensionality reduction method called collaborative representation-based locality preserving projection (CRLPP). In the CRLPP, they assume that the similar samples should have similar reconstructions by collaborative representation and the similar reconstructions should also have the similar low-dimensional representations in the projected subspace. CRLPP first reconstructs each training sample using the collaborative representation of the other remaining training samples, and then designs the graph construction of all training samples, finally establishes the objective function of graph embedding using the collaborative reconstructions and the constructed graph. The proposed CRLPP can well preserve the intrinsic geometrical and discriminant structures of high-dimensional data in low-dimensional subspace. The effectiveness of the proposed is verified on several image datasets.

However, traditional metric learning algorithms, e.g. large margin nearest neighbour (LMNN), information-theoretic metric learning, neighbourhood component analysis, do not take imbalanced distributions of classes into consideration. The traditional methods are apt to be affected by the majority samples, so those important minority samples are often ignored during the learning phase of distance metrics matrix, this may gravely confuse decision-making systems on classifying samples. In order to resolve this problem, the authors propose a novel metric-learning method named balancing large margin nearest neighbour (BLMNN) for imbalanced data. BLMNN can improve the objective function according to the distribution of classes, which treats the minority and majority classes equally during the optimisation process. Thus, the contribution of minority class is taken into full consideration, which can greatly improve the accuracy of classification. Substantial experiments were performed on real-world imbalanced datasets.

Usually, the industrial PCB imagery has high resolution, but defects take up a small proportion (often only similar to 10 pixels in size), which makes it difficult to use traditional machine vision methods. To this end, a novel single shot object detector (SSDT) is proposed for tiny defect detection in PCBs in this study. Specifically, a semantic ascending module, which propagates the semantic property of deep layers to shallow layers, is presented by fusing features of different levels. An attention mechanism is utilised to learn the relationship of the features to be fused across channels and a shuffle module is used to eliminate the aliasing effect after fusion. Moreover, the improved non-maximum suppression is proposed to extenuate the overlap effect for testing the whole PCB image. The proposed detector can rapidly detect tiny defects and the results of SSD and SSDT are further compared not only in PCB defect dataset but also the object detection public dataset PASCAL VOC2007 where SSDT achieves 81.3% mAP, better than SSD (79.5%).

However, micro-blog sentiment classification is a challenging task, because micro-blog messages are short and noisy, and contain massive user-invented acronyms and informal words. Unfortunately, most researchers pay more attention to analyse the data after deep learning, but only simply remove the noisy data before using algorithm, so the result of sentiment analysis has reached a bottleneck.

On the basis of the traditional alpha-beta search algorithm, the worthless nodes are discarded to be never searched by introducing the deep iterative, history table and other auxiliary methods of pruning. The number of nodes searched is effectively reduced to make the pruning earlier to shorten the search time. At the same time, its search depth is higher than the original search algorithm.

The actor network and critic network in SMI-DHP algorithm utilise multi-kernel feature representations for the optimal policy and value function approximations. Compared with single-kernel designs, the adopted multi-kernel structure consists of a linear combination of weighted single-kernel functions, including multiple but different kernel widths selected orderly from the candidate range, which is capable in reducing the complexity of kernel width parameter tuning. In order to restrain the size of weights in actor and critic modules, l(2)-regularisation is applied in the proposed approach. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, the simulation results on a non-linear inverted pendulum are reported, which show that the SMI-DHP algorithm with multi-kernels can learn successfully while about half of them failed with the learning manner of the single kernel. To further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the experimental tests on a real inverted pendulum system are also studied. The corresponding results indicate that the control performance of the proposed approach is comparative to the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller and better than traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2051-3305;;;;JUL;2020;2020;13;;;;;454;459;;10.1049/joe.2019.1215;;;;;;;WOS:000565270600032;;;;;;

This study presents a deep multi-task classification framework for scene recognition involving special traffic conditions. The framework incorporates four learning tasks where the recognition of special traffic scenes is the chief task and the time of occurrence (daytime or night-time), the weather type and the road attribute are the three auxiliary tasks for improving the recognition performance. The four tasks share the feature map generated by a convolutional neural network followed by task-specific sub-networks which are merged in the end via a joint loss function. Moreover, a small dataset of typical special traffic conditions was built for training and testing the recognition model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of scene recognition under special traffic conditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2051-3305;;;;JUL;2020;2020;13;;;;;471;475;;10.1049/joe.2019.1191;;;;;;;WOS:000565270600035;;;;;;

This study the problem of multi-robot pursuit game using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques is studied. Unlike most existing studies that apply fully centralised deep RL methods based on the centralised-learning and decentralised-execution scheme, the authors propose a fully decentralised multi-agent deep RL approach by modelling each agent as an individual deep RL agent that has its own individual learning system (i.e. individual action-value function, individual leaning update process, and individual action output). To realise coordination among agents, the limited information of other environmental agents is used as input of the learning process.

In practical industrial scenarios, defects on a printed circuit board account generally for a small proportion, so the data sets are highly biased towards no defect class. To this end, unknown defect detection can be treated as an anomaly detection problem. According to this, a semi-supervised learning method is proposed in this study to solve the above-mentioned problems. Inspired by the conditional generative adversarial network, the authors propose an improved end-to-end architecture for detecting unknown defects. The designed architecture is composed of three networks: a generator, a discriminator, and an encoder. Among them, the generator and the discriminator are trained by competing with each other, while collaborating to learn the distribution of underlying concepts in the target class. During training, the authors only train normal samples, and unknown defects do not appear in the process. In the testing phase, unknown defects are detected by calculating the distance between generated samples and real samples under the feature space. Experimental results over several benchmark data sets show the effectiveness of the model and superiority on state-of-the-art approaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2051-3305;;;;JUL;2020;2020;13;;;;;505;510;;10.1049/joe.2019.1181;;;;;;;WOS:000565270600042;;;;;;

The classical obstacle avoidance algorithms are mostly suitable for mobile robots, but these algorithms are not ideal for UAV using in three-dimensional space. Most of the three-dimensional obstacle avoidance algorithms which are more effective using RGB image data as input. Thus, a large amount of image data is involved in complex computing process. This study proposes an effective obstacle avoidance algorithm for UAV with less input data and fewer sensors based on RealSense and reinforcement learning. It combines the feature map of the depth image of RealSense as the input data of reinforcement learning and the current direction of flight of UAV to calculate the direction and angle of avoiding.

The authors concatenate the input image of the network and the feature maps generated by the former layers before entering the subsequent layers. The convolutional layers reusing the original image are called ROIC (Reusing Original Image Convolutional) layers. They take the original image as a part of their inputs.

To overcome this problem, this article proposes an explainable image captioning model, which provides a visual link between the region of an object (or a concept) in the given image and the particular word (or phrase) in the generated sentence.

Therefore, it would be meaningful to conduct the same experiment with these new models. Here, the authors predict the household electric energy consumption using deep learning models, known to be suitable for dealing with time-series data. Specifically, vanilla long short-term memory (LSTM), sequence to sequence, and sequence to sequence with attention mechanism are used to predict the electric energy consumption in the household. As a result, the vanilla LSTM shows the best performance on the root-mean-square error metric. However, from a graphical point of view, it seems that the sequence-to-sequence model predicts the energy consumption patterns best and the vanilla LSTM does not follow the pattern well.

This study presents a body window sampling algorithm based on binarised normed gradients, which can quickly and effectively extract the window of the image that most likely contains human body to be identified, thus greatly improving the detection speed and obtaining a lower false alarm rate. The authors employ the histogram of oriented gradient feature and the linear support vector machine to train the classifier. For the same false test case in comparison with the pyramid scanning method, when the authors used 2,000 sampling windows for detection, they observed a detection rate increase of 11%, the detection speed increased 19.6 times.

However, it has issues in the following circumstances: (i) if information instead of correctness is more important, we should use the maximum likelihood criterion or maximum information criterion, which can reduce the rate of failure to report small probability events. (ii) For unseen instance classifications, the previously optimised classifier cannot be properly used when the probability distribution of true classes is changed. (iii) When classes' feature distributions instead of transition probability functions (TPFs) are stable, it is improper to train the TPF, such as the logistic function, with parameters. (iv) For multi-label classifications, it is difficult to optimise a group of TPFs with parameters that the Bayes classifier needs. This study addresses these issues by comparing the MPP criterion with the maximum likelihood criterion and maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion. It suggests using the MMI criterion for most unseen instance classifications. It presents a new iterative algorithm, the channel matching (CM) algorithm, for the MMI classification.

However, CF-based trackers possess two potential drawbacks: the search regions are limited to the small local neighbourhood for the high-speed tracking purpose; thus, they usually have very few context information and tend to drift from a target in extreme attributes, e.g. background clutter, large-scale variation, and fast motion. Another is that once the tracking target is lost under large displacement motion, it cannot be re-identified in subsequent frames. In this study, the authors propose a unified tracking-and-detection framework with distractor-aware (UTDF-DA), which involves both context learning and target re-identification with a target-aware detector to solve the drawbacks mentioned above. They first incorporate the distractor constraint as context knowledge into a continuous correlation filter for distractor-aware filter learning. Then a single-shot multibox detector-based target-aware detector is trained by domain-specific meta-training approach for deep detection features and hard-negative samples generation. Moreover, they propose the spatial-scale consistency verification method for the target re-identification task. Compared with existing state-of-the-art trackers,UTDF-DA(the authors') tracker can achieve improved tracking performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness; they demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency with comprehensive experiments on OTB-2015, VOT-2016, and VOT-2017 benchmarks.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2051-3305;;;;JUL;2020;2020;13;;;;;679;685;;10.1049/joe.2019.1205;;;;;;;WOS:000565270600075;;;;;;

Simulation is a valuable tool for assessing and developing surgical skills in a controlled and safe environment. The use of simulation as a formal component of training has been increasing in various surgical subspecialties. In general surgery, simulation examinations such as the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery and Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery have become a prerequisite to board certification. Although formal simulation examinations in plastic surgery are not universal, there has been an increase in the use of simulation to increase resident competency in the operating room. For now, we will review the current state of simulation in craniofacial, hand, microvascular, and esthetic surgery and discuss applications for the future. We will also discuss the evolving role of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality in plastic surgery training and testing.;;;;Agrawal, Nikhil/K-5252-2019;Agrawal, Nikhil/0000-0001-9248-7554;;;;;;;;;;;;2169-7574;;;;;JUL;2020;8;7;;;;;;;e2896;10.1097/GOX.0000000000002896;;;;;;;WOS:000562717200012;32802639;;;;;

These technologies direct managers to a new paradigm where there are fewer human interferences and the system is intelligent and interconnected. This new paradigm, called Turismo 4.0, emerges as a way to increase the potential of innovation in the tourism sector, using the main technologies of the Industry 4.0 training, which are: Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems, Big Data, Data Security, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Autonomous Robots, Cloud and Horizontal and Vertical Integration of Information Technology Systems. This new paradigm establishes a collaborative ecosystem involving local people, local authorities, tourists, service providers and government, co-creating an enriched tourism experience in both the physical and digital worlds. In this sense, it was awakened to the formulation of the following problem question: What are the main debates and studies about management model from the perspective of the digital revolution in the scope of Turismo 4.0? Therefore, this article aimed to analyze the management model of Turismo 4.0, in the context of the digital revolution. For this, it was chosen to carry out a qualitative research, a bibliographical and electronic depth on the subject. In addition, it was decided to carry out a descriptive and exploratory literature review. The procedure of data collection consisted of the survey of relevant articles within the literature on the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The databases used were: Go ogle Scholar and Science Direct, with use of specific keywords. The results indicate that there are few studies in this area, and that before so many technologies and advances, it is evident how the Brazilian tourist market is still obsolete in front of this new era. In the end, it was concluded that Industry 4.0 has to prove its benefits to society and only when its technologies, regulations and changes prove to be better for people, should its full potential be realized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2316-1493;;;;;JUL-DEC;2020;9;2;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000562679900013;;;;;;

Emerging methods for automated content analysis of social media data offers opportunities to discover information on cultural ecosystem services from photographs across large samples of people and countries. We analysed over 800 000 Flickr photographs using Google's Cloud Vision algorithm to identify the components of the natural environment most photographed and to map how and where different people interact with nature across eight Arctic countries. Almost all (91.1%) of users took one or more photographs of biotic nature, and such photos account for over half (53.2%) of Arctic photos on Flickr. We find that although the vast majority of Arctic human-nature interactions occur outside protected areas, people are slightly more likely to photograph nature inside protected areas after accounting for the low accessibility of Arctic protected areas. Wildlife photographers travel further from roads than people who take fewer photographs of wildlife, and people venture much further from roads inside protected areas. A large diversity of nature was reflected in the photographs, from mammals, birds, fish, fungi, plants and invertebrates, signalling an untapped potential to connect and engage people in the appreciation and conservation of the natural world. Our findings suggest that, despite limitations, automated content analysis can be a rapid and readily accessed source of data on how and where people interact with nature, and a large-scale method for assessing cultural ecosystem services across countries and cultures.;;;;Runge, Claire/Q-2110-2018;Runge, Claire/0000-0003-3913-8560;;;;;;;;;;;;2515-7620;;;;;JUL 1;2020;2;7;;;;;;;75001;10.1088/2515-7620/ab9c33;;;;;;;WOS:000561425700001;;;;;;

Both knowledge and technology can be essential in artwork conservation. Without such knowledge, the lifespan of numerous works of art by artists spanning over centuries might have been compromised and consequently not exist today. Artwork naturally deteriorates over time or can be damaged unknowingly through artificial processes. Art conservators strive to improve the condition of artwork through non-destructive preservation and restoration procedures. These can be time consuming and require significant patience when diagnosing artwork and applying the suitable process. For many years this work has been assisted by various technologies such as photography, x-ray imaging, and speckle pattern interferometry. More recently there has been an introduction of newer technologies allowing conservators to gather even more details about the artwork. Improvements to classic analytical tools such as spectroscopy and infrared imaging have been applied to artwork analysis. Moreover, the use of computing power for photogrammetry and artificial intelligence for pattern recognition have seen use in studying artwork digitally. This article provides a review of the state-of-the-art technologies used in art conservation with some investigation into their established counterparts. Some of the technologies covered here include x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, holographic interferometry, Raman spectroscopy, thermal-quasi reflectography, and terahertz imaging. These techniques allow the detailed analysis of paintings, murals, statues, and other artefacts providing details about the surface topology, stylometry, pigment and media constituents, and restoration history. The integration of all these factors can provide art conservators and historians with important information on various artwork and ultimately assist in conservation for many years to come.

In this paper, I look to understand Mary Shelley's Frankenstein influence on people's attitudes regarding technology and science, particularly artificial intelligence and robots. How the negative visions and fears about the misuse of science to break traditional moral and religious boundaries are still present in popular culture. Fieldwork will be focused on reviewing several Latin American newspapers and magazine articles in Spanish and Portuguese published on the Internet.

Coupled with new technology such as artificial intelligence and deep learning, the potential of big data is poised to be harnessed to its maximal in years to come. In ophthalmology, given the data-intensive nature of this specialty, big data will similarly play an important role. Electronic medical records, administrative and health insurance databases, mega national biobanks, crowd source data from mobile applications and social media, and international epidemiology consortia are emerging forms of big data in ophthalmology. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of big data, its potential applications in ophthalmology, and the challenges in leveraging and using these data.

A combination of the increasing availability of large datasets and computing power with revolutionary progress in deep learning has created unprecedented opportunities for major breakthrough improvements in the performance and accuracy of automated diagnoses that primarily focus on image recognition and feature detection. Such an automated disease classification would significantly improve the accessibility, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of eye care systems where it is less dependent on human input, potentially enabling diagnosis to be cheaper, quicker, and more consistent. Although this technology will have a profound impact on clinical flow and practice patterns sooner or later, translating such a technology into clinical practice is challenging and requires similar levels of accountability and effectiveness as any new medication or medical device due to the potential problems of bias, and ethical, medical, and legal issues that might arise.

ICPs represent an effective tool for resource management in the public and private health domains. To be automatically executed, the ICP process has to be described by means of complex general purpose description language (GPDL) formalisms. However, GPDLs make the process model difficult to grasp by a human. On the other hand, the adoption of a reduced set of graphical constructs prevents a fully automated process execution due to the lack of information required by a machine. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find a balance between modelling language expressiveness and the automated execution of the modelled processes. In this paper, we present a meta-model based on a GPDL to organize the ICP process knowledge. This meta-model allows the management of ICP information in a way that is independent from the graphic representation of the adopted modelling standard. We also propose a general framework and a methodology that aim to guarantee a high degree of automation in process execution. In particular, the corresponding execution engine is implemented as a chatbot (integrated with social media), which plays a two-fold role: during the actual execution of the entire ICP, it acts as a virtual assistant and gathers the patient's health data. Tests performed on a real ICP showed that, thanks to the proposed solution, the chatbot engine is able to engage in a dialogue with the patient. We provide discussion about how the system could be extended and how it could be seen as an alternative to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based approaches.;;;;;"Caivano, Danilo/0000-0001-5719-7447; Colizzi, Lucio/0000-0003-2840-7235";;;;;;;;;;;;;2078-2489;;;;JUL;2020;11;7;;;;;;;362;10.3390/info11070362;;;;;;;WOS:000557831300001;;;;;;

Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been applied in diagnostic radiology. The purpose of developing such applications is to clinically validate and make them feasible for the current practice of diagnostic radiology, in which there is less time for diagnosis. Purpose: To assess radiologists' knowledge about AI's role and establish a baseline to help in providing educational activities on AI in diagnostic radiology in Saudi Arabia. Material and Methods: An online questionnaire was designed using QuestionPro software. The study was conducted in large hospitals located in different regions in Saudi Arabia. A total of 93 participants completed the questionnaire, of which 32 (34%) were trainee radiologists from year 1 to year 4 (R1-R4) of the residency programme, 33 (36%) were radiologists and fellows, and 28 (30%) were consultants. Results: The responses to the question related to the use of AI on a daily basis illustrated that 76 (82%) of the participants were not using any AI software at all during daily interpretation of diagnostic images. Only 17 (18%) reported that they used AI software for diagnostic radiology. Conclusion: There is a significant lack of knowledge about AI in our residency programme and radiology departments at hospitals.

Their ability to go beyond human precision has made these networks a milestone in the history of AI. However, while on the one hand they present cutting edge performance, on the other hand they require enormous computing power. For this reason, numerous optimization techniques at the hardware and software level, and specialized architectures, have been developed to process these models with high performance and power/energy efficiency without affecting their accuracy. In the past, multiple surveys have been reported to provide an overview of different architectures and optimization techniques for efficient execution of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. This work aims at providing an up-to-date survey, especially covering the prominent works from the last 3 years of the hardware architectures research for DNNs. In this paper, the reader will first understand what a hardware accelerator is, and what are its main components, followed by the latest techniques in the field of dataflow, reconfigurability, variable bit-width, and sparsity.;;;;;"Shafique, Muhammad/0000-0002-2607-8135; Masera, Guido/0000-0003-2238-9443; Capra, Maurizio/0000-0003-2500-2283; Bussolino, Beatrice/0000-0003-2608-820X; Marchisio, Alberto/0000-0002-0689-4776";;;;;;;;;;;;;1999-5903;;;;JUL;2020;12;7;;;;;;;113;10.3390/fi12070113;;;;;;;WOS:000557010900001;;;;;;

For several years now, it has been an important research field to try to understand how the disease progresses and find effective medical treatments. Researchers have been mostly interested in studying the evolution of the lesions using different techniques ranging from manual annotation to mathematical models of the disease. However, artificial intelligence for ARMD image analysis has become one of the main research focuses to study the progression of the disease, as accurate manual annotation of its evolution has proved difficult using traditional methods even for experienced practicians. In this paper, we propose a deep learning architecture that can detect changes in the eye fundus images and assess the progression of the disease. Our method is based on joint autoencoders and is fully unsupervised. Our algorithm has been applied to pairs of images from different eye fundus images time series of 24 ARMD patients. Our method has been shown to be quite effective when compared with other methods from the literature, including non-neural network based algorithms that still are the current standard to follow the disease progression and change detection methods from other fields.;;;;Kalinicheva, Ekaterina/ABB-9659-2020;"Kalinicheva, Ekaterina/0000-0001-8332-2491; Sublime, Jeremie/0000-0003-0508-8550";;;;;;;;;;;;;2313-433X;;;;JUL;2020;6;7;;;;;;;57;10.3390/jimaging6070057;;;;;;;WOS:000557098200001;;;;;;

Seeking to eradicate suffering and death and transcend the limits of biology, transhumanists celebrate the power of technology to transform human life. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was intrigued by computer technology and its potential to link humankind on a new level of a global mind. He has been labeled a forerunner of transhumanism; however, his theological vision is not about enhancement but transformation. He recognized that suffering and death are invaluable to the emergence of unitive love, exemplified in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Teilhard's vision helps us realize that suffering in nature may appear as erratic and absurd; however, in light of God's kenotic love, suffering is oriented toward freedom and the fullness of love.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2077-1444;;;;JUL;2020;11;7;;;;;;;335;10.3390/rel11070335;;;;;;;WOS:000557688600001;;;;;;

As the bag of words paradigm's limitations become increasingly discernible in modern applications, several information retrieval and artificial intelligence tasks are shifting to semantic representations for addressing the inherent natural language polysemy and homonymy challenges. With extensive application in a broad range of scientific fields, such as digital marketing, bioinformatics, chemical engineering, neuroscience, and social sciences, community detection has attracted great scientific interest. Focusing on linguistics, by aiming to identify groups of densely interconnected subgroups of semantic ontologies, community detection application has proven beneficial in terms of disambiguation improvement and ontology enhancement. In this paper we introduce a novel distributed supervised knowledge-based methodology employing community detection algorithms for text annotation with Wikipedia Entities, establishing the unprecedented concept of community Coherence as a metric for local contextual coherence compatibility. Our experimental evaluation revealed that deeper inference of relatedness and local entity community coherence in the Wikipedia graph bears substantial improvements overall via a focus on accuracy amelioration of less common annotations. The proposed methodology is propitious for wider adoption, attaining robust disambiguation performance.;;;;;"Makris, Christos/0000-0003-2571-7449; Simos, Michael Angelos/0000-0001-9012-8240";;;;;;;;;;;;;1999-4893;;;;JUL;2020;13;7;;;;;;;160;10.3390/a13070160;;;;;;;WOS:000556516800001;;;;;;

The main objective of this paper consists in analyzing bank experiences when they introduce AI from the theory of dynamic capabilities and the resource-based view approach. Documentary research enables the description of experiences in three companies from the financial industry. It has been considered of interest to include different international experiences. For that reason, a firm providing debit and credit card services has been included, MasterCard, along with international banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Caixa Bank. Results show that AI enables firms to promote new relationships with customers, detect their needs or experiences, and adapt the service given by firms to be more competitive. AI also allows them to speed up responses to customers answers and doubts through its value chain. This research also shows that the proper implementation of AI permits a reconfiguration of traditional banking scenario. Detection, absorption, integration, and innovation are capabilities that allow these firms to build the managerial skills oriented to save costs, increase efficiency, and be more competitive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1548-1115;1548-1123;;;;JUL-SEP;2020;16;3;;;SI;;20;33;;10.4018/IJEIS.2020070102;;;;;;;WOS:000555978600003;;;;;;

It is very important to analyze, identify and track those directions that we believe will drive energy trading in order to be able to design and create new sustainable business models. We highlight the possibilities and ways of improving the energy trading, analyzing the rapid evolution of the field, generated by the emergence of several new factors that can influence this industry. Beside those directions at which electricity trading is heading in the Digital Era, the research also describes main innovations in the field such as Smart Grids, Blockchain Technology, Peer-to-peer trading platforms and Demand Response through which the purpose is to attract final consumers to the energy trading on web platforms or mobile applications with which they can properly control their electric appliances and self-generation units in their homes, all these supervised and guided by artificial intelligence. The type of research proposed to identify the current condition and to be able to develop new trading models is empirical research through qualitative analysis. Beyond incentives and monetary benefits, the focus is on final consumer education and increased awareness towards a more conscious, optimal and rational consumption of electricity that can lead to both a better use of the energy production from renewable sources and a reduction of pollutant fossil fuel electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions without endangering the proper functioning of the electricity systems. Previous researches are based more on incentivizing or penalizing end consumers in present paper, more emphasis is placed on attracting the end consumer to his own electricity trading through mentioned innovation, but also supervised and guided by artificial intelligence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2502-0226;2558-9652;;;;JUL;2020;14;1;;;;;16;27;;10.2478/picbe-2020-0003;;;;;;;WOS:000556549000003;;;;;;

The tendencies of applying the concepts coming from AI, together with the continuous increase of the volume, complexity and variety of the data that the banks collect, store and process have acquired the generic names of FinTech, respectively BigTech. Five main areas exist where Fintechs and Bigtechs can provide improvements in business models for the banks: introducing specialized platforms, covering neglected customer segments, improving customer selection, reduction of the operating costs of the banks, and optimization of the business processes of the banks. We will present some of these improvements, and then we will show how the business models of the banks dramatically transform under the influence of these changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2502-0226;2558-9652;;;;JUL;2020;14;1;;;;;294;305;;10.2478/picbe-2020-0028;;;;;;;WOS:000556549000028;;;;;;

Much of what has been reported in the literature has an anecdotal nature. The development of knowledge management as a distinct domain has historically been influenced by research undertaken in a wide range of disciplines. These disciplines include sociology, psychology and philosophy. Since the early 1990s, research in the area of knowledge management has expanded into contiguous areas such as change management, systems theory, organizational theory, organizational learning &development and artificial intelligence. During the past years, there has been a great deal of interest in knowledge as an organizational and commercial variable, with the need to better understand the processes of knowledge transfer in organizations. In this paper, I present and develop the following questions: What kind of knowledge should we transfer? How should we transfer knowledge between entities? What is the impact of knowledge transfer on organizational performance? To develop the previously mentioned questions, a quantitative research based on a questionnaire has been applied on a sample of 100 people who are working in a certain shared services centre. The main purpose of the research is to identify the impact of knowledge sharing on organizational performance and to analyze the importance of having a solid base of information in order to achieve excellent organizational performance. The result is that knowledge transfer has an impact on the company's vision, continuous learning and business performance. The way knowledge is managed in a company is crucial to gain a competitive advantage, this being recognized by the respondents as important for achieving the following goals: project success and self-improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2502-0226;2558-9652;;;;JUL;2020;14;1;;;;;577;588;;10.2478/picbe-2020-0054;;;;;;;WOS:000556549000054;;;;;;

The role of information systems in organizations expanded continuously, including recording, organizing, processing, storage, dissemination and making available the information, until the revolutionary emergence of artificial intelligence. The role of knowledge creation is no longer exclusive to humans. Artificial intelligence becomes a partner entity of employees in knowledge creation processes in organizations. This article investigates how artificial intelligence can be incorporated in knowledge creation processes. Starting from the study of scientific literature, this article presents concepts and taxonomies associated with the use of artificial intelligence in the processes of knowledge creation in organizations. The study is a first step in a larger research, which aims to identify the main consequences, on employees and organizations, of the incorporation of artificial intelligence in the processes of knowledge creation.;;;;Andrei, Nestian G Stefan/U-6923-2017;Andrei, Nestian G Stefan/0000-0002-3499-3245;;;;;;;;;;;;2502-0226;2558-9652;;;;JUL;2020;14;1;;;;;597;606;;10.2478/picbe-2020-0056;;;;;;;WOS:000556549000056;;;;;;

C.; Lu, Yan; Frechette, Simon";;;Foundations of Information Governance for Smart Manufacturing;SMART AND SUSTAINABLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS;;;;;;;;;;;;The manufacturing systems of the future will be even more dependent on data than they are today. More and more data and information are being collected and communicated throughout product development life cycles and across manufacturing value chains. To enable smarter manufacturing operations, new equipment often includes built-in data collection capabilities. Older equipment can be retrofitted inexpensively with sensors to collect a wide variety of data. Many manufacturers are in a quandary as to what to do with increasing quantities of data. Much hype currently surrounds the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to process large data sets, but manufacturers struggle to understand how AI can be applied to improve manufacturing system performance. The gap lies in the lack of good information governance practices for manufacturing. This paper defines information governance in the manufacturing context as the set of principles that allows for consistent, repeatable, and trustworthy processing and use of data. The paper identifies three foundations for good information governance that are needed in the manufacturing environment-data quality, semantic context, and system context-and reviews the surrounding and evolving body of work. The work includes a broad base of standard methods that combine to create reusable information from raw data formats. An example from an additive manufacturing case study is used to show how those detailed specifications create the governance needed to build trust in the systems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2520-6478;2572-3928;;;;JUL;2020;4;2;;;SI;;43;61;;10.1520/SSMS20190041;;;;;;;WOS:000555387900003;;;;;;

Since the breakthrough publication of the original Khorana risk score (KRS) more than 10 years ago, a new generation of KRS-based scores have been developed, including the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study, PROTECHT, CONKO, ONCOTEV, TicOnco and the CATS/MICA score. Among these the CATS/MICA score showed that a simplified score composed of only two calibrated predictors, the type of cancer and the D-dimer levels, offers a user-friendly tool for the evaluation of cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) risk. The COMPASS-CAT score is the first that introduced a more synthetic approach of risk evaluation by combining cancer-related predictors with patient comorbidity in a score which is designed for the types of cancer frequently seen in the community (i.e. breast, lung colon or ovarian cancers) and has been externally validated in independent studies. The Throly score is registered as part of the same group as it has a similar structure to the COMPASS-CAT score and is applicable in patients with lymphoma. The incorporation of specific biomarkers of hypercoagulability to the RAM for CAT offers the possibility to perform a precision medicine approach in the prevention of CAT. The improvement of RAM for CAT with artificial intelligence methodologies and deep learning techniques is the challenge in the near future.;;;;Mahe, Isabelle/ABA-3641-2020;Mahe, Isabelle/0000-0003-1760-7880;;;;;;;;;;;;0049-3848;1879-2472;;;;JUL;2020;191;;;1;;;S50;S57;;;;;;;;;WOS:000555314400010;32736779;;;;;

Existing technology has advanced nursing in many ways and contributed to patient safety but at the cost of decreasing nurse-patient interaction. As health care technology progresses to the inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI), the future impact on nursing and direct patient care remains largely unknown, unexplored, and difficult to predict. This article aims to explore the relevance of nursing in a technologically advanced postmodern health care system. The relevance of nursing in the future is solidified by the unique nature of nursing that includes the embodiment of human caring and emotional intelligence. Nurses' abilities to intervene before patient deterioration, care for patients holistically, and manage various aspects of care will be heightened by the adoption of AI. Nurses should embrace AI technology, as we predict that it will decrease nurse workload and cognitive overload and allow for increased patient-nurse interaction. Current and future nurses should take the lead on determining how it augments nursing practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0887-9303;1550-5111;;;;JUL-SEP;2020;43;3;;;SI;;303;311;;10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000315;;;;;;;WOS:000553324300006;32433071;;;;;

In both cases a comparison is made against the most relevant and latest state of the art crowd counting architectures, showing that our proposed MH-MetroNet architecture outperforms in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Square Error (MSE) and passenger-crowd people number prediction.;;;;"Nitti, Massimiliano/AAW-5703-2020; Spagnolo, Paolo/AAX-7082-2020; Reno, Vito/AAF-5723-2019; Mazzeo, Pier Luigi/AAA-5053-2020; Distante, Cosimo/M-7996-2013";"Nitti, Massimiliano/0000-0002-0555-3443; Spagnolo, Paolo/0000-0001-9129-9375; Reno, Vito/0000-0003-1830-4961; Mazzeo, Pier Luigi/0000-0002-7552-2394; Distante, Cosimo/0000-0002-1073-2390";;;;;;;;;;;;;2313-433X;;;;JUL;2020;6;7;;;;;;;62;10.3390/jimaging6070062;;;;;;;WOS:000554271800001;;;;;;

Ontology extension achieves the purpose of expanding ontology by adding new concepts and discovering the relationships between concepts in the existing ontology. In order to improve the automation and accuracy of ontology concept extraction in the Uyghur language, here the authors propose a new method to automatically extract concepts from text collection. For the characteristics of the Uyghur domain ontology concept, the text preprocessing is performed first, then the inter-word correlation of multi-feature fusion is calculated, such as Mi, Cd and Ea, and finally, the domain terminology and concept are automatically extracted, according to the term frequency-inverse document frequency algorithm. Experiment results show that, in terms of precision and recall rate, the multi-feature method proposed here represents an improvement over other methods. It also proves the feasibility and effectiveness of the authors' method to extract the domain concept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2047-4954;2047-4962;;;;JUL;2020;9;4;;;;;200;205;;10.1049/iet-net.2018.5240;;;;;;;WOS:000552132700007;;;;;;

Over 40% of people with T1D manage their glucose through multiple injections of long-acting basal and short-acting bolus insulin, so-called multiple daily injections (MDI)(1,2). Errors in dosing can lead to life-threatening hypoglycaemia events (<70 mg dl(-1)) and hyperglycaemia (>180 mg dl(-1)), increasing the risk of retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Machine learning (artificial intelligence) approaches are being harnessed to incorporate decision support into many medical specialties. Here, we report an algorithm that provides weekly insulin dosage recommendations to adults with T1D using MDI therapy. We employ a unique virtual platform(3) to generate over 50,000 glucose observations to train a k-nearest neighbours 4 decision support system (KNN-DSS) to identify causes of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia and determine necessary insulin adjustments from a set of 12 potential recommendations. The KNN-DSS algorithm achieves an overall agreement with board-certified endocrinologists of 67.9% when validated on real-world human data, and delivers safe recommendations, per endocrinologist review. A comparison of inter-physician-recommended adjustments to insulin pump therapy indicates full agreement of 41.2% among endocrinologists, which is consistent with previous measures of inter-physician agreement (41-45%)(3). In silico(3,6) benchmarking using a platform accepted by the United States Food and Drug Administration for evaluation of artificial pancreas technologies indicates substantial improvement in glycaemic outcomes after 12 weeks of KNN-DSS use. Our data indicate that the KNN-DSS allows for early identification of dangerous insulin regimens and may be used to improve glycaemic outcomes and prevent life-threatening complications in people with T1D.;;;;;Tyler, Nichole/0000-0003-3293-9680;;;;;;;;;;;;;2522-5812;;;;JUL;2020;2;7;;;;;612;+;;10.1038/s42255-020-0212-y;;;;;;;WOS:000551962800009;32694787;;;;;

Based on the terminology Industry 4.0, the term describes a revolution in mobility based on the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems. Mobility 4.0 is thus characterized by an autonomous control of processes via artificial intelligence to create an optimum in flexibility and economy with maximum efficiency. The efficiency and sustainability of mobility are optimized and the highest possible individualization and personalization is created through increased networking, data availability and interface creation. This poses new challenges for cities and city tourism destinations in the planning and design of appropriate offers. When analyzing the cities with the largest number of overnight stays in Germany, it becomes clear that the topic - if at all - is dealt with in a rather rudimentary, popular scientific understanding. In comparison to the European Capital of Smart Tourism 2019, Helsinki, the challenges that the examined cities still have before them for successfully integrating a Mobility 4.0 concept into their respective tourism strategy become clear: Above all, those of Helsinki itself considered as the starting point for implementing mobility 4.0, the creation of open data storage as well as the provision of various interfaces has so far been lacking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1867-9501;2366-0406;;;;JUL;2020;12;1;;;;;38;56;;10.1515/tw-2020-0012;;;;;;;WOS:000551542100004;;;;;;

Treatment options addressing COVID-19 included drug repurposing, investigational therapies such as remdesivir, and vaccine development. Combination therapy based on drug repurposing is among the most widely pursued of these efforts. Multi-drug regimens are traditionally designed by selecting drugs based on their mechanism of action. This is followed by dose-finding to achieve drug synergy. This approach is widely-used for drug development and repurposing. Realizing synergistic combinations, however, is a substantially different outcome compared to globally optimizing combination therapy, which realizes the best possible treatment outcome by a set of candidate therapies and doses toward a disease indication. To address this challenge, the results of Project IDentif.AI (Identifying Infectious Disease Combination Therapy with Artificial Intelligence) are reported. An AI-based platform is used to interrogate a massive 12 drug/dose parameter space, rapidly identifying actionable combination therapies that optimally inhibit A549 lung cell infection by vesicular stomatitis virus within three days of project start. Importantly, a sevenfold difference in efficacy is observed between the top-ranked combination being optimally and sub-optimally dosed, demonstrating the critical importance of ideal drug and dose identification. This platform is disease indication and disease mechanism-agnostic, and potentially applicable to the systematic N-of-1 and population-wide design of highly efficacious and tolerable clinical regimens. This work also discusses key factors ranging from healthcare economics to global health policy that may serve to drive the broader deployment of this platform to address COVID-19 and future pandemics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2366-3987;;;;JUL;2020;3;7;;;;;;;2000034;10.1002/adtp.202000034;;;;;;;WOS:000551980200008;32838027;;;;;

This paper first reviews the background of AI and radiotherapy. Then it explores the basic concepts of different AI algorithms and machine learning methods, such as neural networks, that are available to us today and how they are being implemented in radiotherapy and diagnostic processes, such as medical imaging, treatment planning, patient simulation, quality assurance and radiation dose delivery. It also explores the ongoing research on AI methods that are to be implemented in radiotherapy in the future. The review shows very promising progress and future for AI to be widely used in various areas of radiotherapy. However, basing on various concerns such as availability and security of using big data, and further work on polishing and testing AI algorithms, it is found that we may not ready to use AI primarily in radiotherapy at the moment.

In such a scenario, the patentability of new pharmaceutical inventions seems more and more problematic, given that the computational power of AI increases the likelihood that a new chemical composition is deemed to be obvious. In this article I argue that with the advent of AI-generated inventions both EU and US patent law cannot rely exclusively on the traditional standard of the person having ordinary skill in the art to evaluate the non-obviousness condition of patentability. However, I also maintain that a legislative reform is not necessary. Rather, judges should start to more strongly consider the so-called secondary considerations of non-obviousness that have been intermittently and inconsistently applied both in US and EU case law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0018-9855;2195-0237;;;;JUL;2020;51;6;;;;;685;708;;10.1007/s40319-020-00953-8;;;;;;;WOS:000548227600002;;;;;;

This paper evaluates state-of-the-art missing data treatment methods using ML algorithms to classify the performance of technical high school students at the Federal Institute of Goias in Brazil. The aim is to provide an efficient computational tool to aid educational performance that allows the educators to verify the student's tendency to fail.

Unlike in similarly themed modern films, the android is used to explore the creative potential of artificial intelligence, which becomes its similarity to human intelligence. The film establishes a hierarchy of creativity in which the android's ability is much greater than that of the human characters. Through this, it revisits a key idea of earlier female android texts such as Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's novel L'Eve future (1886) and Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927): the knowledge gap stretching between technology developers and users. Ex Machina's exploration of strong artificial intelligence is used also to problematise modern technophilia by reflecting concerns over the exploitation of users' lack of understanding of trusted technologies pervasive in their daily lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1754-3770;1754-3789;;;;JUL;2020;13;2;;;;;223;246;;10.3828/sfftv.2020.12;;;;;;;WOS:000549245500003;;;;;;

Recurrent data trains the algorithms so that they can be adapted to new situations, either to optimize coursework or to manage repetitive tasks. As the algorithms spread in different learning contexts and the actions which they perform expand, pedagogical interpretative frameworks are required to use them properly. Based on case analyses and a literature review, the paper analyses the limits of learning practices based on the massive use of data from a pedagogical approach. The focus is on data capture, biases associated with datasets, and human intervention both in the training of artificial intelligence algorithms and in the design of machine learning pipelines. In order to facilitate the adequate use of data-driven learning practices, it is proposed to frame appropriate heuristics to determine the pedagogical suitability of artificial intelligence systems and also their evaluation both in terms of accountability and of the quality of the teaching-learning process. Thus, finally, a set of top-down proposed rules that can contribute to fill the identified gaps to improve the educational use of data-driven educational algorithms is discussed.;;;;Dominguez Figaredo, Daniel/S-5295-2016;Dominguez Figaredo, Daniel/0000-0002-7772-1856;;;;;;;;;;;;1138-2783;1390-3306;;;;JUL;2020;23;2;;;;;65;84;;10.5944/ried.23.2.26470;;;;;;;WOS:000548767700004;;;;;;

The algorithm is called imitation learning (IL) twin delay deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) (TD3). It combines IL with DDPG (TD3). In order to accelerate the training process of reinforcement learning, the supervised learning method is used in IL for behaviour cloning from the closed-loop control data. The deep reinforcement learning employs actor-critic architecture. The actor part executes the control strategy and the critic part evaluates current control strategy. The training efficiency of IL-TD3 is compared with DDPG and TD3. The simulation results show that the training results of IL-TD3 converge faster and the training process is more stable than both of them, the convergence rate of IL-TD3 algorithm during training is about double that of DDPG and TD3. The control performance via IL-TD3 is superior to PID in UUVs motion control tasks. The average track error of IL-TD3 is reduced by$70\percnt $70%than PID control.

Most existing methods label vehicle behaviours with discrete labels and then use the vehicle trajectories or motion characteristics to train classifiers which identify vehicle behaviours. However, a simple discrete label cannot contain detailed information about the vehicle behaviour. So, inspired by structured learning, the authors design a structured label which is used to characterise the instantaneous behavioural state based on the vehicle image, including behaviour trend and degree simultaneously. A structured convolutional neural networks model is constructed to learn and predict structured representation of transient vehicle behaviour and preliminary experimental results justify the feasibility of vehicle behaviour structural analysis model, but it achieves only 53.3% prediction accuracy. To reduce the risk of overfitting to small-scale training data, the authors further propose an overfitting-preventing deep neural network, which exploits transfer learning and multi-task learning to achieve a much higher prediction accuracy of 91.1%.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1751-956X;1751-9578;;;;JUL;2020;14;7;;;;;792;801;;10.1049/iet-its.2019.0419;;;;;;;WOS:000545971300018;;;;;;

Eisenberg Patient Safety and Quality Awards: A Model Cell for Transformational Redesign of Sepsis Identification and Treatment: Aligning Digital Tools with Innovative Workflows;JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY;;;;;;;;;;;;Background: Readmission after hospitalization, increased morbidity, and high levels of mortality are not uncommon in patients diagnosed with sepsis. Sepsis bundles designed to mitigate the deleterious effects have been recommended for nearly a decade. Despite this, mortality remains high, sepsis bundle requirements controversial, and bundle compliance low. Methods: A health system implemented a multidisciplinary project to decrease the mortality rate of sepsis. A Model Cell mental model was adopted. Data on mortality and compliance were gathered from four acute care hospitals in the system and analyzed. The observed mortality data were compared to predictive data based on comparable acute care facilities. Results: Regression analysis showed significant increases in bundle compliance rates at each site (p < 0.05), reflecting the continuous use of the methods described above. Mortality systemwide decreased significantly in response to increased bundle compliance (r = 0.80, r(2) = 0.64, p < 0.001), with compliance alone accounting for nearly two thirds of the variance in the linear model. The observed results revealed a median mortality rate of 5.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.1%-7.3%, n = 23), 1.9 percentage points lower than predicted when compared to similar institutions. When using only the final 12 months of the project, the median mortality drops further to 5.3% (95% CI = 3.9%-5.6%, n = 12), 2.5 percentage points less than predicted. Conclusion: The Model Cell intervention was successful in increasing bundle compliance, which then decreased mortality. This model can be enhanced as technology improves and is well positioned for artificial intelligence to help drive further success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1553-7250;1938-131X;;;;JUL;2020;46;7;;;;;392;399;;10.1016/j.jcjq.2020.04.001;;;;;;;WOS:000546793100003;32598282;;;;;

The dilemma, however, seems to be that since the new technologies, such artificial intelligence is much more overwhelming phenomenon than e-governance and presumably, before deciding the legal standards, the political and economic strategies that go beyond the e-governance should be set.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00146-020-01009-8;;JUL 2020;;;;;WOS:000545763700001;;;;;;

Actual ED problem is non-convex in nature due to Ramp Rate Limits (RRL), Valve-Point Loading Effects (VPLE), and Prohibited Operating Zones (POZs). It is generally converted into a convex problem as mathematical programming based approaches cannot handle the non-convex cost functions except dynamic programming, which also suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Heuristic techniques are potential solution methodologies for solving the non-convex ED problem. Artificial Algae Algorithm (AAA), a recent meta-heuristic optimization approach showed remarkable results on certain MATLAB benchmark functions but its application on industrial problem such as ED is yet to be explored. In this paper, AAA is used to investigate convex and non-convex ED problem due to valve-point effects and POZs while considering the transmission losses. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach are validated by implementing it on IEEE standard test systems (3, 6, 13 and 40 unit Test Systems), which are widely addressed in the literature. The simulation results are promising when compared with other well-known evolutionary algorithms, showing the potential and stability of this algorithm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0254-7821;2413-7219;;;;JUL;2020;39;3;;;;;564;582;;10.22581/muet1982.2003.12;;;;;;;WOS:000546283500012;;;;;;

In this media transformation, artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced, adapted to social networks for various purposes, including political ones. This work focuses on AI in bot format as an automated tool to publish content on Twitter and on the skills needed to identify them. Bots seek to imitate human behaviour to create a climate of concrete opinion, participate in political conversations and interact with real accounts in order to boycott them or increase their relevance. In order to know the level of media literacy of journalism students and increase their skills to identify this type of manipulation of the public sphere, a teaching intervention is designed at university level, applied to a sample of 55 students, consisting of a workshop to identify bots on Twitter. From the results of the workshop, evaluated through questionnaires, it is observed that the students have previous skills acquired informally to detect bots and that after the workshop the ability to identify these accounts slightly increases and, above all, they manifest a more conscious process when they face them. This paper presents the design of the workshop and its evaluation.;;;;Calvo, Dafne/Y-8463-2018;Calvo, Dafne/0000-0003-0659-6792;;;;;;;;;;;;1697-8293;;;;;JUL-DEC;2020;18;2;;;;;111;136;;10.7195/ri14.v18i1.1515;;;;;;;WOS:000546431900006;;;;;;

Disease prevention is a critical component to curb the morbidity and mortality due to CVD worldwide, and advances in digital health technologies may facilitate adherence to and effectiveness of preventive measures. In this review, we seek to identify and describe recent developments in the use of digital health for CVD prevention between 2015 and 2019. Recent Findings Promising digital health technologies have emerged in the field of cardiology. In the diagnostics arena, AliveCor has shown to obtain real-time electrocardiograms via smartphones, whereas the Apple Watch proved efficacious to detect atrial fibrillation. In the treatment arena, the Corrie Health Digital Platform may enable myocardial infarction patients to benefit from remote cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention. Emerging technologies such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and machine learning suggest further potential for the growth and clinical relevance of digital cardiology. Digital health technologies have become increasingly popular in the repertoire to prevent CVD. Although caution is warranted given the concurrent surge of unregulated smartphone applications and other technologies, digital cardiology presents important potential to reduce the global burden of CVD.;;;;Vervoort, Dominique/AAV-1499-2020;Vervoort, Dominique/0000-0002-3142-0388;;;;;;;;;;;;1932-9520;1932-9563;;;;JUL 1;2020;14;8;;;;;;;10;10.1007/s12170-020-00644-6;;;;;;;WOS:000544656600001;;;;;;

Developing an effective classification rule induction (CRI) framework for bankruptcy prediction and credit risk analysis in appropriate time is essential to prevent the business communities from being bankrupt. Traditional statistical methods and artificial intelligence techniques play a major role to predict bankruptcy and credit risks. Most of the earlier research works were carried out on quantitative methods, while few studies have proposed on qualitative methods to improvise the performance of bankruptcy prediction models. The discovery of bankruptcy prediction in a qualitative way is an important task because it depends on the subjective knowledge of the experts. In this paper, a unified framework for qualitative and quantitative bankruptcy analysis using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based ant-miner algorithm is proposed. Three different natured datasets are used to present a trustworthy result. For this experiment, we have collected qualitative_bankruptcy dataset and benchmarked by UCI repository. The proposed method is successfully applied and the performance analysis prove that ant-miner method is better than existing classifiers namely Logistic Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) in terms of various performance analysis factors. Furthermore, the proposed ant-miner model is found to be a more suitable method for bankruptcy prediction when compared to other traditional statistical and artificial intelligence techniques.

Glenn; Evgeniou, Theodoros; Gerke, Sara; Minssen, Timo";;;The European artificial intelligence strategy: implications and challenges for digital health;LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH;;;;;;;;;;;;In February, 2020, the European Commission published a white paper on artificial intelligence (AI) as well as an accompanying communication and report. The paper sets out policy options to facilitate a secure and trustworthy development of AI and considers health to be one of its most important areas of application. We illustrate that the European Commission's approach, as applied to medical AI, presents some challenges that can be detrimental if not addressed. In particular, we discuss the issues of European values and European data, the update problem of AI systems, and the challenges of new trade-offs such as privacy, cybersecurity, accuracy, and intellectual property rights. We also outline what we view as the most important next steps in the Commission's iterative process. Although the European Commission has done good work in setting out a European approach for AI, we conclude that this approach will be more difficult to implement in health care. It will require careful balancing of core values, detailed consideration of nuances of health and AI technologies, and a keen eye on the political winds and global competition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2589-7500;;;;JUL;2020;2;7;;;;;E376;E379;;;;;;;;;WOS:000544134300013;;;;;;

We aimed to establish whether a deep learning algorithm (DLA) that enables non-invasive anaemia screening from electrocardiograms (ECGs) might improve the detection of anaemia. Methods We did a retrospective, multicentre, diagnostic study in which a DLA was developed using ECGs and then internally and externally validated. We used data from two hospitals, Sejong General Hospital (hospital A) and Mediplex Sejong Hospital (hospital B), in South Korea. Data from hospital A was for DLA development and internal validation, and data from hospital B was for external validation. We included individuals who had at least one ECG with a haemoglobin measurement within 1 h of the index ECG and excluded individuals with missing demographic, electrocardiographic, or haemoglobin information. Three types of DLA were developed with 12-lead, 6-lead (limb lead), and single-lead (lead I) ECGs to detect haemoglobin concentrations of 10 g/dL or less. The DLA was built by a convolutional neural network and used 500-Hz raw ECG, age, and sex as input data. Findings The study period ran from Oct 1, 2016, to Sept 30, 2019, in hospital A and March 1, 2017, to Sept 30, 2019, in hospital B. 40 513 patients at hospital A and 4737 patients at hospital B were eligible for inclusion. We excluded 281 patients at hospital A and 72 patients at hospital B because of missing values for clinical information and ECG data. The development dataset comprised 57 435 ECGs from 31 898 patients, and the algorithm was internally validated with 7974 ECGs from 7974 patients. The external validation dataset included 4665 ECGs from 4665 patients. 586 (internal) and 194 (external) patients within the combined dataset were found to be anaemic. During internal and external validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of the DLA using a 12-lead ECG for detecting anaemia was 0 center dot 923 for internal validation and 0 center dot 901 for external validation. Using a 90% sensitivity operating point for the development data, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of internal validation were 89 center dot 8%, 81 center dot 5%, 99 center dot 4%, and 20 center dot 0%, respectively, and those of external validation were 86 center dot 1%, 76 center dot 2%, 99 center dot 2%, and 13 center dot 5%, respectively. The DLA focused on the QRS complex for deciding the presence of anaemia in a sensitivity map. The AUROCs of DLAs using 6 leads and a single lead were in the range of 0 center dot 841-0 center dot 890. Interpretation In this study, using raw ECG data, a DLA accurately detected anaemia. The application of artificial intelligence to ECGs could enable screening for anaemia. Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Detection comprises the identification and localization of relevant polyps and adenomas and, ideally, the reliable differentiation of the detected lesion (benign, malignant, irrelevant) in order to immediately perform treatment-usually the endoscopic resection of the lesion, directly during the examination and with high diagnostic certainty. Endoscopic imaging has achieved a quantum leap in this field, not least due to the development of high-definition (HD) endoscopes and 4K camera systems, as well as chromoendoscopy in recent decades. Currently, the new modality of deep learning and artificial intelligence is also enriching the field. Therapeutically, there are now possibilities for the safe endoscopic resection of polyps and adenomas of any size and configuration using a number of techniques of varying invasiveness. However, in addition to the procedure's morbidity and complication rate, patient prognosis is always the decisive factor when selecting this treatment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1861-9681;1861-969X;;;;JUL;2020;15;4;;;SI;;282;289;;10.1007/s11377-020-00456-5;;;;;;;WOS:000543463500004;;;;;;

To this end we draw on dialectics and Bayesian accounts of cognition. The former allows us to holistically consider the 'self' as the interplay between internalization and externalization and the latter to operationalize our suggestion formally. Internalization is considered here as the co-construction of bodily hierarchical models of the (social) world and the organism, while externalization is taken as the collective transformation of the world. We do not consider these processes as sequentially linked, but rather as a dialectic between the collective and the individual. This leads us to the suggestion of the self as a historical product of dialectical attunement across multiple time scales, from species evolution and culture to individual development and everyday learning. Subsequently, we describe concrete means for empirically testing our proposal in the form of two-person psychophysiology and multi-level analyses of intersubjectivity. Taken together, we suggest that a fine-grained analysis of social interaction might allow us to reconsider the 'self' beyond the static individual, i.e. how it emerges and manifests itself in social relations. Such an approach, we believe, could be relevant in multiple fields, from ethics and psychiatry to pedagogy and artificial intelligence.;;;;Schilbach, Leonhard/G-5832-2010;Schilbach, Leonhard/0000-0001-5547-8309;;;;;;;;;;;;0167-7411;1572-8749;;;;JUL;2020;39;3;;;SI;;521;534;;10.1007/s11245-018-9574-0;;;;;;;WOS:000538360100003;;;;;;

The combination of cloud computing, along with the E-learning, has emerged recently as a novel technique for managing and delivering the E-learning services. Sharing of data in between the cloud storage and the E-learning platform is mandatory in order to make sure that the user's needs are satisfied and also to enhance the standard of the services provided by this learning platform. Though, various researches have been done in the past for improving the security and privacy of this cloud-based Learning method, and complete accuracy is not achieved. In this paper, a novel framework for providing the security and privacy of the cloud-based E-learning platform is provided. The main objective of this work is to use intelligent agent-based systems for providing data security and privacy. The aim of our work is to identify an architecture that will be using Cloud Computing within higher education. The proposed framework comprises of various agents such as the user interface agent and the authentication agent with intelligent and distinct working features. These agents make effective communication between users, E-service providers, and the cloud-based system. This system monitors the data flow between the user, the E-learning platform, and the cloud-based systems focus on various security and privacy concerns that the E-healthcare environment is facing.

They use various methods of artificial intelligence, in particular methods from the group of soft computing. In this paper, we focus on on-line signature verification. Such signatures are complex objects described not only by the shape but also by the dynamics of the signing process. In standard devices used for signature acquisition (with an LCD touch screen) this dynamics may include pen velocity, but sometimes other types of signals are also available, e.g. pen pressure on the screen surface (e.g. in graphic tablets), the angle between the pen and the screen surface, etc. The precision of the on-line signature dynamics processing has been a motivational springboard for developing methods that use signature partitioning. Partitioning uses a well-known principle of decomposing the problem into smaller ones. In this paper, we propose a new partitioning algorithm that uses capabilities of the algorithms based on populations and fuzzy systems. Evolutionary-fuzzy partitioning eliminates the need to average dynamic waveforms in created partitions because it replaces them. Evolutionary separation of partitions results in a better matching of partitions with reference signatures, eliminates disproportions between the number of points describing dynamics in partitions, eliminates the impact of random values, separates partitions related to the signing stage and its dynamics (e.g. high and low velocity of signing, where high and low are imprecise-fuzzy concepts). The operation of the presented algorithm has been tested using the well-known BioSecure DS2 database of real dynamic signatures.;;;;;Przybyszewski, Krzysztof/0000-0002-7694-365X;;;;;;;;;;;;2083-2567;2449-6499;;;;JUL;2020;10;3;;;;;173;187;;10.2478/jaiscr-2020-0012;;;;;;;WOS:000536725600002;;;;;;

In Taiwan, open contractors conduct inspections of roads and ancillary facilities daily or weekly according to the requirements of the agency awarding the contracts. Unfortunately, the equipment used for inspections the inspection data lacks follow-up applications and numerical conversions, such as the Pavement Condition Index (PCI), to compile a large-scale database to facilitate the long-term conservation of roads. In this study, this paper developed back-end image recognition software using existing road inspection methods and existing equipment. This was aimed at enhancing inspection efficiency by enabling the automatic identification of road damage. Resulting observations can then be converted into PCI values in accordance with ASTM D6433-16 to be exported as a numeric value indicative of road quality. A vehicle-mounted traffic recorder and imaging device with Wi-Fi transmission capability are used as hardware, and the relationship between the captured images and the speed of the car is used to obtain an accurate indication of road conditions across the surface. The simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) Superpixels algorithm is used to identify areas with pavement damage as patches, potholes, longitudinal cracking, and crocodile cracking. The results of the proposed fully-automated method conform strongly with those obtained using semi-automated pavement inspection software. Despite the restrictions imposed by the limited depth measurement of 2D images, our method achieved results close to those obtained using manual inspection. Future developments will include the application of artificial intelligence to enhance the effectiveness of this software.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2186-2982;2186-2990;;;;JUL;2020;19;71;;;;;242;249;;10.21660/2020.71.96640;;;;;;;WOS:000521935900034;;;;;;

Recent studies about artificial intelligence (AI) or computer aided diagnosis (CAD) are also increasingly reported. We investigate the current application of endocytoscopy, as well as the benefit of AI and CAD. Furthermore, we performed a meta-analysis comparing the diagnostic performance of endocytoscopy and magnified chromoendoscopy. In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis supports the recent finding indicating the higher diagnostic performance of endocytoscope in the depth assessment of colorectal neoplasms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2415-1289;;;;JUL;2020;5;;;;;;;;40;10.21037/tgh.2019.12.04;;;;;;;WOS:000514854600009;32632391;;;;;

Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast develop a malignant tumor. Detecting BC at an early stage with state-of-the-art technologies helps in treating BC and reduces the risk of death. Currently, mammography is the most commonly used technique for detecting BC. In order to improve the mammogram analysis, researchers have studied the feasibility of using artificial intelligence to help doctors in detecting any changes that may lead to cancer. This review paper investigates utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms for BC prediction and classification, which will be beneficial in early diagnosis and treatment for BC and for future researchers in exploring the different ML techniques and selecting the most suitable one for their future research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1738-7906;;;;;JUN 30;2020;20;6;;;;;83;90;;;;;;;;;WOS:000577880100009;;;;;;
J;Al Janabi, MAM;;;;Al Janabi, Mazin A. M.;;;Multivariate portfolio optimization under illiquid market prospects: a review of theoretical algorithms and practical techniques for liquidity risk management;JOURNAL OF MODELLING IN MANAGEMENT;;;;;;;;;;;;Purpose This study aims to examine the theoretical foundations for multivariate portfolio optimization algorithms under illiquid market conditions. In this study, special emphasis is devoted to the application of a risk-engine, which is based on the contemporary concept of liquidity-adjusted value-at-risk (LVaR), to multivariate optimization of investment portfolios. Design/methodology/approach This paper examines the modeling parameters of LVaR technique under event market settings and discusses how to integrate asset liquidity risk into LVaR models. Finally, the authors discuss scenario optimization algorithms for the assessment of structured investment portfolios and present a detailed operational methodology for computer programming purposes and prospective research design with the backing of a graphical flowchart. Findings To that end, the portfolio/risk manager can specify different closeout horizons and dependence measures and calculate the necessary LVaR and resulting investable portfolios. In addition, portfolio managers can compare the return/risk ratio and asset allocation of obtained investable portfolios with different liquidation horizons in relation to the conventional Markowitz ' s mean-variance approach. Practical implications The examined optimization algorithms and modeling techniques have important practical applications for portfolio management and risk assessment, and can have many uses within machine learning and artificial intelligence, expert systems and smart financial applications, financial technology (FinTech), and within big data environments. In addition, it provide key real-world implications for portfolio/risk managers, treasury directors, risk management executives, policymakers and financial regulators to comply with the requirements of Basel III best practices on liquidly risk. Originality/value The proposed optimization algorithms can aid in advancing portfolios selection and management in financial markets by assessing investable portfolios subject to meaningful operational and financial constraints. Furthermore, the robust risk-algorithms and portfolio optimization techniques can aid in solving some real-world dilemmas under stressed and adverse market conditions, such as the effect of liquidity when it dries up in financial and commodity markets, the impact of correlations factors when there is a switching in their signs and the integration of the influence of the nonlinear and non-normal distribution of assets' returns in portfolio optimization and management.;;;;Janabi, Mazin A.

Jamiur; Javed, Faheem; Hamid, Pousettef";;;Artificial Intelligence: Is It Armageddon for Breast Radiologists?;CUREUS;;;;;;;;;;;;Artificial Intelligence (AI) has taken radiology by storm, in particular, mammogram interpretation, and we have seen a recent surge in the number of publications on potential uses of AI in breast radiology. Breast cancer exerts a lot of burden on the National Health Service (NHS) and is the second most common cancer in the UK as of 2018. New cases of breast cancer have been on the rise in the past decade, while the survival rate has been improving. The NHS breast cancer screening program led to an improvement in survival rate. The expansion of the screening program led to more mammograms, thereby putting more work on the hands of radiologists, and the issue of double reading further worsens the workload. The introduction of computer-aided detection (CAD) systems to help radiologists was found not to have the expected outcome of improving the performance of readers. Unreliability of CAD systems has led to the explosion of studies and development of applications with the potential use in breast imaging. The purported success recorded with the use of machine learning in breast radiology has led to people postulating ideas that AI will replace breast radiologists. Of course, AI has many applications and potential uses in radiology, but will it replace radiologists? We reviewed many articles on the use of AI in breast radiology to give future radiologists and radiologists full information on this topic. This article focuses on explaining the basic principles and terminology of AI in radiology, potential uses, and limitations of AI in radiology. We have also analysed articles and answered the question of whether AI will replace radiologists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2168-8184;;;;JUN 30;2020;12;6;;;;;;;e8923;10.7759/cureus.8923;;;;;;;WOS:000544581700006;32760624;;;;;
J;du Boulay, B;;;;du Boulay, Benedict;;;Jim Greer's and Mary Mark's Reviews of Evaluation Methods for Adaptive Systems: a Brief Comment about New Goals;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION;;;;;;;;;;;;Mark and Greer's (International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 4(2/3), 129-153,1993) review was very influential in setting out effective goals and methods for evaluating adaptive educational systems of all kinds. A later review brought the story up to date (Greer,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 26(1), 387-392,2016). The current paper explores a new range of evaluative goals which go beyond the quality of learning outcomes, learning efficiency, transfer, retention, and short-term motivation. While learner satisfaction has been downgraded over the years as a reliable indicator of learning quality, it cannot be wholly ignored in terms of wider issues such as the learner's developing metacognitive and meta-affective insight, regulatory competence and longer-term motivation. These factors lead on to such evaluable issues as the learner's appetite for further learning of the kind just experienced as well as for learning in general. The rise in the use of data analytics and the increasing use of AIED and computer-based learning systems in schools and universities has led to the development of orchestration systems to assist the teacher to manage their students using such systems. Orchestration systems raise new kinds of evaluation goal, such as the balance of activity, cooperation and agency between the human teacher and the adaptive systems, as well as between the learner, the systems, the teacher and, indeed, other learners. Further evaluable goals include the degree to which the teacher is alerted to the learning difficulties of the learners, the degree to which the teacher's scarce and valuable time is being used efficiently, and the degree to which the orchestration system can be used as a reflective device for teachers to examine their own practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1560-4292;1560-4306;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s40593-020-00198-z;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000544528700001;;;;;;

An uncertainty arises with the crisis of values that can support the human in the age of artificial intelligence. Should we seek contemporary access points to the archaic origins of the species? Or must we also imagine new Anthropocenic-Axial values to reground the human event? In his most recent work, Habermas affirms the continuing importance of the contemporary access to the First Axial values, but before him Jaspers anticipates that a second cognitive revolution opens areas that may be receptive to new value foundations.

J;Segun, ST;;;;Segun, Samuel T.;;;From machine ethics to computational ethics;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;"Research into the ethics of artificial intelligence is often categorized into two subareas-robot ethics and machine ethics. Many of the definitions and classifications of the subject matter of these subfields, as found in the literature, are conflated, which I seek to rectify. In this essay, I infer that using the term 'machine ethics' is too broad and glosses over issues that the term computational ethics best describes. I show that the subject of inquiry of computational ethics is of great value and indeed is an important frontier in developing ethical artificial intelligence systems (AIS). I also show that computational is a distinct, often neglected field in the ethics of AI. In contrast to much of the literature, I argue that the appellation 'machine ethics' does not sufficiently capture the entire project of embedding ethics into AI/S, and hence the need for computational ethics. This essay is unique for two reasons; first, it offers a philosophical analysis of the subject of computational ethics that is not found in the literature. Second, it offers a finely grained analysis that shows the thematic distinction among robot ethics, machine ethics and computational ethics.";;;;;Segun, Samuel T./0000-0002-1017-0906;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00146-020-01010-1;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000544881300001;;;;;;

J;"Ermias, B; Vishal, V";;;;"Ermias, Birhanu; Vishal, Vikram";;;Application of Artificial Intelligence for Prediction of Swelling Potential of Clay-Rich Soils;GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING;;;;;;;;;;;;Susceptibility of fine grained soils to swelling and shrinkage problems is crucial for safe design of infrastructure, construction and maintenance. However, quantification of soil response and measurement of their geotechnical properties is time taking, expensive and involves destructive tests. Therefore, dependable forecasting models are necessary that calculate swell percentage from results of quick, inexpensive and non-destructive tests. In this paper, a three-layer feedforward neural network (ANN-TFN) was applied in order to envisage swell percentage of fine grained soils and the results were compared with that of multiple regression (MR). The parameters considered as input were activity, clay, liquid limit, plastic limit, plasticity index and fines while swell percentage was used as output. The best ANN-TFN model demonstrated root mean square errors (RMSE) of 1.529, sum of squares errors (SSE) of 369.3, and coefficient of correlation (R-2) of 0.80. MR model displayed 1.756 (RMSE), 487.2 (SSE), and 0.508 (R-2). The maximum R(2)values obtained by simple regression was 0.5. Overall, the established three-layer feedforward neural network models (ANN-TFN 1-6) showed significantly higher prediction performances than either multiple regression or simple regression models. Moreover, the use of Levenberg-Marquardt as training parameter and tan sigmoid as transfer function were noted to be more appropriate for good prediction performance in this problem. Hence, the result of the present study concludes that practice of the ANN-TFN model to determine swell percentage of fine grained soil is a promising approach for increasing the confidence of making accurate decisions during the soil engineering works.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0960-3182;1573-1529;;;;DEC;2020;38;6;;;;;6189;6205;;10.1007/s10706-020-01427-x;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000543946300001;;;;;;

L.; Svalbe, Imants";;;Magnetic resonance fingerprinting: from evolution to clinical applications;JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RADIATION SCIENCES;;;;;;;;;;;;"In 2013, Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) emerged as a method for fast, quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging. This paper reviews the current status of MRF up to early 2020 and aims to highlight the advantages MRF can offer medical imaging professionals. By acquiring scan data as pseudorandom samples, MRF elicits a unique signal evolution, or 'fingerprint', from each tissue type. It matches 'randomised' free induction decay acquisitions against pre-computed simulated tissue responses to generate a set of quantitative images of T-1, T(2)and proton density (PD) with co-registered voxels, rather than as traditional relative T-1- and T-2-weighted images. MRF numeric pixel values retain accuracy and reproducibility between 2% and 8%. MRF acquisition is robust to strong undersampling of k-space. Scan sequences have been optimised to suppress sub-sampling artefacts, while artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have been employed to increase matching speed and precision. MRF promises improved patient comfort with reduced scan times and fewer image artefacts. Quantitative MRF data could be used to define population-wide numeric biomarkers that classify normal versus diseased tissue. Certification of clinical centres for MRF scan repeatability would permit numeric comparison of sequential images for any individual patient and the pooling of multiple patient images across large, cross-site imaging studies. MRF has to date shown promising results in early clinical trials, demonstrating reliable differentiation between malignant and benign prostate conditions, and normal and sclerotic hippocampal tissue. MRF is now undergoing small-scale trials at several sites across the world; moving it closer to routine clinical application.";;;;;Hsieh, Jean JL/0000-0002-5807-3777;;;;;;;;;;;;2051-3895;2051-3909;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1002/jmrs.413;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000543683200001;32596957;;;;;

Design/methodology/approach The method used is critical text analysis and policy analysis, providing background and relevant factors leading up to the legislative changes under review. Extensive literature sources were consulted and the relevant sections of the Jamaican constitution referenced and analysed. Findings The case study may have national peculiarities not applicable in other jurisdictions. Its introduction acknowledges that the Jamaican Government may amend and re-submit the legislation, absent the flawed clauses. The paper however will remain valid given its detailed analysis and exposure of risks associated with biometric data collection, face recognition technology and data storage flaws. Practical implications It will be a practical example of the risks associated with flawed biometric data collection and the role of Courts in reviewing such legislation. Referrals to the Courts can be used as a remedy, as occurred not only in Jamaica but also in many other jurisdictions, including India and Kenya. Social implications The paper foregrounds the rights of citizens to be consulted on the collection and storage of their sensitive biometric data. The social implications and risks of violating the constitutional rights of citizens were made evident, and can be an example to other jurisdictions. Originality/value The paper is the first of its kind to provide detailed data and analysis on an outright rejection by the Courts of a country's ID legislation on grounds that it violated the constitution and rights of citizens.

Following Aby Warburg's 'space of thought' (1929), they define the thinking space of interactive media art as a 'space filled with data' (Strauss, W., and M. Fleischmann. 2001. Imagine Space Fused with Data. In: CAST 2001. Living in Mixed Realities, Fraunhofer IMK. Proceedings p. 41-45.).

Developments by the author in making various generative digital abstract, or concrete, works are described and compared to film. The generation of the time element of the works described is integral with the generation of images. It is shown how different approaches to dealing with time in the digital context have emerged. In particular, an integrated constructivist approach has built from concepts in abstract film to go beyond cinema in a way that makes significant use of digital media. It has been possible to develop these works into interactive pieces by using artificial intelligent methods in various ways. True to the spirit of the early work described, these interactive works are also concrete rather than virtual.

This study examines the potential of applying advanced artificial intelligence methods to the educational problem of assessing text difficulty. The combination of hierarchical machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) is leveraged to predict the difficulty of practice texts used in a reading comprehension intelligent tutoring system, iSTART. Human raters estimated the text difficulty level of 262 texts across two text sets (Set A and Set B) in the iSTART library. NLP tools were used to identify linguistic features predictive of text difficulty and these indices were submitted to both flat and hierarchical machine learning algorithms. Results indicated that including NLP indices and machine learning increased accuracy by more than 10% as compared to classic readability metrics (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level). Further, hierarchical outperformed non-hierarchical (flat) machine learning classification for Set B (72%) and the combined set A + B (65%), whereas the non-hierarchical approach performed slightly better than the hierarchical approach for Set A (79%). These findings demonstrate the importance of considering deeper features of language related to text difficulty as well as the potential utility of hierarchical machine learning approaches in the development of meaningful text difficulty classification.;;;;;, Renu/0000-0003-1393-2416;;;;;;;;;;;;1560-4292;1560-4306;;;;OCT;2020;30;3;;;;;337;370;;10.1007/s40593-020-00201-7;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000543314000001;;;;;;

Despite the increased investments in research infrastructure by pharmaceutical companies and technological advances in the scientific tools available, efforts to increase the number of molecules coming through the drug development pipeline have largely been unfruitful. Main body A non-systematic review of the current literature was undertaken to enumerate the various strategies employed to improve the success rates in the pharmaceutical research and development. The review covers the exploitation of genomics and proteomics, complementarity of target-based and phenotypic efficacy screening platforms, drug repurposing and repositioning, collaborative research, focusing on underserved therapeutic fields, outsourcing strategy, and pharmaceutical modeling and artificial intelligence. Examples of successful drug discoveries achieved through application of these strategies are highlighted and discussed herein. Conclusions Genomics and proteomics have uncovered a wide array of potential drug targets and are facilitative of enhanced scrupulous target identification and validation thus reducing efficacy-related drug attrition. When used complementarily, phenotypic and target-based screening platforms would likely allow serendipitous drug discovery while increasing rationality in drug design. Drug repurposing and repositioning reduces financial risks in drug development accompanied by cost and time savings, while prolonging patent exclusivity hence increased returns on investment to the innovator company. Equally important, collaborative research is facilitative of cross-fertilization and refinement of ideas, while sharing resources and expertise, hence reducing overhead costs in the early stages of drug discovery. Underserved therapeutic fields are niche drug discovery areas that may be used to experiment and launch novel drug targets, while exploiting incentivized benefits afforded by drug regulatory authorities. Outsourcing allows the pharma industries to focus on their core competencies while deriving greater efficiency of specialist contract research organizations. The existing and emerging pharmaceutical modeling and artificial intelligence softwares and tools allow for in silico computation enabling more efficient computer-aided drug design. Careful selection and application of these strategies, singly or in combination, may potentially harness pharmaceutical research and innovation.;;;;;"Njogu, Peter/0000-0001-6321-1022; Kiriiri, Geoffrey/0000-0001-9814-2258";;;;;;;;;;;;2314-7245;2314-7253;;;;JUN 23;2020;6;1;;;;;;;UNSP 27;10.1186/s43094-020-00047-9;;;;;;;WOS:000544983500002;;;;;;

Despite prolific research in this area, scholarship on the credibility of algorithm-based and automated news has yet to offer empirical findings in regards to the causes and their impacts. In line with prior studies concerning news credibility, this study examines the driving forces in predicting the level of credibility on artificial intelligence (AI) news. Specially, this study unveils the effects of communicative capital, such as media use and public discussion, among audiences, as well as social capital, such as social trust, on AI news credibility. Data collected through a nationwide online survey reveals that media use through television, social network sites, and online news sites, as well as public discussion yielded a positive association with AI news credibility. Of particular interest is that social trust moderated the effect of public discussion on credibility, indicating that the relationship between discussion and credibility was even stronger for those who have a higher level of trust in others.

PBPM systems support process workers and process managers in making operational decisions. State-of-the-art PBPM systems apply deep-learning techniques with multiple hidden layers to infer from data which makes it difficult for system users to understand why a prediction was made. However, the user needs to see deeper causes to identify intervention mechanisms that secure process performance. The main contribution of this paper is a technique that makes a prediction more explainable by visualising how much the different activities included in a process impacted the prediction. This work is the first to use gated graph neural networks (GGNNs) to make decisions more explainable, and it's also GGNN's first application to PBPM.

In particular, general purpose technologies are major drivers of entrepreneurship. Thus, a nuanced understanding on technological knowledge and its spillovers among actors within an EE is warranted. Using knowledge-spillover-based strategic entrepreneurship theory, we propose to observe knowledge spillovers through the assessment of the knowledge bases of a technology in an EE. To do so, this article proposes to use three key sources of knowledge: publications reflecting the emerging knowledge base, patents representing the realized knowledge base, and startups showing the experimental knowledge base. This article uses secondary data sources such as Web of Science and applies the method of bibliometrics to illustrate how an assessment is carried out in practice by evaluating the artificial intelligence (AI) knowledge bases in Sydney from 2000 to 2018. The findings are summarized with an illustration of the evolution of the key actors and their activities over time in order to indicate the key strengths and weaknesses in Sydney's AI knowledge among the different bases. Contrary to expectations from the high potential of knowledge spillovers from a general purpose digital technology such as AI, the article shows that apparent knowledge spillovers are yet highly limited in Sydney. Even though Sydney has a strong emerging knowledge base, the realized knowledge base seems weak and the experimental knowledge base is slowly improving. That observation itself verifies the need to take strategic actions to facilitate knowledge spillovers within EEs. After the implications for theory and policy makers are discussed, suggestions for further studies are proposed.;;;;CETINDAMAR, DILEK/R-9278-2019;"CETINDAMAR, DILEK/0000-0002-0457-3258; Lammers, Thorsten/0000-0003-1000-2395; Zhang, Yi/0000-0002-7731-0301";;;;;;;;;;;;1096-4762;1520-6874;;;;SEP;2020;62;5;;;SI;;457;474;;10.1002/tie.22158;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000541252100001;;;;;;

One of the reasons appears to be the unmatched performance achieved by such systems. This has resulted in an enormous hope on such techniques and often these are viewed as all-cure solutions. But most of these systems cannot explain why a particular decision is made (black box) and sometimes miserably fail in cases where other systems would not. Consequently, in critical applications such as healthcare and defense practitioners do not like to trust such systems. Although an Al system is often designed taking inspiration from the brain, there is not much attempt to exploit cues from the brain in true sense. In our opinion, to realize intelligent systems with human like reasoning ability, we need to exploit knowledge from the brain science. Here we discuss a few findings in brain science that may help designing intelligent systems. We explain the relevance of transparency, explainability, learning from a few examples, and the trustworthiness of an Al system. We also discuss a few ways that may help to achieve these attributes in a learning system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2296-9144;;;;;JUN 19;2020;7;;;;;;;;76;10.3389/frobt.2020.00076;;;;;;;WOS:000548408300001;;;;;;

Where it results in floods that can pose a direct threat, capable of causing human and material losses. Over the past two decades, artificial intelligence has been widely applied in the field of hydrology as well as in many other areas of hydraulic engineering. The wavelet transform is a very popular technique in the analysis of non-stationary time series and particularly effective for hydrological series. Currently, the application of intelligent hybrid systems in different fields has shown good performance and unparalleled efficiency. As such, in this work, we propose a hybrid neuro-fuzzy-wavelet model to modelling the rainfall-runoff transformation for forecasting daily flow rates in the Sebaou basin located in Tizi Ouzou region. The results obtained are very encouraging and better than those obtained by the models used for comparison in this research.

In order to maintain the identity of built heritage and resolve possible deterioration over the years, special expertise is required to avoid possible materials decay and to preserve building elements in a way that allows them to function efficiently as originally intended. Design/methodology/approach An expert system is created to identify the most effective method of repair for each specific building material and to propose the appropriate conservation methods for resolving different types of damages. Artificial intelligence is used to provide a systematic problem-solving technique that saves time and provides the most efficient conservation and preservation method for heritage building elements. Findings Those expert systems could be generalized on similar historical structures to be used as a systematic guide for examining material, evaluating deterioration state and objectively suggesting their related repair techniques. Further deteriorated materials in heritage buildings should be investigated, such as stone and timber staircases, to provide a guide for usage by restoration and conservation authorities. Originality/value Using a user-friendly method, with special considerations to three major problematic building elements in terms of decay and material dysfunction in heritage structures, timber doors, iron gates, and ceiling paintings are selected for diagnosis and repair in an Egyptian heritage building.;;;;;Marzouk, Mohamed/0000-0002-8594-8452;;;;;;;;;;;;2398-4708;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1108/IJBPA-12-2019-0106;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000546979700001;;;;;;

J;Mosakas, K;;;;Mosakas, Kestutis;;;On the moral status of social robots: considering the consciousness criterion;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;While philosophers have been debating for decades on whether different entities-including severely disabled human beings, embryos, animals, objects of nature, and even works of art-can legitimately be considered as having moral status, this question has gained a new dimension in the wake of artificial intelligence (AI). One of the more imminent concerns in the context of AI is that of the moral rights and status of social robots, such as robotic caregivers and artificial companions, that are built to interact with human beings. In recent years, some approaches to moral consideration have been proposed that would include social robots as proper objects of moral concern, even though it seems unlikely that these machines are conscious beings. In the present paper, I argue against these approaches by advocating the consciousness criterion, which proposes phenomenal consciousness as a necessary condition for accrediting moral status. First, I explain why it is generally supposed that consciousness underlies the morally relevant properties (such as sentience) and then, I respond to some of the common objections against this view. Then, I examine three inclusive alternative approaches to moral consideration that could accommodate social robots and point out why they are ultimately implausible. Finally, I conclude that social robots should not be regarded as proper objects of moral concern unless and until they become capable of having conscious experience. While that does not entail that they should be excluded from our moral reasoning and decision-making altogether, it does suggest that humans do not owe direct moral duties to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00146-020-01002-1;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000543548600001;;;;;;

This paper introduces a novel methodology for the development of integrated thermal, power and mobility 5th generation (5G) smart energy networks. The proposed 5G concept builds on state of the art by connecting flexible electricity demands such as heat pumps, and electric vehicles to intermittent, renewable and secondary energy sources and storage using artificial intelligence to facilitate optimal control and to maximise revenue and carbon savings. The proposed innovative method is being applied in central London through the development of two independent 5G smart energy schemes. The proposed schemes will incorporate a range of different renewables and secondary energy sources, for example, waste heat from local data centres and the London Underground that will supply a large proportion of the energy demand of the overall district network capacity. Both networks will operate at close to ambient temperature, approximately 15-25 degrees C as a so-called 'ambient loop' system, with individual heat pumps for each end-user or building connected to the network. The system also integrates thermal and electrical storage to create additional flexibility for the network and smart control for demand-side management. A smart management system flexibly controls individual assets such as heat pumps and electric vehicles in response to price signals reflecting the intermittency of renewable energy sources on the electricity grid. The ambient district thermal loop will distribute low carbon energy to a range of end users. Results presented in this paper provide an understanding of capital costs associated with integrated smart energy systems and the relative performance of individual technologies in a complex system using a techno-economic modelling approach. Overall, this paper demonstrates that the implementation of the 5G concept results in lower energy costs to consumers while at the same time transforming a large existing urban area to a near zero-carbon energy system in terms of heating, cooling, electricity and transport.

Additionally, the use of gated cardiac CT to assess coronary artery calcium (CAC) burden has been validated to determine a patient's risk for major cardiovascular adverse events. This is typically performed by calculating an Agatston score based on density and overall burden of calcified plaque within the coronary arteries. Patients that qualify for LDCT for lung cancer screening commonly share major risk factors for coronary artery disease and would frequently benefit from an additional gated cardiac CT for the assessment of CAC. Given the widespread use of LDCT for lung cancer screening, we evaluated current literature regarding the use of non-gated chest CT, specifically LDCT, for the detection and grading of coronary artery calcifications. Additionally, given the evolving and increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the interpretation of radiologic studies, current literature for the use of AI in CAC assessment was reviewed. We reviewed primary scientific literature dating up to April 2020 using Pubmed and Google Scholar, with the search terms low dose CT, lung cancer screening, coronary artery calcium, EKG/cardiac gated CT, deep learning, machine learning, and AI. These publications were then independently evaluated by each member of our team. Overall, there was a consensus within these papers that LDCT for lung cancer screening plays a role in the evaluation of CAC. Most studies note the inherent problems with the evaluation of the density of coronary calcifications on LDCT to give an accurate numeric calcium or Agatston score. The current method of evaluating CAC on LDCT involves using a qualitative categorical system (none, mild, moderate, or severe). When performed by cardiac imaging experts, this method broadly correlates with traditional CAC score groups (0, 1 to 100, 101 to 400, and > 400). Furthermore, given the high sensitivity of a properly protocolled LDCT for coronary calcium, a negative study for CAC precludes the need for a dedicated gated CT assessment. However, qualitative methods are not as accurate or reproducible when performed by general radiologists. The implementation of AI in the LDCT screening process has the potential to give a quantifiable and reproducible numeric value to the calcium score, based on whole heart volume scoring of calcium. This more closely aligns with the Agatston score and serves as a better guide for treatment and risk assessment using current guidelines. We conclude that CAC should be assessed on all LDCT performed for lung cancer screening and that a qualitative categorical scoring system should be provided in the impression for each patient. Early studies involving AI for the assessment of CAC are promising, but more extensive studies are needed before a final recommendation for its use can be given. The implementation of an accurate, automated AI CAC assessment tool would improve radiologist compliance and ease of overall workflow. Ultimately, the potential end result would be improved turnaround time, better patient outcomes, and reduced healthcare costs by maximizing preventative care in this high-risk population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2168-8184;;;;JUN 12;2020;12;6;;;;;;;e8574;10.7759/cureus.8574;;;;;;;WOS:000540212300004;32670710;;;;;

At present, more and more schools and teachers are trying to use internet teaching mode. With the application of new generation information technology such as big data, Internet of things, mobile Internet and their deep integration with classroom teaching, online teaching has been developing. Online teaching platform is an important teaching medium under the development of information technology. The extensive application of online teaching platform will change the traditional teaching methods and realize a teaching reform combining computer technology and multimedia network technology. In the current situation of information technology, online teaching platform has been applied to all kinds of teaching in universities, primary and secondary schools. Mobile Internet technology will become an important tool for college education and teaching. In this paper, we propose an on-line network teaching platform based on intelligent speech recognition. The recognition tool is applied to validate the speeaker and the sound analysis to guarantee the quality of service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1381-2416;1572-8110;;;;SEP;2020;23;3;;;SI;;489;497;;10.1007/s10772-020-09723-w;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000539857200002;;;;;;

This revolution is reshaping economies, the global landscape and business ecosystems. The 4IR is disrupting the status quo of traditional business operations. Objective: The research objective was to determine how a newly-developed information and knowledge management framework can be used as an enabler for knowledge management (KM) firms to successfully conduct business in the 4IR, further establishing if new innovative services are required for KM firms in the 4IR. Methods: Qualitative research methodology was used to select business cases, and critical case sampling was used for the selection of interviewees. Structured content analysis was conducted on the business cases, and in-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with the interviewees. Results: The result was the development of an information and knowledge management framework that can be used as a new 4IR enabler by KM firms. The research elaborates on a new service offering that was developed specifically for the KM firm, namely Research as a Service. Conclusion: Knowledge management firms need to adapt their existing business frameworks, business models and commercialisation lifecycles, to ensure that the business is prepared for successful business operations in the 4IR.;;;;;de Koker, Lucian/0000-0003-4666-231X;;;;;;;;;;;;2078-1865;1560-683X;;;;JUN 11;2020;22;1;;;;;;;a1178;10.4102/sajim.v22i1.1178;;;;;;;WOS:000546562800001;;;;;;
J;"Chen, Z; He, Y";;;;"Chen, Zheng; He, Yu";;;Imitation or Efficiency? Aesthetics of Artificial Intelligence;FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENCE;;;;;;;;;;;;Artificial intelligence is regarded in the context of the tasks that are delegated to it during the development of technical projects and the features of the implementation of tasks that must be performed in real time without the possibility of interruption. The relevance of the study is determined by the fact that artificial intelligence sees as its main task the formalisation of decision-making with little or no human involvement. The basis of the methodological search are biological and prognostic methods. The current stage of development of socio-humanitarian technologies, and in particular, systems with artificial intelligence, prompts people to conduct such socio-technical projects, for the implementation of which the properties of the human biological brain are no longer enough. The result of research on artificial intelligence is the desire to understand the work of the human brain, to reveal the secrets of human consciousness and the problem of creating machines with a certain level of human intelligence. The novelty of the study is determined by the fact that the understanding of artificial intelligence is primarily aimed at creating an environment that can distinguish artificial intelligence from the entire array of technological devices not only as a platform of knowledge and program code. The practical significance of the study is determined by the necessity for standardisation and the formation of attitudes and the acceptability of the use of artificial intelligence in tasks that will subsequently affect social development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1233-1821;1572-8471;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s10699-020-09682-0;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000539908400001;;;;;;

In order to reduce the labor intensity and environmental impact of the monitoring personnel and improve the speed and efficiency of the wind energy censuses, and reduce the cost of wind energy censuses, an intelligent wireless wind energy monitor with the speech analytic framework is designed, which is a convenient solution to these difficulties. In the speech recognition section, we have two major novelties. (1) In order to ensure the accuracy of substitution, this paper uses phonemes as the basic unit for the substitution of domain words. (2) The Euclidean distance in the feature space is equivalent to the cosine distance. In the test phase, complex similarity can be directly used to calculate scores. We use the Labview to implement the system, and the robustness test is done. The expeirment setting is based on the latest methodology. Through the experiment, after comparing with modern state-of-the-art methodologies, the performance of the proposed model is verified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1381-2416;1572-8110;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s10772-020-09719-6;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000539531800001;;;;;;
J;"Ryan, M; Stahl, BC";;;;"Ryan, Mark; Stahl, Bernd Carsten";;;Artificial intelligence ethics guidelines for developers and users: clarifying their content and normative implications;JOURNAL OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & ETHICS IN SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;Purpose The purpose of this paper is clearly illustrate this convergence and the prescriptive recommendations that such documents entail. There is a significant amount of research into the ethical consequences of artificial intelligence (AI). This is reflected by many outputs across academia, policy and the media. Many of these outputs aim to provide guidance to particular stakeholder groups. It has recently been shown that there is a large degree of convergence in terms of the principles upon which these guidance documents are based. Despite this convergence, it is not always clear how these principles are to be translated into practice. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the authors move beyond the high-level ethical principles that are common across the AI ethics guidance literature and provide a description of the normative content that is covered by these principles. The outcome is a comprehensive compilation of normative requirements arising from existing guidance documents. This is not only required for a deeper theoretical understanding of AI ethics discussions but also for the creation of practical and implementable guidance for developers and users of AI. Findings In this paper, the authors therefore provide a detailed explanation of the normative implications of existing AI ethics guidelines but directed towards developers and organisational users of AI. The authors believe that the paper provides the most comprehensive account of ethical requirements in AI currently available, which is of interest not only to the research and policy communities engaged in the topic but also to the user communities that require guidance when developing or deploying AI systems. Originality/value The authors believe that they have managed to compile the most comprehensive document collecting existing guidance which can guide practical action but will hopefully also support the consolidation of the guidelines landscape. The authors' findings should also be of academic interest and inspire philosophical research on the consistency and justification of the various normative statements that can be found in the literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1477-996X;1758-8871;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1108/JICES-12-2019-0138;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000539597700001;;;;;;
J;Romele, A;;;;Romele, Alberto;;;The datafication of the worldview;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;The goal of this article is twofold. First, it aims at sketching the outlines of material hermeneutics as a three-level analysis of technological artefacts. In the first section, we introduce Erwin Panofsky's three levels of interpretation of an artwork, and we propose to import this approach in the field of philosophy of technology. Second, the rest of the article focuses on the third level, with a specific attention towards big data and algorithms of artificial intelligence. The thesis is that these new technologies are not only radically transforming our interactions with the world, or our modes of production and consumption, but also our worldview. In the second section, we rely on Panofsky'sGothic Architecture and Scholasticismto describe the Scholastic mental habit or worldview and its principles. In the third section, we confront this worldview with the mechanistic and informationistic worldviews. Our contribution consists in arguing that (1) despite the differences, the Scholastic, mechanistic, and informationistic worldviews are part of the same logical and causal order that dominated Western epistemology, and (2) today we are facing the appearance of a new worldview that we call data worldview. Examples from design, architecture, and visualization of knowledge will be set all along the article.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00146-020-00989-x;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000539173900001;;;;;;

Miniaturization of semiconductors requires the discussion of quantum theory on the order of tens of nanometers, and metrology (measurement technology) that supports this requirement has the potential of creating new research fields. Super-resolution optical technology is a common measurement technique that exceeds the physical limit. Moreover, advanced integrated metrology techniques, which include a combination of various kinds of metrology techniques coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), have the potential to evolve into an untapped technological field required by the market. We conduct extensive discussions on the implications of AI/ML. A new way of advanced integrated metrology can be considered as an important role for the fabrication of next generation integrated circuit and be connected to value-added creation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1348-0391;;;;;JUN 4;2020;18;;;;;;214;222;;10.1380/ejssnt.2020.214;;;;;;;WOS:000542645400001;;;;;;

Design/methodology/approach This paper examines Colombian money laundering situations with some methodologies of network science to apply AI tools. Findings This paper identifies the suspicious operations with AI methodologies, which are not common by number, quantity or characteristics within the economic or financial system and normal practices of companies or industries. Research limitations/implications Access to financial institutions' data was the most difficult element for research because affect the implementation of a set of different algorithms and network science methodologies. Practical implications This paper tries to reduce the social and economic implications from money laundering (ML) that result from illegal activities and different crimes against inhabitants, governments, public resources and financial systems. Social implications This paper proposes a software architecture methodology to fight against ML and financial crime networks in Colombia which are common in different countries. These methodologies complement legal structure and regulatory framework. Originality/value The contribution of this paper is how within the flow already regulated by financial institutions to manage the ML risk, AI can be used to minimize and identify this kind of risk. For this reason, the authors propose to use the graph analysis methodology for monitoring and identifying the behavior of different ML patterns with machine learning techniques and network science methodologies.

J;Lopez-Rubio, E;;;;Lopez-Rubio, Ezequiel;;;Throwing light on black boxes: emergence of visual categories from deep learning;SYNTHESE;;;;;;;;;;;;One of the best known arguments against the connectionist approach to artificial intelligence and cognitive science is that neural networks are black boxes, i.e., there is no understandable account of their operation. This difficulty has impeded efforts to explain how categories arise from raw sensory data. Moreover, it has complicated investigation about the role of symbols and language in cognition. This state of things has been radically changed by recent experimental findings in artificial deep learning research. Two kinds of artificial deep learning networks, namely the convolutional neural network and the generative adversarial network have been found to possess the capability to build internal states that are interpreted by humans as complex visual categories, without any specific hints or any grammatical processing. This emergent ability suggests that those categories do not depend on human knowledge or the syntactic structure of language, while they do rely on their visual context. This supports a mild form of empiricism, while it does not assume that computational functionalism is true. Some consequences are extracted regarding the debate about amodal and grounded representations in the human brain. Furthermore, new avenues for research on cognitive science are open.;;;;Lopez-Rubio, Ezequiel/K-3821-2014;Lopez-Rubio, Ezequiel/0000-0001-8231-5687;;;;;;;;;;;;0039-7857;1573-0964;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s11229-020-02700-5;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000537675800001;;;;;;

Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was conducted combining qualitative and quantitative approaches. A code book based on early systematic literature reviews was developed and used to extract information from 62 discrete peer-reviewed English articles. An inductive approach was used to analyse definitions of chatbots, topics, metrics, perspectives and implications. Findings Chatbots have been studied by many different disciplines, but not much from organizational, stakeholder and corporate communication perspectives. Existing studies focus on the technical developments of chatbots and chatbot language and conversations skills. Research has remained anchored at the micro-level understanding of the phenomenon, that is, the nature of chatbots, but has not yet taken into consideration the meso (organizational) or macro (societal) levels. Research limitations/implications This study focused only on academic peer-reviewed papers in English and excluded conference proceeding, books, book chapters and editorials that may have offered other important and relevant reflections. The limited number of studies in communication-related disciplines shows that corporate communication scholars could contribute more to the discussion of chatbot-stakeholder interactions. Originality/value This is the first research in the field of corporate communication that examines organizational chatbot-stakeholder interactions. Results of this review offer important information on chatbots' organizational capabilities and affordances, which, arguably, must be taken into consideration when stakeholder engagement strategies are set.;;;;;Syvanen/0000-0002-7368-6272;;;;;;;;;;;;1363-254X;1478-0852;;;;OCT 5;2020;24;4;;;SI;;339;362;;10.1108/JCOM-11-2019-0145;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000538504100001;;;;;;

A total of 768 courses from 17 bachelor degree programs and 116 courses from 8 master's degree programs are analyzed. Opinions of experts in AI were also collected regarding how the application of AI in teaching will change the relationship with university students, especially in communication programs. The results reveal that the Spanish educational offering in AI is insufficient, as there are very few specific proposals for the total or partial study of the transformations of journalistic roles, routines and conventions. This is especially important in a context in which this emerging technology will cause a transformative revolution by allowing ultra-personalized teaching with tools for anticipating and identifying teaching/learning problems, paces, preferences and deficiencies in both face-to-face and online teaching environments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0211-2175;2340-5236;;;;JUN;2020;;62;;;;;131;146;;10.5565/rev/analisi.3289;;;;;;;WOS:000585233200009;;;;;;

Artificial Intelligence can have massive impact on national purposes with economic value being the main target, as it brings the state more prosperity with technology innovation. The Indonesia government encourages the development of AI, however, current Indonesian Copyright Act is out of date and is not in line with the spirit of industrial revolution 4.0. One of the reason the existing Copyright Act is incoherent with the new technology is because the use of Fair Use doctrine is too narrow making it a barrier for the inventors. The Strict Fair Use doctrine has become irrelevant in the era of AI. This article will consider the ways to avoid the potential infringement of AI, and the concept of fair use doctrine that are relevant in the era of AI. This will include the modern copyright law optimizing the economic value of AI, and to reformulate copyright act to be more in line with the current technology development.

However, their full potential is not yet exploited. For the time being, users are restricted to calling predefined functions. Soon, users will expect to customize systems to their needs and create own functions using nothing but spoken instructions. Thus, future systems must understand how laypersons teach new functionality to intelligent systems. The understanding of natural language teaching sequences is a first step toward comprehensive end-user programming in natural language. We propose to analyze the semantics of spoken teaching sequences with a hierarchical classification approach. First, we classify whether an utterance constitutes an effort to teach a new function or not. Afterward, a second classifier locates the distinct semantic parts of teaching efforts: declaration of a new function, specification of intermediate steps, and superfluous information. For both tasks we implement a broad range of machine learning techniques: classical approaches, such as Naive Bayes, and neural network configurations of various types and architectures, such as bidirectional LSTMs. Additionally, we introduce two heuristic-based adaptations that are tailored to the task of understanding teaching sequences. As data basis we use 3168 descriptions gathered in a user study. For the first task convolutional neural networks obtain the best results (accuracy: 96.6%); bidirectional LSTMs excel in the second (accuracy: 98.8%). The adaptations improve the first-level classification considerably (plus 2.2% points).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1793-351X;1793-7108;;;;JUN;2020;14;2;;;SI;;249;272;;10.1142/S1793351X20400097;;;;;;;WOS:000575875200005;;;;;;

However, against Davidson, Kuczynski claims that his reasoning is entirely fallacious and has little force in attacking the Turing Test. In this paper I will first delineate and clarify Davidson's comments on Turing's imitation game and his reasons for reject it as a proper test of machine thinking. Second, I will object to Kuczynski's criticisms by showing that his arguments are either ill-founded, inconclusive, or based on his misinterpretation of Davidson's thought. Finally, I will show how Davidson proposes to modify the Test in accordance with his own theory of interpretation, and the significance of this modified version for the attribution of thought to AI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1021-3058;1991-7864;;;;JUN;2020;50;2;;;;;147;178;;10.7015/JEAS.202006_50(2)0002;;;;;;;WOS:000574464700002;;;;;;

According to the behaviourist conception of moral agency, if robots, assessed purely on the basis of behaviour, perform as morally as humans, they can be considered moral agents. This naturally leads to moral anthropomorphism: the position that whatever moral standards apply to humans apply equally to robots. I argue against moral anthropomorphism. In light of P. F.

J;Hung, TW;;;;Hung, Tzu-Wei;;;A Preliminary Study of Normative Issues of AI Prediction;EURAMERICA;;;;;;;;;;;;"This paper focuses on normative aspects of AI prediction-that is, technologies used to predict the future through analyses of big data concerning the past. While this technology seems promising in forecasting extreme weather or rehabilitating endangered wildlife, it is controversial when applied to human beings, e.g., an Israeli company is using AI prediction to identify possible terrorists, and China's government to locate potential dissidents. This paper explores some of the normative issues and argues: (1) AI-derived conclusions are inexplicable not because machines fail to provide mechanical steps, but because our limited cognitive power cannot assign meaning to the, probably billions of, steps, and thus we fail to understand the conclusions reached by AI; (2) while AI is considered to have an inductive problem, to be a black box, and to have other epistemological issues, these worries apply to the human brain as well. AI and the human brain are different in degree rather than type; (3) the necessity argument and the reality condition cannot be used to exclude radical cases (e.g., China's social credit system) without excluding existing laws or social norms; and (4) the principle of autonomy has advantages, which include balancing power and responsibility, and reduces public distrust.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1021-3058;1991-7864;;;;JUN;2020;50;2;;;;;207;229;;10.7015/JEAS.202006_50(2).0004;;;;;;;WOS:000574464700004;;;;;;
J;"Gan, ZR; Hsu, H";;;;"Gan, Zhen-Rong; Hsu, Hahn";;;A Preliminary Study of AI Ethical Duality: AI Ethics and Ethical AIs;EURAMERICA;;;;;;;;;;;;AI (artificial intelligence) is characterized by autonomous learning and reactive capabilities. Arguably, these characteristics mean AIs can be held liable for failing to adhere to ethical, legal and social regulations when undertaking autonomous acts. In this paper, we consider the duality of AI ethics: that AI ethics should work both for humans and Artificial Intelligences. We lay out a more inclusive ethical view which would accommodate the idea of AIs characterized by distributive agency, which posits that AIs possess only a minimal degree of autonomy or intelligent autonomy in virtue of which AIs can be given a certain agency status. The agency status of AI will differ from that of human beings, governments, and corporations, nonetheless, the inclusive view also suggests that AIs ought to be held accountable for their acts: shared responsibility. We also suggest an idea of a bottom-line view of moral obligations as the starting point for the duality of AI ethics. Finally, we suggest an implementation mechanism of AI ethics based on case evaluations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1021-3058;1991-7864;;;;JUN;2020;50;2;;;;;231;292;;10.7015/JEAS.202006_50(2).0005;;;;;;;WOS:000574464700005;;;;;;
J;Chen, HJ;;;;Chen, Hung-Ju;;;No Vehicles in the Park?: On AI's Teleological Interpretation in Law;EURAMERICA;;;;;;;;;;;;Legal purposes not only contribute to the meaning of legal norms but also help lawyers arrive at legal conclusions, and even provide justificatory force. Engineers in Artificial Intelligence and Law also recognize the importance of teleological reasoning in law and aim at building a computational model capable of teleological interpretation, no matter in models of statutory reasoning or case-based reasoning. This paper investigates the problem of teleological interpretation in CMLRs. It points out that CMLRs are capable of operating teleological reasoning within a limited scope but incompetent to deal with normative issues such as why certain values shall be realized through a teleological interpretation. This is because CMLRs in a purposive interpretation function to predict future possible outcomes, but it is another (fundamental) question regarding how this presupposed possible world fits into the normative state of affairs of a legal purpose. This article makes two contributions. First, it directly focuses on the form and structure of purposive interpretation providing analysis and reflections on its applicative problem in CMLRs. Second, it clarifies the relationship between a legal purpose and meaning of a legal norm. This clarification helps CMLRs to understand to what extent a model design of teleological interpretation is acceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1021-3058;1991-7864;;;;JUN;2020;50;2;;;;;293;347;;10.7015/JEAS.202006_50(2).0006;;;;;;;WOS:000574464700006;;;;;;
J;Horng, DC;;;;Horng, Der-Chin;;;EU Development Strategy and Legal Control of Automated Vehicles;EURAMERICA;;;;;;;;;;;;Automated vehicles (AVs) have been an emerging industry in line with the development of artificial intelligence (AI), digital technology, and connected mobility since 2010. These technologies arrived suddenly on the market, and their future development is expected to accelerate. AVs promise many opportunities and benefits, but also pose many challenges regarding their social impact and the transport system. Regulation plays a key role in the development of AVs in the EU, ensuring AV safety, delineating legal responsibilities, privacy and consumer protection, risk control, fair competition, market access, public confidence, etc. The EU has paid a great deal of attention to AV because the automobile industry is crucially important to the European economy. This paper examines the development strategy and legal framework for AV in the EU, particularly focusing on the following core issues: the concept of AV, development, strategy, safety requirements, opportunities and challenges of the AV, the formation of Intelligent Transport System, the specific features of the EU's AV regulation and policies, the significance and impact of the same, and any implications for Taiwan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1021-3058;1991-7864;;;;JUN;2020;50;2;;;;;349;431;;10.7015/JEAS.202006_50(2).0007;;;;;;;WOS:000574464700007;;;;;;
J;"Zhou, ZP; Xu, PF; Dong, XW";;;;"Zhou Zhiping; Xu Pengfei; Dong Xiaowen";;;Computing on Silicon Photonic Platform;CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG;;;;;;;;;;;;Scientists have been exploring the optical computing system for decades, in hoping that it will have faster speed and lower energy consumption to break the limitations of the traditional electronic computing system. However, due to the ineffective optical logic units, slow electronic interconnects, and lack of optical memory, the idea of the optical computing did not go too far and was eventually abandoned. In the era of big data, the flow and usage of information have been increased exponentially, which provides a unique opportunity for the rapid development of the silicon photonic technology. The heterogeneous integration of electronics and photonics on the same silicon substrate, the Silicon Photonics, ensures a wide-bandwidth, high-speed, low-cost, low energyconsumption, and application -oriented optoelectronic computing platform. Here, we review the recent efforts of computing using silicon photonic technology, including artificial neural network accelerators, heuristic solvers of nondeterministic polynomial problems, analog calculations, quantum logic processors, and neuromorphic photonics, and propose a computing structure based on silicon photonic platform to take the advantages of high speed optical parallel processing and high capacity optical interconnections at the same time. We expect the Silicon Photonics will be the best technology to solve the computing challenges and problems in the electronical or optical domain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0258-7025;;;;;JUN;2020;47;6;;;;;;;600001;10.3788/CJL202047.0600001;;;;;;;WOS:000571460100001;;;;;;

For this systematic review, papers were collected from three academic databases: Scopus, Web of Science, and Academic Search Complete. From 1,222 papers reviewed, 36 papers were included. The findings indicate that there are four relationships between AI and race (i). AI causes unequal opportunities for people from certain racial groups, (ii). AI helps to detect racial discrimination, (iii). AI is applied to study health conditions of specific racial population groups, and (iv). AI is used to study demographics and facial images of people from different racial backgrounds. To widen the knowledge related to AI and race, all four finding categories in this review included supplementary studies as lessons learned for legal information management research. The authors, Channarong Intahchomphoo and Odd Erik Gundersen, use these findings to discuss how AI could impact libraries and how legal information management professionals might have to cope with the problem of biased AI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1472-6696;1741-2021;;;;JUN;2020;20;2;;;;;74;84;PII S147266962000016X;10.1017/S1472669620000183;;;;;;;WOS:000569874800004;;;;;;

The idea of Programs with Common Sense was the main and central goal of Classical AI; it was, mainly built around an internal, updatable cognitive model of the world. But, now almost all the proposed models and approaches lacked reasoning and cognitive models and have been transferred to be more data driven. In this paper, different approaches and techniques of AI are reviewed, specifying how these approaches strayed from the main goal of Classical AI, and emphasizing how to return to its main objective. Additionally, most of the terms and concepts used in this field such as Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Deep Learning are highlighted. Moreover, the relations among these terms are determined, trying to remove mysterious and ambiguities around them. The transition from the Classical AI to Neuro-Symbolic AI and the need for new Cognitive-based models are also explained and discussed.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2158-107X;2156-5570;;;;JUN;2020;11;6;;;;;70;76;;;;;;;;;WOS:000568849400009;;;;;;

In medical imaging, harmonized data exchange formats such as Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine and electronic data storage are the standard, partially addressing the first issue, but the requirements for privacy preservation are equally strict. To prevent patient privacy compromise while promoting scientific research on large datasets that aims to improve patient care, the implementation of technical solutions to simultaneously address the demands for data protection and utilization is mandatory. Here we present an overview of current and next-generation methods for federated, secure and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence with a focus on medical imaging applications, alongside potential attack vectors and future prospects in medical imaging and beyond. Medical imaging data is often subject to privacy and intellectual property restrictions. AI techniques can help out by offering tools like federated learning to bridge the gap between personal data protection and data utilisation for research and clinical routine, but these tools need to be secure.;;;;;Rueckert, Daniel/0000-0002-5683-5889;;;;;;;;;;;;;2522-5839;;;;JUN;2020;2;6;;;;;305;311;;10.1038/s42256-020-0186-1;;;;;;;WOS:000567382000007;;;;;;

Can an AI-based system be appointed as a board member? Can boards delegate specific tasks to AI-based systems? What are the implications and consequences of AI-involvement when designing the corporate structure? How does the choice to resort to, or to depart from the suggestions of an AI-based system expose, eliminate, or alleviate directorial liability?

J;Lipniewicz, R;;;;Lipniewicz, Rafal;;;Place of Effective Management in the Digital Economy;INTERTAX;;;;;;;;;;;;Tax residence is one of the essential elements of an international tax regime that is based on a network of tax treaties. In the traditional economy, the identification of the place of tax residence of companies usually does not create interpretative problems. However, the dynamic development of the digital economy raises questions as to whether the concept of the place of effective management (POEM) is also an appropriate instrument for companies. It is used as a tie-breaker rule and national residence lest based on the axiom of one location of the place where major decisions are made that affect the functioning of the enterprise as a whole. However, due to the growing importance of data collection, processing, and monetization processes - with the intensive use of advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence - it changes hierarchical, linear management models and implements an approach based on decentralization and dispersion of decision-making processes. The considerations contained in this article also pertain to the issue of the desirability of developing a tax connector other than the POEM from the perspective of examining the nature of the economic relationships of 'digital companies' with the state for the purposes of tax law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0165-2826;1875-8347;;;;JUN;2020;48;6-7;;;;;602;615;;;;;;;;;WOS:000562492000005;;;;;;

Such challenges include the processing of large volumes of data, the analysis of various dynamic indicators, the discovery of complex dependencies in the accumulated data, and the forecasting of the state of processes. The main point of this study is the development of a set of analytical and prognostic methods. The methods described in this article based on fuzzy logic, statistic, and time series data mining, because data extracted from dynamic systems are initially incomplete and have a high degree of uncertainty. The ultimate goal of the study is to improve the quality of data analysis in industrial and economic systems. The advantages of the proposed methods are flexibility and orientation to the high interpretability of dynamic data. The high level of the interpretability and interoperability of dynamic data is achieved due to a combination of time series data mining and knowledge base engineering methods. The merging of a set of rules extracted from the time series and knowledge base rules allow for making a forecast in case of insufficiency of the length and nature of the time series. The proposed methods are also based on the summarization of the results of processes modeling for diagnosing technical systems, forecasting of the economic condition of enterprises, and approaches to the technological preparation of production in a multi-productive production program with the application of type 2 fuzzy sets for time series modeling. Intelligent systems based on the proposed methods demonstrate an increase in the quality and stability of their functioning.

In human-computer interaction, a human gesture is a non-verbal communication mode, as users communicate with a computer via input devices. In this article, 3D micro hand gesture recognition disparity experiments are proposed using CNN. This study includes twelve 3D micro hand motions recorded for three different subjects. The system is validated by an experiment that is implemented on twenty different subjects of different ages. The results are analysed and evaluated based on execution time, training, testing, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and likelihood. The CNN training results show an accuracy as high as 100%, which present superior performance in all factors. On the other hand, the validation results average about 99% accuracy. The CNN algorithm has proven to be the most accurate classification tool for micro gesture recognition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2227-7080;;;;JUN;2020;8;2;;;;;;;19;10.3390/technologies8020019;;;;;;;WOS:000551241300005;;;;;;

Major reason for this is the lack of reliable information about the quality, suitability, and availability of recycled plastics, which is partly due to lack of proper segregation techniques. In this paper, we present our ongoing efforts to segregate plastics based on its types and improve the reliability of information about recycled plastics using the first-of-its-kindblockchain smart contractspowered bymulti-sensor data-fusion algorithms using artificial intelligence. We have demonstrated how different data-fusion modes can be employed to retrieve various physico-chemical parameters of plastic waste for accurate segregation. We have discussed how these smart tools help in efficiently segregating commingled plastics and can be reliably used in the circular economy of plastic. Using these tools, segregators, recyclers, and manufacturers can reliably share data, plan the supply chain, execute purchase orders, and hence, finally increase the use of recycled plastic feedstock.;;;;Sankaran, Krishnaswamy/K-5899-2015;"Sankaran, Krishnaswamy/0000-0001-7099-2728; Kulkarni, Devyani/0000-0002-7153-9447; Qazi, Mustafa/0000-0001-9844-7684; Bindra, Prabhleen/0000-0001-5184-5933";;;;;;;;;;;;;2076-3387;;;;JUN;2020;10;2;;;;;;;23;10.3390/admsci10020023;;;;;;;WOS:000551252900006;;;;;;

However, this demands more robust methodologies to assess the final aroma profiles and physicochemical characteristics of beers. This research shows the construction of artificial intelligence (AI) models based on aroma profiles, chemometrics, and chemical fingerprinting using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) obtained from 20 commercial beers used as targets. Results showed that machine learning models obtained using NIR from beers as inputs were accurate and robust in the prediction of six important aromas for beer (Model 1; R = 0.91; b = 0.87) and chemometrics (Model 2; R = 0.93; b = 0.90). Additionally, two more accurate models were obtained from robotics (RoboBEER) to obtain the same aroma profiles (Model 3; R = 0.99; b = 1.00) and chemometrics (Model 4; R = 0.98; b = 1.00). Low-cost robotics and sensors coupled with computer vision and machine learning modeling could help brewers in the decision-making process to target specific consumer preferences and to secure higher consumer demands.";;;;"Viejo, Claudia Gonzalez/Q-9007-2019; Fuentes, Sigfredo/J-6238-2015";"Viejo, Claudia Gonzalez/0000-0001-9207-9307; Fuentes, Sigfredo/0000-0002-0377-5085";;;;;;;;;;;;;2311-5637;;;;JUN;2020;6;2;;;;;;;56;10.3390/fermentation6020056;;;;;;;WOS:000551232000022;;;;;;

However, the neural machine translation (NMT) models still struggle in the translation task on agglutinative languages with complex morphology and limited resources. Inspired by the finding that utilizing the source-side linguistic knowledge can further improve the NMT performance, we propose a multi-source neural model that employs two separate encoders to encode the source word sequence and the linguistic feature sequences. Compared with the standard NMT model, we utilize an additional encoder to incorporate the linguistic features of lemma, part-of-speech (POS) tag, and morphological tag by extending the input embedding layer of the encoder. Moreover, we use a serial combination method to integrate the conditional information from the encoders with the outputs of the decoder, which aims to enhance the neural model to learn a high-quality context representation of the source sentence. Experimental results show that our approach is effective for the agglutinative language translation, which achieves the highest improvements of +2.4 BLEU points on Turkish-English translation task and +0.6 BLEU points on Uyghur-Chinese translation task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1999-5903;;;;JUN;2020;12;6;;;;;;;96;10.3390/fi12060096;;;;;;;WOS:000551238000013;;;;;;
J;Baum, SD;;;;Baum, Seth D.;;;Medium-Term Artificial Intelligence and Society;INFORMATION;;;;;;;;;;;;There has been extensive attention to near-term and long-term AI technology and its accompanying societal issues, but the medium-term has gone largely overlooked. This paper develops the concept of medium-term AI, evaluates its importance, and analyzes some medium-term societal issues. Medium-term AI can be important in its own right and as a topic that can bridge the sometimes acrimonious divide between those who favor attention to near-term AI and those who prefer the long-term. The paper proposes the medium-term AI hypothesis: the medium-term is important from the perspectives of those who favor attention to near-term AI as well as those who favor attention to long-term AI. The paper analyzes medium-term AI in terms of governance institutions, collective action, corporate AI development, and military/national security communities. Across portions of these four areas, some support for the medium-term AI hypothesis is found, though in some cases the matter is unclear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2078-2489;;;;JUN;2020;11;6;;;;;;;290;10.3390/info11060290;;;;;;;WOS:000551236800033;;;;;;

Thus, the ability of artificial intelligence systems to detect possible breast cancer is very important. In this paper, an ensemble classification mechanism is proposed based on a majority voting mechanism. First, the performance of different state-of-the-art machine learning classification algorithms were evaluated for the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD). The three best classifiers were then selected based on their F3 score. F3 score is used to emphasize the importance of false negatives (recall) in breast cancer classification. Then, these three classifiers, simple logistic regression learning, support vector machine learning with stochastic gradient descent optimization and multilayer perceptron network, are used for ensemble classification using a voting mechanism. We also evaluated the performance of hard and soft voting mechanism. For hard voting, majority-based voting mechanism was used and for soft voting we used average of probabilities, product of probabilities, maximum of probabilities and minimum of probabilities-based voting methods. The hard voting (majority-based voting) mechanism shows better performance with 99.42%, as compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm for WBCD.;;;;;VELASTIN, SERGIO ALEJANDRO/0000-0001-6775-7137;;;;;;;;;;;;;2313-433X;;;;JUN;2020;6;6;;;;;;;39;10.3390/jimaging6060039;;;;;;;WOS:000551247200006;;;;;;
J;Huibers, FE;;;;Huibers, Fred E.;;;Towards an Optimal IPO Mechanism;JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT;;;;;;;;;;;;Concerns about the negative consequences of the excessive underpricing of the current arrangement in the initial public offering (IPO) market for the provision of entrepreneurial finance-book building-have led to research into the viability of auctions for IPO pricing and allocation. IPO firms face a trade-off between the benefit of accurate and reliable IPO price discovery and the cost of underpricing. The main aim of this paper was to gain new scientific knowledge about this trade-off by measuring the impact of two key variables on this trade-off: capacity restraint and discount on the auction clearing price. Using controlled experiment methodology in multi-unit uniform price auctions we found that the most capacity-restricted auctions that also offer investors a discount are likely to produce the most accurate and reliable price discovery and consequently, the most predictable auction outcome. There are indications that a discount of 8% may suffice to incentivize investors to reliably contribute to price discovery. The resulting underpricing (and its variability) of these auctions is likely to be significantly lower than if book building would be used to price and allocate IPOs. Technological innovation in the IPO market through the application of recent advances in data science, experimental economics and artificial intelligence allows for the optimization of IPO mechanisms and crowdfunding platforms which in turn improves the access to equity required for entrepreneurial finance.;;;;;Huibers, Fred/0000-0001-8727-4933;;;;;;;;;;;;1911-8066;1911-8074;;;;JUN;2020;13;6;;;;;;;115;10.3390/jrfm13060115;;;;;;;WOS:000551232500018;;;;;;

Currently, challenges in this domain have motivated research efforts towards providing cognitive solutions for IoT usage. One such solution, termed cognitive sensing (CS) describes the use of smart sensors to intelligently perceive inputs from the environment. Further, CS has been proposed for use in FIoT in order to facilitate smart, secure and energy-efficient data collection processes. In this article, we provide a survey of different Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based techniques used over the last decade to provide cognitive sensing solutions for different FIoT applications. We present some state-of-the-art approaches, potentials, and challenges of AI techniques for the identified solutions.

This is the relevant question posed by Ploug and Holm in a recent article inMedicine, Health Care and Philosophy. In this article, I adhere to their conclusions, but not necessarily to the rationale that supports them. First, I argue that the idea that we should recognize this right on the basis of a rational interest defence is not plausible, unless we are willing to judge each patient's ideology or religion. Instead, I consider that the right must be recognized by virtue of values such as social pluralism or individual autonomy. Second, I point out that the scope of such a right should be limited at least under three circumstances: (1) if it is against a physician's obligation to not cause unnecessary harm to a patient or to not provide futile treatment, (2) in cases where the costs of implementing this right are too high, or (3) if recognizing the right would deprive other patients of their own rights to adequate health care.;;;;;DE MIGUEL BERIAIN, INIGO/0000-0002-2650-5280;;;;;;;;;;;;1386-7423;1572-8633;;;;JUN;2020;23;2;;;;;247;252;;10.1007/s11019-020-09939-2;;;;;;;WOS:000551106700011;31960228;;;;;

The aim of this pilot research study is to explore the gap in second language acquisition research for technologically savvy Generation Z, whose members use modern technologies, especially mobile applications, in their learning process in a massive way. More specifically, the authors focus on students' perceptions of the use of traditional and blended learning supported by an eLearning course in order to reveal students' attitudes to and expectations from these learning modalities. Altogether, 40 university students participated in an experiment. The findings clearly show that the present eLearning platform is no longer an attractive option for students of Generation Z since these students want to participate in the creation of its content and collaborate and interact with each other in ways they are used to with other social media platforms such as Facebook. The implications of the research are important for educators and designers of various eLearning courses who need to take this into account. Further implications suggest a new approach to the exploitation of eLearning platform connected to Web 4.0. The basic principle of the new approach is to use these platforms and should harness all the possibilities of artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning, and computational linguistics. In conclusion, the study reflects the basic and pragmatic principles upon which eLearning 4.0 should be based in order to become a more efficient tool for modern education and sustainability.;;;;"Pikhart, Marcel/D-8945-2012; Klimova, Blanka/F-7016-2019";"Pikhart, Marcel/0000-0002-5633-9332; Klimova, Blanka/0000-0001-8000-9766";;;;;;;;;;;;;2075-4698;;;;JUN;2020;10;2;;;;;;;38;10.3390/soc10020038;;;;;;;WOS:000551230900012;;;;;;

Current literature suggests there are many potential benefits that could transform future clinical workflows and decision making. Embedding AI and ML concepts in radiation therapy education could be a funda- mental step in equipping radiation therapists (RTs) to engage in competent and safe practice as they utilise clinical technologies. In this discussion paper, the authors provide a brief review of some applications of AI and ML in radiation therapy and discuss pertinent considerations for radiation therapy curriculum enhancement. As the current literature suggests, AI and ML ap- proaches will impose changes to routine clinical radiation therapy tasks. The emphasis in RT education could be on critical evaluation of AI and ML application in routine clinical workflows and gaining an understanding of the impact on quality assurance, provision of quality of care and safety in radiation therapy as well as research. It is also imperative RTs have a broader understanding of AI/ML impact on health care, including ethical and legal considerations.

The present study proposes using a deep learning-based object detection method to identify periodontally compromised teeth on digital panoramic radiographs. A faster regional convolutional neural network (faster R-CNN) which is a state-of-the-art deep detection network, was adapted from the natural image domain using a small annotated clinical data-set. Materials and Methods : In total, 100 digital panoramic radiographs of periodontally compromised patients were retrospectively collected from our hospital?s information system and augmented. The periodontally compromised teeth found in each image were annotated by experts in periodontology to obtain the ground truth. The Keras library, which is written in Python, was used to train and test the model on a single NVidia 1080Ti GPU. The faster R-CNN model used a pretrained ResNet architecture. Results : The average precision rate of 0.81 demonstrated that there was a significant region of overlap between the predicted regions and the ground truth. The average recall rate of 0.80 showed that the periodontally compromised teeth regions generated by the detection method excluded healthiest teeth areas. In addition, the model achieved a sensitivity of 0.84, a specificity of 0.88 and an F-measure of 0.81. Conclusion : The faster R-CNN trained on a limited amount of labeled imaging data performed satisfactorily in detecting periodontally compromised teeth. The application of a faster R-CNN to assist in the detection of periodontally compromised teeth may reduce diagnostic effort by saving assessment time and allowing automated screening documentation.

However, the emerging literature points to several socio-ethical challenges which may act as inhibitors to the adoption in the minds of the consumers. We also observe a paucity of research focusing on determinants of adoption and use of AI-based CAs in mental healthcare. In this setting, this study aims to understand the factors influencing the adoption and use of Intelligent CAs in mental healthcare by examining the perceptions of actual users. Method: The study followed a qualitative approach based on netnography and used a rigorous iterative thematic analysis of publicly available user reviews of popular mental health chatbots to develop a comprehensive framework of factors influencing the user's decision to adopt mental healthcare CA. Results: We developed a comprehensive thematic map comprising of four main themes, namely, perceived risk, perceived benefits, trust, and perceived anthropomorphism, along with its 12 constituent subthemes that provides a visualization of the factors that govern the user's adoption and use of mental healthcare CA. Conclusions: Insights from our research could guide future research on mental healthcare CA use behavior. Additionally, it could also aid designers in framing better design decisions that meet consumer expectations. Our research could also guide healthcare policymakers and regulators in integrating this technology into formal healthcare delivery systems.;;;;PRAKASH, ASHISH VISWANATH/J-3486-2014;PRAKASH, ASHISH VISWANATH/0000-0002-7468-9723;;;;;;;;;;;;1943-7536;1943-7544;;;;JUN;2020;12;2;;;;;1;34;;10.17705/1pais.12201;;;;;;;WOS:000546552800001;;;;;;

Over the past decades, scientists from different countries have proposed different options: to give robots the status of a legal entity, to invent a novel concept - an electronic person, some even dared to compare them with a person. Others spoke about the danger of giving robots any legal status. In April last year, the independent European Commission High- Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG) published a new version of the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, along with a document defining artificial intelligence. This definition raises a lot of serious questions for lawyers and it is extremely difficult to answer them even using the existing theoretical instrumentarium. The immediate task of enforcing the AI HLEG requirements falls on the shoulders of lawyers. Such a task is not an easy one, taking into account the lack of established practice and appropriate legislative framework. It has to be created and implemented under the existing norms. It is almost impossible to do this without having a clear understanding of artificial intelligence and its legal status. The key point in the definition proposed by AI HLEG is that artificial intelligence acts... by deciding.... Such a wording jeopardizes the fundamental requirement for human governance and oversight. As we know from the theory of law, the life circumstances with which the law binds the emergence, change or termination of legal relations are called legal facts (events and actions). In the light of the above, there is a reasonable question about the place of actions taken at the discretion of artificial intelligence (i.e. based on the decisions it made) in the system of legal facts, until recently actions were the prerogative of people. Thus, we have events that do not objectively depend on the will and consciousness of people. Indeed, if even created and programmed by man the artificial intelligence system independently decides about its actions in each situation, then the will and consciousness of men have absolutely nothing to do with it. At this stage, we have to state that from a legal point of view, the independent actions of artificial intelligence systems formally fall under the signs of natural disasters. Anyway, it has become obvious that in addition to the transformation of labor markets, modernization of education systems and retraining of citizens (the things the European Union much concerned with), lawyers around the world will have to adapt the foundations of the theory of law to this changing at the velocity of sound mad, insane, crazy world. Unless artificial intelligence does it for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2225-3513;2311-3693;;;;JUN;2020;;36;;;;;145;152;;10.17223/22253513/36/13;;;;;;;WOS:000546992300013;;;;;;

Whether schools encourage students to be cybersmart (Australia), netsafe (New Zealand) or to be aware of cybersecurity strategies (Mexico and Chile) most now devote a relatively large amount of time and money to teaching young people how to stay safe online. In this article, we argue that it is time for schools to move beyond the cybersafety discourse to encourage students to think more critically about the digital media they use. Reporting on the digital practices of 276 pre-teens aged 7-12 years in Australia and Uruguay, we contend that the everyday digital challenges young people face are now beyond the scope of most cybersafety programs. Our findings highlight that many of the issues preteens are negotiating call for more nuanced and sustained educational programs that support the development of critical social media literacies. In particular, with the proliferation of mass user platforms and artificial intelligence, there is a need for schools to educate students around managing and protecting their personal data.

Diagnostic endoscopy is an attractive substrate for artificial intelligence with a real potential to improve patient care through standardisation of endoscopic diagnosis and to serve as an adjunct to enhanced imaging diagnosis. The possibility to amass large data to refine algorithms makes adoption of artificial intelligence into global practice a potential reality. Initial studies in luminal endoscopy involve machine learning and are retrospective. Improvement in diagnostic performance is appreciable through the adoption of deep learning. Research foci in the upper gastrointestinal tract include the diagnosis of neoplasia, including Barrett's, squamous cell and gastric where prospective and real-time artificial intelligence studies have been completed demonstrating a benefit of artificial intelligence-augmented endoscopy. Deep learning applied to small bowel capsule endoscopy also appears to enhance pathology detection and reduce capsule reading time. Prospective evaluation including the first randomised trial has been performed in the colon, demonstrating improved polyp and adenoma detection rates; however, these appear to be relevant to small polyps. There are potential additional roles of artificial intelligence relevant to improving the quality of endoscopic examinations, training and triaging of referrals.

RRAM crossbar arrays improve the efficiency of vector-matrix multiplications (VMMs), which is a vital operation in these applications. The prototype IC is the first complete, fully integrated analog-RRAM CMOS coprocessor. This article focuses on the digital and analog circuitry that supports efficient and flexible RRAM-based computation. A passive 54x108 RRAM crossbar array performs VMM in the analog domain. Specialized mixed-signal circuits stimulate and read the outputs of the RRAM crossbar. The single-chip CMOS prototype includes a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processor interfaced to a memory-mapped mixed-signal core. In the mixed-signal core, ADCs and DACs interface with the passive RRAM crossbar. The RISC processor controls the mixed-signal circuits and the algorithm data path.

The solution of the problem has been become complicated since the explanation of hydraulic phenomenon between the flow and the sediment on the river is dependent many parameters. The usage of different regression methods and artificial intelligence techniques allows the development of predictions as the traditional methods do not give enough accurate results. In this study, data of the flow and suspended sediment load (SSL) obtained from Karsikoy Gauging Station, located on Coruh River in the north-eastern of Turkey, modelled with different regression methods (multiple regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines) and artificial neural network (ANN) (ANN-back propagation, ANN teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm and ANN-artificial bee colony). When the results were evaluated, it was seen that the models of ANN method were close to each other and gave better results than the regression models.

Methods of the study were as follows: the questionnaire survey by using the Google Chrome electronic service, content analysis, methods of statistical analysis, and a focus group. The authors' version of the questionnaire was made by using the Likert methodology taking into account indicators of the QS World University Rankings rating system. The data obtained during the three stages were generalized and analyzed by using the descriptive statistics. The regression analysis was used to study the relationship between the motives of the academic staff (AS) and the nature of the stimulating effect of the university authorities on the staff of the university. Results: The discrepancy between the AS motivation structure and the range of stimulation methods applied by the university authorities, a continuous increase in the burden from introduced innovations, and the formal style for employees to fulfill new tasks have been revealed. The analysis of the results on using the techniques and methods by the university authorities to motivate and stimulate the staff has shown the need in new combinatorics, an innovative system that harmoniously combines the advantages of natural and artificial intelligence to motivate the AS in training HR for the digital economy of the 21st century. The new system should be universal and flexibly respond to constant changes in the socio-economic environment. It is important to timely eliminate the contradictions in needs and teachers' opinion on the ideal assessment system of their activities and offered forms of stimulation by universities authorities. The vectors of their activities must be constantly coordinated, based on the AI capabilities. The introduction of AI in the activities of universities improves the competitiveness of promising, innovative teachers and has positive impact on the image, efficiency, academic reputation, and citation index of universities. The authors for the first time ever have studied the problems of using the AI in the motivational system of the university's AS and offered technologies to improve the efficiency of universities by using the motivational AI. The practical importance of solving the problem is related to the real possibility of applying the offered technologies by the university authorities that strive to improve their efficiency and competitiveness in the educational market. The main advantage of the work is related to the advanced solutions of the emerging problems on using the AI in motivating the university staff identified during the three-stage study. The interdisciplinary nature of the study and the offered technologies can serve as the basis for the further study and an additional element that expands the views, approaches, and the framework of categories and concepts of the world science. Conclusion: The most suitable technologies for the university that strives to be efficient include the elimination of the imbalance in the system of staff motives incentives of the university (employer) authorities, the harmonious use of the AI in educational activities and the system of motivation and stimulation of staff where the natural intelligence prevails, and the improvement of the staff's publication and grant activities by using the AI with a synergistic effect due to efficient team building.;;;;;Karacsony, Peter/0000-0001-7559-0488;;;;;;;;;;;;2345-0282;;;;;JUN;2020;7;4;;;;;2696;2714;;10.9770/jesi.2020.7.4(9);;;;;;;WOS:000542031600008;;;;;;

The outcomes of the research reveal the effectiveness of AI is the same as experienced salesmen and 2.7 times better than inexperienced salesmen is closing the sales calls. The sales graph experienced a dip by over 86.23% when it was revealed to the customer that the interface is with the machine, not humans and reduced the duration of the call substantially. The paper shows that Indians do not believe Artificial Intelligence and still prefer human interface as they do not trust machines over human emotions. The effectiveness of AI drastically reduces despite its superiority over humans in various aspects. The paper identifies the strategies to overcome the trust deficit that exists among Indian customers.

In this paper, a new method for reactive power compensation in wind farms is proposed by using DSTATCOM with the Kohonen Learning neural network (KLNN) based control algorithm. In the proposed control strategy, instantaneous PCC voltages and load currents will be taken into account to estimate the load conductance and susceptance. KLNN will give the required load conductance and susceptance to estimate the reference supply currents. DSTATCOM will be operated as per these reference supply currents. Reactive power compensation will be achieved with the combination of KLNN and DSTATCOM.

Many of them have been used successfully as medicines, as well as the most important sources of drug leads, food additives, and many industry relevant products for millennia. Most notably, more than half of the antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs currently in use are, or derived from, natural products. However, the speed and outputs of NP-based drug discovery has been slowing down dramatically after the fruitful harvest of the low-hanging fruit during the golden age of 1950s-1960s. With recent scientific advances combining metabolic sciences and technology, multi-omics, big data, combinatorial biosynthesis, synthetic biology, genome editing technology (such as CRISPR), artificial intelligence (AI), and 3D printing, the high-hanging fruit is becoming more and more accessible with reduced costs.

Most breast cancer patients receive systemic therapy, and some treatments are given before surgery, such as neoadjuvant therapy, even in an operable setting. Improved neoadjuvant chemotherapy has increased rates of pathological complete response; however, surgery is still required to determine complete tumor remission. Inadequate preoperative evaluations after neoadjuvant therapy can result in excessive surgical stress. Clinical imaging tests such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging of the breast are often performed with neoadjuvant therapy. These clinical imaging techniques, in addition to measuring tumor size, have made it possible to evaluate certain functional aspects of the tumors. Herein, we review the current state of clinical imaging research focused on predicting neoadjuvant chemotherapy response in breast cancer. We also discuss the upfront prediction of treatment response before and during neoadjuvant therapy and the later prediction of pathological residual tumors, including pathological complete response, using ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Upfront prediction can help decision-making and develop new treatment strategies. Predicting the localization of microscopic residual tumors may contribute to disease management without surgery, using radiation or other local treatments. Further larger studies on the prediction of neoadjuvant therapy response using clinical imaging could improve clinical practice and patient benefits.";;;;;Hayashi, Mitsuhiro/0000-0001-6656-8502;;;;;;;;;;;;2304-3865;2304-3873;;;;JUN;2020;9;3;;;;;;;31;10.21037/cco-20-15;;;;;;;WOS:000543350700017;32594748;;;;;

A good biomarker should predict not only prognosis but also the response to therapies. In this review, we describe the biomarkers of neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, considering different breast cancer subtypes. In hormone receptor (HR)-positive/human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancers, various genomic markers highly associated with proliferation have been tested. Among them, only two genomic signatures, the 21-gene recurrence score and 70-gene signature, have been reported in prospective randomized clinical trials and met the primary endpoint. However, these genomic markers did not suffice in HER2-positive and triple-negative (TN) breast cancers, which present only classical clinical and pathological information (tumor size, nodal or distant metastatic status) for decision making in the adjuvant setting in daily clinic. Recently, patients with residual invasive cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy are at a high-risk of recurrence for metastasis, which, in turn, make these patients best applicants for clinical trials. Two clinical trials have shown improved outcomes with post- operative capecitabine and ado-trastuzumab emtansine treatment in patients with either TN or HER2-positive breast cancer, respectively, who had residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been reported to have a predictive value for prognosis and response to chemotherapy from the retrospective analyses. So far, TILs have to not be used to either withhold or prescribe chemotherapy based on the absence of standardized evaluation guidelines and confirmed information. To overcome the low reproducibility of evaluations of TILs, gene signatures or digital image analysis and machine learning algorithms with artificial intelligence may be useful for standardization of assessment for TILs in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2304-3865;2304-3873;;;;JUN;2020;9;3;;;;;;;27;10.21037/cco.2020.01.06;;;;;;;WOS:000543350700005;32192349;;;;;

In the literature, there is evidence that people overweight research evidence when framed in neuroscience findings. In this paper, we present the findings of the first investigation of the impact of an AI frame on the perceived credibility of educational research evidence. In an experimental study, we allocated 605 participants including educators to one of three conditions in which the same educational research evidence was framed within one of: AI, neuroscience, or educational psychology. The results demonstrate that when educational research evidence is framed within AI research, it is considered as less credible in comparison to when it is framed instead within neuroscience or educational psychology. The effect is still evident when the subjects' familiarity with the framing discipline is controlled for. Furthermore, our results indicate that the general public perceives AI to be: less helpful in assisting us to understand how children learn, lacking in adherence to scientific methods, and to be less prestigious compared to neuroscience and educational psychology. Considering the increased use of AI technologies in Educational settings, we argue that there should be significant attempts to recover the public image of AI being less scientifically robust and less prestigious than educational psychology and neuroscience. We conclude the article suggesting that AI in Education community should attempt to be more actively engaged with key stakeholders of AI and Education to help mitigate such effects.;;;;;Cukurova, Mutlu/0000-0001-5843-4854;;;;;;;;;;;;1560-4292;1560-4306;;;;JUN;2020;30;2;;;;;205;235;;10.1007/s40593-019-00188-w;;;;;;;WOS:000543402100001;;;;;;

Not all the authors in the Special Issue were speakers at the event, but this collection provides a carefully selected, representative collection of articles and essays which address the questions and disturbances that drove the event's concept, those being, as articulated in the event description: How are machines being used in contemporary capitalism to perpetuate control and to intensify power relations at work? Theorising how this occurs through discussions about the physical machine, the calculation machine and the social machine, the workshop was designed to re-visit questions about how quantification and measure both human and machinic become entangled in the social and how the incorporation and absorption of workers as appendages within the machine as Marx identified, where artificial intelligence and the platform economy dominate today's discussions in digitalised work research.Stemming from Marxist critical theory, questions of money, time, space are also revisited in the Special Issues articles, as well as less debated concepts in rhythmanalysis and a revival of historically frequently discussed issues such as activities on the shop floor, where a whole range of semi-automated and fully automated methods to manage work through numeration without, necessarily, remuneration continue.

J;Altenried, M;;;;Altenried, Moritz;;;The platform as factory: Crowdwork and the hidden labour behind artificial intelligence;CAPITAL AND CLASS;;;;;;;;;;;;This article analyses crowdwork platforms where various forms of digital labour are outsourced to digital workers across the globe. The labour of these workers is, among other things, a crucial component in the production, development and support of artificial intelligence. Crowdwork platforms are an extreme example of new forms of automated measurement, management and control of labour allowing, in turn, for the creation of hyperflexible and highly scalable workforces. Particularly on so-called microtask platforms, work is characterised by decomposition, standardisation, automated management and surveillance, as well as algorithmically organised cooperation between a great number of workers. Analysing these platforms as a paradigmatic example of an emerging digital Taylorism, the article goes on to argue that this allows the platforms to assemble a deeply heterogeneous set of workers while bypassing the need to spatially and subjectively homogenise them. These platforms create a global on-demand workforce, working in their private homes or Internet cafes. As a result, crowdwork taps into labour pools hitherto almost inaccessible to wage labour. The second part of the article investigates this tendency by looking at two sets of workers: women shouldering care responsibilities, who now can work on crowdwork platforms while performing domestic labour, as well as digital workers in the Global South. While there are clear specifics of digital crowdwork, it is also an expression of broader transformations within the world of work, concerning, for example, new forms of algorithmic management just as the return of very old forms of exploitation such as the piece wage.;;;;;Altenried, Moritz/0000-0001-7152-335X;;;;;;;;;;;;0309-8168;2041-0980;;;;JUN;2020;44;2;;;SI;;145;158;;10.1177/0309816819899410;;;;;;;WOS:000542247700002;;;;;;
J;Moore, PV;;;;Moore, Phoebe, V;;;The mirror for (artificial) intelligence in capitalism;CAPITAL AND CLASS;;;;;;;;;;;;'The mirror for (artificial) intelligence in capitalism' expands on the historical episodes outlined in the article by Engster and Moore in the current Special Issue, to develop the historical materialist critique of the history of ideas leading up to and during the eras of artificial intelligence, but also as a way to critique the contemporary moment where machines are ascribed autonomous intelligence. Specifically, the history of the ideational manufacturing of human intelligence demonstrates a pattern of interest in calculation and computation, intelligent human and machinic behaviours that are, not surprisingly, ideologically aligned with capitalism. The simultaneous series of machinic and technological invention and related experiments shows how machines not only facilitate the processes of normalisation of what is considered intelligent behaviours, via both human and machinic intelligence, but also facilitate and enable the integration of capitalism into everyday work and life. Intelligent behaviours are identified as the capacity for quantification and measure and are limited to aspects of thinking and reasoning that can provide solutions to, for example, obstacles in the production and extraction of surplus value, based on the specific postulations and assumptions highlighted in this piece. Today, ideas of autonomous machinic intelligence, seen in the ways artificial intelligence is incorporated into workplaces outlined in the sections below, facilitate workplace relations via intelligent behaviours that are assistive, prescriptive, descriptive, collaborative, predictive and affective. The question is, given these now autonomous forms of intelligence attributed to machines, who/what is looking in the mirror at whose/which reflection?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0309-8168;2041-0980;;;;JUN;2020;44;2;;;SI;;191;200;;10.1177/0309816820902040;;;;;;;WOS:000542247700005;;;;;;

However, therealways alreadyhas been an artificial intelligence in power in, on the one hand, technical machines and the social machine money, and on the other, humans, making both sides (machines and humans), an interface of their mutual capitalist socialisation.

The disease as at the point of writing this paper has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The application of mathematical models, artificial intelligence, big data, and similar methodologies are potential tools to predict the extent of the spread and effectiveness of containment strategies to stem the transmission of this disease. In societies with constrained data infrastructures, modeling and forecasting COVID-19 becomes an extremely difficult endeavor. Nonetheless, we propose an online forecasting mechanism that streams data from the Nigeria Center for Disease Control to update the parameters of an ensemble model which in turn provides updated COVID-19 forecasts every 24 hours. The ensemble combines an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA), Prophet - an additive regression model developed by Facebook, and a Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing model combined with Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH). The outcomes of these efforts are expected to provide academic thrust in guiding the policymakers in the deployment of containment strategies and/or assessment of containment interventions in stemming the spread of the disease in Nigeria (C) 2020 The Author(s).

These data are usually multivariate time series since modern technologies enable the simultaneous acquisition of multiple signals during long periods of time. In this paper we present a dataset containing sensor traces of six data acquisition campaigns performed by autonomous aquatic drones involved in water monitoring. A total of 5.6 h of navigation are available, with data coming from both lakes and rivers, and from different locations in Italy and Spain. The monitored variables concern both the internal state of the drone (e.g., battery voltage, GPS position and signals to propellers) and the state of the water (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity). Data were collected in the context of the EU-funded Horizon 2020 project INTCATCH (http://www.intcatch.eu) which aims to develop a new paradigm for monitoring water quality of catchments. The aquatic drones used for data acquisition are Platypus Lutra boats. Both autonomous and manual drive is used in different parts of the navigation. The dataset is analyzed in the paper Time series segmentation for state-model generation of autonomous aquatic drones: A systematic framework[1] by means of recent time series clustering/segmentation techniques to extract data-driven models of the situations faced by the drones in the data acquisition campaigns. These data have strong potential for reuse in other kinds of data analysis and evaluation of machine learning methods on real-world datasets [2]. Moreover, we consider this dataset valuable also for the variety of situations faced by the drone, from which machine learning techniques can learn behavioral patterns or detect anomalous activities. We also provide manual labeling for some known states of the drones, such as, drone inside/outside the water, upstream/downstream navigation, manual/autonomous drive, and drone turning, that represent a ground truth for validation purposes. Finally, the real-world nature of the dataset makes it more challenging for machine learning methods because it contains noisy samples collected while the drone was exposed to atmospheric agents and uncertain water flow conditions.

Other issues include the legal liability and the attribution of negligence in case of errors. Some of the above-mentioned concerns could be, at least partially, resolved in case the ML software is classified as a 'medical device', a category covered by EU/national provisions. Concluding, the challenge is to understand how sustainable is the regulatory system in relation to the ML innovation and how legal procedures should be revised in order to adapt them to the current regulatory framework.;;;;Bonifazi, Fedele/F-9687-2017;Bonifazi, Fedele/0000-0003-4935-5702;;;;;;;;;;;;0929-0273;1571-8093;;;;JUN;2020;27;3;;;SI;;242;258;;10.1163/15718093-BJA10009;;;;;;;WOS:000542292200005;;;;;;

J;Palmirani, M;;;;Palmirani, Monica;;;Big Data and Knowledge;RIVISTA DI FILOSOFIA DEL DIRITTO-JOURNAL OF LEGAL PHILOSOPHY;;;;;;;;;;;;We intend to investigate the relationship between big data and artificial intelligence from the perspective of the right to explanation introduced by art. 22 GDPR, while also relying on the concepts of explicability and knowability. In the current debate, too much emphasis falls on algorithm transparency and less on the dataset. From a technical, legal, and philosophical perspective there is no right to arrive at a different independent opinion and to contradict the machine's decision if there is no transparency in the data that factored into the automated decision. In particular, counterfactual reasoning makes it necessary to change the antecedents in order to verify the consequents. This paper investigates the nature of big data, metadata, statistic and synthetic data, personal and nonpersonal data for demonstrating that explanation is a dynamic activity making it necessary to know the entire workflow from data to process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2280-482X;;;;;JUN;2020;9;1;;;;;73;91;;10.4477/97021;;;;;;;WOS:000541842900008;;;;;;
J;Pagallo, U;;;;Pagallo, Ugo;;;Algorithms and Knowability;RIVISTA DI FILOSOFIA DEL DIRITTO-JOURNAL OF LEGAL PHILOSOPHY;;;;;;;;;;;;The essay examines current discussions on how algorithms work from a normative view point. In particular, the attention is drawn to both the right to explanation enshrined in Art. 22 (3) of the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the principle of explainability discussed in today's institutional initiatives on the ethical principles of artificial intelligence (AI). The intent of the analysis is twofold. On the one hand, the aim is to show how, for any kind of knowledge of the algorithm or calculation program at stake, there is a sufficiently clear legal framework to establish liability in the event of damage. On the other hand, the goal is to specify which new principles and rights should complement the current regulatory framework, in order to address the ethical and legal challenges that algorithms pose in terms of knowability, explainability and responsibility for their design and use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2280-482X;;;;;JUN;2020;9;1;;;;;93;106;;10.4477/97022;;;;;;;WOS:000541842900009;;;;;;
J;Romeo, F;;;;Romeo, Francesco;;;Fairness and Predictive Justice. A Path from Machine Learning to the Concept of Law;RIVISTA DI FILOSOFIA DEL DIRITTO-JOURNAL OF LEGAL PHILOSOPHY;;;;;;;;;;;;The crisis of effectiveness of the past decades has been at the same a crisis in the predictability of the citizen's action and in the predictability of the legal response. The new ICT and AI studies, crossed with cognitive sciences have allowed the transformation of man, crossing him or hybridizing him with the result of the researches: the world of the inanimate comes to life and man is mixed with it, it is this double junction, this cultural chiasma, the central point of today. Framing legal science in this methodology can open up a different understanding of the concept of law. If we consider, for instance, the natural law theory, the three roots of natural law change: the nature of the thing changes, the nature of law changes and human nature also changes. On the other hand, law theorized as science has become more plausible, and it would give full meaning to legal predictivity, so legal statements would have, like scientific statements, their own predictive content on the occurrence of future events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2280-482X;;;;;JUN;2020;9;1;;;;;107;123;;10.4477/97023;;;;;;;WOS:000541842900010;;;;;;

Yet, medical professionals are reluctant to reap potential benefits of technology and the reason behind this phenomenon is ambiguous. This study aims to highlight current critical conditions in public healthcare hospitals in Pakistan, and how IoT will add value in healthcare services effectiveness through mobile computing and also to indicate current concepts that may add value in over-all smart healthcare system. According to available information, study to on AI enabled M-IoT network-based healthcare system specially in developing countries to address healthcare problems are rarely known. This study empirically analyzed the factors that influence IoT based smart healthcare devices adoption in Pakistan. In understand the phenomenon, Partial Least Square Equation Model (PLS SEM) was used to understand the relational influence of performance expectance, effort expectance, and social influence over behavior to use through intention to use the technology supported by Unified Theory of Acceptance Technology (UTAUT) assumptions. The results show that clinicians are reluctant to use technology though the results also reveal that same clinicians have positive influence of performance and effort expectations on their intention to use technology that leads the actual behavior of using the technology. Though, this research is among few to beacon upon urgent focus of public healthcare management in developing countries. Yet, new research is lacking far behind to facilitate methods to opt for M-IoT healthcare devices powered by AI.;;;;;Massan, Shafiq-ur-Rehman/0000-0001-6548-6513;;;;;;;;;;;;2254-4143;;;;;JUN-SEP;2020;9;2;;;;;87;111;;10.17993/3ctecno/2020.v9n2e34.87-111;;;;;;;WOS:000541847600004;;;;;;

Although numerous physical modeling techniques have been implemented for the prediction of mechanical strength using equations, several empirical efforts are necessitated to evaluate specific constants for different models. To address this issue, numerous recent studies have employed artificial neural networks for the prediction of mechanical properties based on the material composition and process conditions; however, majority of these works have been limited applications due to the extensive number of input parameter combinations of chemical compositions. Microstructure is a good feature to understand mechanical properties because it incorporates the effects of material composition and process conditions. The complex combination of material composition and process parameters determines the microstructure of steel. In this study, the information on microstructural volume fraction is utilized for the prediction of tensile strength, yield strength, and yield ratio via artificial neural networking. Various combinations of PF (polygonal ferrite), AF (acicular ferrite), GB (granular bainite), BF (bainitic ferrite), and M (martensite) are investigated for the prediction of yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and yield of high strength steel via back-propagation linear regression and neural network based algorithm. The effects of each microstructure on the three mechanical properties were successfully predicted by employing back-propagation linear regression. A deep learning algorithm with hyper-parameter tuning and cross-validation enabled high accuracy in predicting experimental data with mean absolute percentage errors of 6.59% and 10.78% for the validation and test sets, respectively. These studies can open a new avenue for applying the microstructural design effects to find optimum yield strength, tensile strength, and yield ratio of high strength steel.";;;;Moon, Seung Ki/A-2047-2019;"Moon, Seung Ki/0000-0002-2249-7500; Kim, Moobum/0000-0002-1084-2338; Shin, Da Seul/0000-0002-2435-6891";;;;;;;;;;;;2589-1529;;;;;JUN;2020;11;;;;;;;;100699;10.1016/j.mtla.2020.100699;;;;;;;WOS:000541718400004;;;;;;

The main method was a questionnaire using the Likert method. We analysed how artificial intelligence affects human potential. We revealed the degree of dependence of socio-cultural aspects of the society development on artificial intelligence, identified threats and risks posed by artificial intelligence. Also, the nature of the impact of artificial intelligence on religious activities was determined. The hypothesis was put forward: the influence of artificial intelligence on society is diverse, multifaceted with positive and negative biases, the depth and nature of the impact of which have not been fully studied by Islamic religious figures. The public is concerned about the risks of harming people and society. The advantage of this article is to identify the structure of Muslim views on the nature of the impact of artificial intelligence on society, as well as to identify the ratio of positive and negative aspects of its influence. For the first time the authors examined the attitude of imams to artificial intelligence according to given indicators. The obtained results can serve as the basis for further research in the issues of the correct and humanistic use of artificial intelligence in the social sphere.

The analysis of the debate shows two main problems: the conceptual problem arises from the absence of agreement on the definition of AI; and the functional problem derives from the different relevance given to the technical, ethical and legal components. There is a clear prevalence of the former, an insistent invocation of ethical aspects and little attention to legal discourse. From a legal standpoint, two issues must be distinguished: the application of AI to the study and practice of law and the regulation of AI. The model of AI regulation is approached from different methodological perspectives that confirm the need to adopt a proactive and open, non-formalist approach to the organisation of its governance. The study of practice shows, however, that very few States have adopted strategies or action plans in this area. In the international framework, most of the initiatives are located in organizations or forums participated by technologically developed countries. The international legal system must activate universal mechanisms, norms and procedures to respond to this situation and to the global challenge of AI governance.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1697-5197;;;;;JUN;2020;;39;;;;;;;;10.17103/reei.39.07;;;;;;;WOS:000540792300005;;;;;;

We explore its potential IPC benefits in epidemiology, laboratory infection diagnosis, and hand hygiene.Recent FindingsAI has the potential to detect transmission events during outbreaks or predict high-risk patients, enabling development of tailored IPC interventions. AI offers opportunities to enhance diagnostics with objective pattern recognition, standardize the diagnosis of infections with IPC implications, and facilitate the dissemination of IPC expertise. AI hand hygiene applications can deliver behavior change, though it requires further evaluation in different clinical settings. However, staff can become dependent on automatic reminders, and performance returns to baseline if feedback is removed.SummaryAdvantages for IPC include speed, consistency, and capability of handling infinitely large datasets. However, many challenges remain; improving the availability of high-quality representative datasets and consideration of biases within preexisting databases are important challenges for future developments. AI in itself will not improve IPC; this requires culture and behavior change. Most studies to date assess performance retrospectively so there is a need for prospective evaluation in the real-life, often chaotic, clinical setting. Close collaboration with IPC experts to interpret outputs and ensure clinical relevance is essential.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1534-6250;;;;JUN;2020;12;2;;;;;135;144;;10.1007/s40506-020-00216-7;;;;;;;WOS:000541677900004;32218708;;;;;

The recognition of people from the faces in images arouses great interest in the scientific community, partly because of the application interests but also because of the challenge that this represents for artificial vision algorithms. They must be able to cope with the great variability of the aspects of the faces themselves as well as the variations of the shooting parameters (pose, lighting, haircut, expression, background, etc.).

CNN based classification helps decision making in a prompt manner with high precision. CNNs are a subset of deep learning which is a branch of Artificial Intelligence. The main advantage of CNNs compared to other deep learning algorithms is that they require minimal pre-processing. In the proposed disease detection system, two medical image datasets consisting of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and chest X-ray images of 1-5 year-old children are considered and used as inputs. The medical images are processed and classified using CNN and various performance measuring parameters such as accuracy, loss, and training time are measured. The system is then implemented in hardware, where the testing is done using the trained models. The result shows that the validation accuracy obtained in the case of the eye dataset is around 90% whereas in the case of lung dataset it is around 63%. The proposed system aims to help medical professionals to provide a diagnosis with better accuracy thus helping in reducing infant mortality due to pneumonia and allowing finding the severity of eye disease at an earlier stage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2241-4487;1792-8036;;;;JUN;2020;10;3;;;;;5769;5774;;;;;;;;;WOS:000539950000031;;;;;;

At the same time, the unstoppable computerization of advanced industrial societies demands the use of these machines in a growing number of domains. The conjunction of both phenomena gives rise to a control problem on AI that in this paper we analyze by dividing the issue into two.

J;Bradley, P;;;;Bradley, Patrick;;;Risk management standards and the active management of malicious intent in artificial superintelligence;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;The likely near future creation of artificial superintelligence carries significant risks to humanity. These risks are difficult to conceptualise and quantify, but malicious use of existing artificial intelligence by criminals and state actors is already occurring and poses risks to digital security, physical security and integrity of political systems. These risks will increase as artificial intelligence moves closer to superintelligence. While there is little research on risk management tools used in artificial intelligence development, the current global standard for risk management, ISO 31000:2018, is likely used extensively by developers of artificial intelligence technologies. This paper argues that risk management has a common set of vulnerabilities when applied to artificial superintelligence which cannot be resolved within the existing framework and alternative approaches must be developed. Some vulnerabilities are similar to issues posed by malicious threat actors such as professional criminals and terrorists. Like these malicious actors, artificial superintelligence will be capable of rendering mitigation ineffective by working against countermeasures or attacking in ways not anticipated by the risk management process. Criminal threat management recognises this vulnerability and seeks to guide and block the intent of malicious threat actors as an alternative to risk management. An artificial intelligence treachery threat model that acknowledges the failings of risk management and leverages the concepts of criminal threat management and artificial stupidity is proposed. This model identifies emergent malicious behaviour and allows intervention against negative outcomes at the moment of artificial intelligence's greatest vulnerability.;;;;;Bradley, Patrick/0000-0001-7733-9465;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;JUN;2020;35;2;;;;;319;328;;10.1007/s00146-019-00890-2;;;;;;;WOS:000539242900004;;;;;;

Interestingly, in the study of how humans perceive these artificial entities, science has mainly taken an anthropocentric perspective (i.e., how distant from humans are these agents). Considering people's fears and expectations from robots and artificial intelligence, they tend to be simultaneously afraid and allured to them, much as they would be to the conceptualisations related to the divine entities (e.g., gods). In two experiments, we investigated the proximity of representation between artificial entities (i.e., artificial intelligence and robots), divine entities and natural entities (i.e., humans and other animals) at both an explicit (Study 1) and an implicit level (Study 2). In the first study, participants evaluated these entities explicitly on positive and negative attitudes. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that participants' representation of artificial intelligence, robots and divine entities were similar, while the representation of humans tended to be associated with that of animals. In the second study, participants carried out a word/non-word decision task including religious semantic-related words and neutral words after the presentation of a masked prime referring to divine entities, artificial entities and natural entities (or a control prime). Results showed that after divine and artificial entity primes, participants were faster to identify religious words as words compared to neutral words arguing for a semantic activation. We conclude that people make sense of the new entities by relying on already familiar entities and in the case of artificial intelligence and robots, people appear to draw parallels to divine entities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;JUN;2020;35;2;;;;;329;341;;10.1007/s00146-019-00902-1;;;;;;;WOS:000539242900005;;;;;;

What is new, on a relative scale, is the notion that artificial intelligence can possess citizenship-a concept reserved only for humans, as it presupposes the idea of possessing civil duties and protections. Where there are several decades' worth of writing on the concept of the legal status of computational artificial artefacts in the USA and elsewhere, it is surprising that law makers internationally have come to a standstill to protect our silicon brainchildren. In this essay, it will be assumed that future artificial entities, such as Sophia the Robot, will be granted citizenship on an international scale. With this assumption, an analysis of rights will be made with respect to the needs of a non-biological intelligence possessing legal and civic duties akin to those possessed by humanity today.

But, aside from the great hopes and promises associated with artificial intelligence, there are a number of challenges, shortcomings and even limitations of the technology. For one, these challenges arise from methodological and epistemological misconceptions about the capabilities of artificial intelligence. Secondly, they result from restrictions of the social context in which the development of applications of machine learning is embedded. And third, they are a consequence of current technical limitations in the development and use of artificial intelligence.

In this paper, an all-pay contest model is developed to derive implications for public policy to avoid such an outcome. It is established that, in a winner-takes-all race, where players must invest in R&D, only the most competitive teams will participate. Thus, given the difficulty of AGI, the number of competing teams is unlikely ever to be very large. It is also established that the intention of teams competing in an AGI race, as well as the possibility of an intermediate outcome (prize), is important. The possibility of an intermediate prize will raise the probability of finding the dominant AGI application and, hence, will make public control more urgent. It is recommended that the danger of an unfriendly AGI can be reduced by taxing AI and using public procurement. This would reduce the pay-off of contestants, raise the amount of R&D needed to compete, and coordinate and incentivize co-operation. This will help to alleviate the control and political problems in AI. Future research is needed to elaborate the design of systems of public procurement of AI innovation and for appropriately adjusting the legal frameworks underpinning high-tech innovation, in particular dealing with patenting by AI.;;;;Naude, Wim/E-3812-2017;Naude, Wim/0000-0003-2496-6945;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;JUN;2020;35;2;;;;;367;379;;10.1007/s00146-019-00887-x;;;;;;;WOS:000539242900008;;;;;;
J;Robbins, S;;;;Robbins, Scott;;;AI and the path to envelopment: knowledge as a first step towards the responsible regulation and use of AI-powered machines;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;With Artificial Intelligence (AI) entering our lives in novel ways-both known and unknown to us-there is both the enhancement of existing ethical issues associated with AI as well as the rise of new ethical issues. There is much focus on opening up the 'black box' of modern machine-learning algorithms to understand the reasoning behind their decisions-especially morally salient decisions. However, some applications of AI which are no doubt beneficial to society rely upon these black boxes. Rather than requiring algorithms to be transparent we should focus on constraining AI and those machines powered by AI within microenvironments-both physical and virtual-which allow these machines to realize their function whilst preventing harm to humans. In the field of robotics this is called 'envelopment'. However, to put an 'envelope' around AI-powered machines we need to know some basic things about them which we are often in the dark about. The properties we need to know are the: training data, inputs, functions, outputs, and boundaries. This knowledge is a necessary first step towards the envelopment of AI-powered machines. It is only with this knowledge that we can responsibly regulate, use, and live in a world populated by these machines.;;;;;Robbins, Scott/0000-0002-5338-295X;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;JUN;2020;35;2;;;;;391;400;;10.1007/s00146-019-00891-1;;;;;;;WOS:000539242900010;;;;;;
J;"Chandra, A; Ghosh, S";;;;"Chandra, Anant; Ghosh, Satyajit";;;Smart Sankey picturization for energy management systems in India;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;India's energy demand is predicted to rise by 135% within a span of 20 years. Coping up with surging energy demands requires several reforms in both renewable and non-renewable sectors. Factors such as rising population, reduction in the cost of renewable energy technology and their effect on the nation's GDP, can make policy making a herculean task and the justification for such policies, quite opaque to the public. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology can help decision makers to quickly draw conclusions from voluminous datasets under different heads. However, AI results need to be post-processed so that they are easily understood by the layperson. This paper focuses on using Sankey diagrams as a post-processing tool for AI systems. Policy formulation often requires an overall assessment of energy sources, production pathways, end used destinations and wastage encountered-these can be easily visualized with a Sankey diagram. For this work, a Sankey protocol was written out in a form where a prompt asks the user to supply information through a spreadsheet interfaced with a customized mobile app-a first anywhere in the subcontinent. India's mobile sector is vibrant, and the paper presents a enabling the user to have a handle on the dynamics of energy distribution locally. The app gives an instant feel of the apportioned energy across grids, the projected changes for the next decade, the efficiency and feasibility of each sector and lastly a telling visual representation showing the main strengths and weaknesses in the energy sector.;;;;;Chandra, Anant/0000-0002-3633-7364;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;JUN;2020;35;2;;;;;401;407;;10.1007/s00146-019-00900-3;;;;;;;WOS:000539242900011;;;;;;
J;Nawar, H;;;;Nawar, Haytham;;;Collective bread diaries: cultural identities in an artificial intelligence framework;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;The complex relationship between the current advancement of technology, including the wide scope of settings at which machinery plays substantial roles, and the cultural, historical, and political realities that have long existed across the history of mankind, is one that deserves absolute attention and exploration. This interconnection has been investigated in light of bread, and the meaning it signifies to people from all over the world. Drawing on the commonly unnoticed value of bread, and the everlasting impregnable imprint it has always had on revolutions throughout history, Collective Bread Diaries came to being as an interactive art project, employing the artificial intelligence of the MTurk platform in its investigation of bread as one's peculiar voice and political statement. The author amongst other participants was granted the opportunity to draw and share personal visual representations of bread, eventually forming an array of visual diaries, each peculiar to its creator and each reflecting the cultural significance of the place from which it originated. The results are exceptionally reproduced drawings by a machine, with no apparent threads to culture, tradition, or history, emphasizes the conscious perception of one's distinct identity. A number of 100 distinct drawings were machine-generated featuring various bread types. The process eventually investigates one's perception of cultural identity, by exploring the cultural, socio-political, and religious threads that have long been weaved into the definition of bread across history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;JUN;2020;35;2;;;;;409;416;;10.1007/s00146-019-00882-2;;;;;;;WOS:000539242900012;;;;;;

With massive amounts of data collected from citizens, devices, and traditional sources such as routine and well-established censuses, urban areas across the world have - for the first time in history the opportunity to monitor and manage their urban infrastructure in real-time. This simultaneously provides previously unimaginable opportunities to shape the future of cities, but also gives rise to new ethical challenges. This paper provides a transdisciplinary synthesis of the developments, opportunities, and challenges for urban management and planning under this ongoing 'digital revolution' to provide a reference point for the largely fragmented research efforts and policy practice in this area. We consider both top-down systems engineering approaches and the bottom-up emergent approaches to coordination of different systems and functions, their implications for the existing physical and institutional constraints on the built environment and various planning practices, as well as the social and ethical considerations associated with this transformation from non-digital urban management to data-driven urban management.;;;;van Dijk, Justin/P-1678-2019;van Dijk, Justin/0000-0001-5496-425X;;;;;;;;;;;;2226-5856;2589-0360;;;;JUN;2020;9;2;;;;;140;150;;10.1016/j.jum.2019.12.001;;;;;;;WOS:000539275100002;;;;;;

Due to their ability to conduct an entire military operation without the technical need for human control, the possible deployment of such systems in armed conflict scenarios raises relevant ethical issues and legal questions. After briefly pointing out the main arguments in favor of and contrary to the use of AWS, we will argue that, for different reasons, both knowledge-based and machine-learning systems are intrinsically unable to respect international humanitarian law in as far as its norms have been construed in order to be applied by subjects endowed with human faculties, which we think can be well identified by looking at the theory of human judgement developed by Hannah Arendt. Also, from an international criminal law perspective, their deployment is at odds with the concepts of responsibility and criminal liability and could thus lead to a lack of accountability for military action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1720-2396;;;;;JUN;2020;52;1;;;;;263;283;;10.1415/96875;;;;;;;WOS:000539044100016;;;;;;

More specifically, it seeks to respond to Singularity-when machines reach a level of intelligence that would put into question the privileged position humanity enjoys asimago Dei. Employing the Bemba notion of mystico-relationality in dialogue with the concepts of the created co-creator and Christ the Key, it argues for the possibility of AI participating inimago Dei. The findings show that imaging is a fluid, participatory activity that aims at likeness, but also social harmony. It also argues that God is the only original creator, humans are created creators, and that every aspect of visible existence, including AI, is inherently divine imaging. However, strong imaging is only attainable based on the only One and True Image-Christ, whose union of the material and the divine means that all creation can image, excluding nothing, even AI.;;;;;Kaunda, Chammah Judex/0000-0001-6879-6330;;;;;;;;;;;;0591-2385;1467-9744;;;;JUN;2020;55;2;;;;;327;343;;10.1111/zygo.12598;;;;;;;WOS:000539449700004;;;;;;

I extend these discussions and argue that some kind of You-speaking for artifacts is needed to combat rampant consumption and reduction of the world to pure utility. But, I equally suggest that there are limitations to applying the I-You relation to artifacts precisely when doing so keeps us from having genuine relationships with other people as outlined by psychologist Sherry Turkle.

V/AR effectively bring the digital world of machines, robots, and artificial agents to our senses while entailing the transposition of human activity and presence into the digital world of artificial agents and machine forms of intelligence. The intersection of humans and machines in this shared space brings humans and machines into ontological continuity as informational entities in a totalizing informational environment, which subsumes both cyber and physical space in an artificially constructed virtual world.

As related research gathered momentum and resources, the topic made impressions on public discourse. One effect was increasingly pointed emphasis on AI in popular narratives. Although considerably earlier thematic examples may be located, we can observe swelling and generally pessimistic threads of speculation in science fiction of the 1950s and 1960s. This discussion identifies some pertinent science fiction texts from that period, alongside public discussion arising from contemporary research. One consistent theme is human receptiveness to thenuminous, and the capacity to ascribe personality and even divinity to sufficiently impressive manifestations, even artificial ones. Science fiction has long contemplated such reactions, prefiguring today's anticipations of AIs that might abruptly develop themselves beyond any possible human comprehension or control. This body of exploratory projections is a useful resource for the engineers and philosophers currently grappling with realistic prospects for Western humanity's shifting conception of itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0591-2385;1467-9744;;;;JUN;2020;55;2;;;;;382;408;;10.1111/zygo.12602;;;;;;;WOS:000539449700008;;;;;;

The diagnosis of breast cancer is an essential task; however, diagnosis can include 'detection' and 'interpretation' errors. Studies to reduce these errors have shown the feasibility of using convolution neural networks (CNNs). This narrative review presents recent studies in diagnosing mammographic malignancy investigating the accuracy and reliability of these CNNs. Databases including ScienceDirect, PubMed, MEDLINE, British Medical Journal and Medscape were searched using the terms 'convolutional neural network or artificial intelligence', 'breast neoplasms [MeSH] or breast cancer or breast carcinoma' and 'mammography [MeSH Terms]'. Articles collected were screened under the inclusion and exclusion criteria, accounting for the publication date and exclusive use of mammography images, and included only literature in English. After extracting data, results were compared and discussed. This review included 33 studies and identified four recurring categories of studies: the differentiation of benign and malignant masses, the localisation of masses, cancer-containing and cancer-free breast tissue differentiation and breast classification based on breast density. CNN's application in detecting malignancy in mammography appears promising but requires further standardised investigations before potentially becoming an integral part of the diagnostic routine in mammography.";;;;;Reed, Warren/0000-0002-8937-2198;;;;;;;;;;;;2051-3895;2051-3909;;;;JUN;2020;67;2;;;;;134;142;;10.1002/jmrs.385;;;;;;;WOS:000538310400006;32134206;;;;;
J;Jenkins, D;;;;Jenkins, David;;;The Limits of Education and Technology for Ethical Thinking;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SINO-WESTERN STUDIES;;;;;;;;;;;;"In this article the present author explores briefly the benefits and limits of education and technology for ethical thinking. Due to the time limits imposed by the seminar this article was prepared for, he speaks only generally about education and restricts his comments to technology to computer technology. He also limits his analysis of ethical thinking to four major western theories concerning judgement about right and wrong, good and evil. They arc: Utilitarianism, deontological (duty) ethics, existential ethics, and virtue ethics. The author finds in the case of each ethical theory some advantages in the use of educational strategies or computer technology to support ethical thinking; but he thinks that education and computer technology fail to solve the fundamental problems of each ethical theory. The reason for this failure is not the limits of education or computer technology themselves but the inherent difficulties of each of these ethical theories. However advanced may be the thinking of artificial intelligence or the sophistication of educational programs, the same difficulties that people confront in trying to utilize these ethical theories also confront artificial intelligence and those who believe that ethical issues can be solved by a little more education. In the end, neither education nor computer technology can help us choose from among these theories the one that functions best or to use any of them as a final ethical justification for judgements of right and wrong, good and evil.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1799-8204;2242-2471;;;;JUN;2020;18;;;;;;25;38;;;;;;;;;WOS:000537987700002;;;;;;

In the current study, three types of linear time series models including autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) were employed to estimate short-term (i.e., daily) and long-term (i.e., monthly) wind speeds. The required data were gathered, respectively, from the Tabriz and Zahedan stations in the northwest and southeast of Iran. The MA models outperformed the AR and ARMA on the both daily and monthly scales. Daily and monthly wind speed values, as a function of lagged wind speed data, were then estimated using two machine learning models of random forests (RF) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). It was found that the RF and MARS provided similar results; however, RF performed slightly better than the MARS. Finally, the stand-alone time series and machine learning models were coupled to improve the accuracy of the wind speed estimation. Accordingly, the hybrid RF-AR, RF-MA, RF-ARMA, MARS-AR, MARS-MA, and MARS-ARMA models were implemented. It was concluded that, the hybrid models outperformed the stand-alone RF and MARS for both short- and long-term wind speed estimations where, the RF-AR and MARS-AR hybrid models provided the best performances.

A case study for the port of Antwerp;CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY;;;;;;;;;;;;Major changes in the job market are currently observed, among others a consequence of the introduction of information and communication technology (ICT) in port areas. The question is how important the mismatch is between supply and demand for jobs, skills and competences, as a consequence among others of the above-mentioned changes. From literature, general trends in the job market are identified and their impact is translated to new trends in ports. The aim of the research is threefold: mapping the eventual mismatch in terms of employment, examining whether technological innovations (ICT and automation) have an impact on the future professions and specialisations and identifying the skills that need to be developed by education. The case is the maritime and non-maritime cluster in the port of Antwerp looking forward at a 2030 horizon. Next to conducting a literature review, the study analyses quantitative data on the characteristics of employment in the port of Antwerp provided by the social security administration. Moreover a qualitative analysis through interviews was done in close cooperation with the port community, including port companies, port associations and educational institutes. The main results are threefold. First, the appearance of a polarised job market, where due to ICT introduction and automation, a lot of middle-paid paperwork jobs disappear. Second, that jobs on the floor will be more and more assisted by robotics and data applications and analysis, including use of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Third, that management jobs will become more and more complex with multi-skilling becoming a key.

Autonomous approaches can be very convenient. However, in certain domains, e.g., in the medical domain, it is necessary to enable a domain expert to understand, why an algorithm came up with a certain result. Consequently, the field of Explainable AI (xAI) rapidly gained interest worldwide in various domains, particularly in medicine. Explainable AI studies transparency and traceability of opaque AI/ML and there are already a huge variety of methods. For example with layer-wise relevance propagation relevant parts of inputs to, and representations in, a neural network which caused a result, can be highlighted. This is a first important step to ensure that end users, e.g., medical professionals, assume responsibility for decision making with AI/ML and of interest to professionals and regulators. Interactive ML adds the component of human expertise to AI/ML processes by enabling them to re-enact and retrace AI/ML results, e.g. let them check it for plausibility. This requires new human-AI interfaces for explainable AI. In order to build effective and efficient interactive human-AI interfaces we have to deal with the question of how to evaluate the quality of explanations given by an explainable AI system. In this paper we introduce our System Causability Scale to measure the quality of explanations. It is based on our notion of Causability (Holzinger et al. in Wiley Interdiscip Rev Data Min Knowl Discov 9(4), 2019) combined with concepts adapted from a widely-accepted usability scale.;;;;Holzinger, Andreas/E-9530-2010;Holzinger, Andreas/0000-0002-6786-5194;;;;;;;;;;;;0933-1875;1610-1987;;;;JUN;2020;34;2;;;SI;;193;198;;10.1007/s13218-020-00636-z;;;;;;;WOS:000537757400007;32549653;;;;;

To allow for dose escalation within the target without compromising the dose to critical structures, proper immobilization needs to be combined with (internal) motion monitoring. Metallic fiducials, as applied in prostate, liver or pancreas treatments, are not suitable in clinical practice for spine SBRT. However, the latest advances in Deep Learning (DL) allow for fast localization of the vertebrae as landmarks. Acquiring projection images during treatment delivery allows for instant 2D position verification as well as sequential (delayed) 3D position verification when incorporated in a Digital TomoSynthesis (DTS) or Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). Upgrading to an instant 3D position verification system could be envisioned with a stereoscopic kilovoltage (kV) imaging setup. This paper describes a fast DL landmark detection model for vertebra (trained in-house) and evaluates its accuracy to detect 2D motion of the vertebrae with the help of projection images acquired during treatment. The introduced motion consists of both translational and rotational variations, which are detected by the DL model with a sub-millimeter accuracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1120-1797;1724-191X;;;;JUN;2020;74;;;;;;66;73;;10.1016/j.ejmp.2020.04.029;;;;;;;WOS:000537810100008;32422577;;;;;

Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews were carried out with seven employees who were using the new technology. Survey data was gathered from 109 employees who had not, at the time of the research, used the new technology. Findings The introduction of AI considerably improved the speed and efficiency of the work processes. The research found that those employees who had used the new technology were positive about its effects, indicating that it was easy to use, robust and highly productive. A proportion of employees who had not, at the time of the research, used the new system, were less sure that it would improve their ability to do their job. Implications for introducing such a system and for employee training are discussed. Research limitations/implications This is a relatively small sample in one organisation; further research should be undertaken to assess whether these findings apply more widely. Practical implications If these attitudes are found elsewhere, there are a number of simple, practical suggestions for how to introduce AI into similar work processes. Originality/value The use of AI is a topic attracting increasing interest and speculation, but there is as yet little empirical research on factors affecting its introduction and use.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0019-7858;1758-5767;;;;;2020;52;2;;;;;121;130;;10.1108/ICT-10-2019-0097;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000537469500001;;;;;;

The possibility of introduction of the Perceptron model in the industrial enterprise management with the purpose of identification of bottlenecks in the functionality of business activity and improvement of procedures of decision-making in the framework of creation of the program of development and technical re-equipment of the enterprise is proven. The authors offered an organizational and economic mechanism of operation of an industrial enterprise, which includes new means of implementation of managerial actions through the use of a matrix of assessment of the level of implementation of cognitive technologies. The method of determining priority directions for the implementation of cognitive technologies at an enterprise was developed based on the results of the assessment of the depth of penetration of cognitive technologies and the result obtained from their implementation, which additionally takes into account the resource ratio of the implemented technologies defined as the ratio of estimates of the actual level of competencies to what is needed to work with new cognitive technologies, which allows to obtain the planned economic and organizational effect.;;;;"Kuzior, Aleksandra/C-5949-2017; Kwilinski, Aleksy/B-7526-2017";"Kwilinski, Aleksy/0000-0001-6318-4001; Kuzior, Aleksandra/0000-0001-9764-5320";;;;;;;;;;;;2299-0461;2450-5781;;;;JUN;2020;28;2;;;;;133;138;;10.2478/mspe-2020-0020;;;;;;;WOS:000537527300010;;;;;;

(2007). The referred methods include machine learning techniques, face and/or voice recognition, temperature mapping, and other, within the artificial intelligence domain. These techniques are being applied to solve problems in socially and politically sensitive areas such as crime prevention and justice management, crowd management, and emotion analysis, just to mention a few. However, dissimilar predictions can be found nowadays as the result of the application of these methods resulting in misclassification, for example for the case of conviction risk assessment Office of Probation and Pretrial Services (2011) or decision-making process when designing public policies Lange (2015). The goal of this paper is to identify current gaps on fairness achievement within the context of predictive systems in artificial intelligence by analyzing available academic and scientific literature up to 2020. To achieve this goal, we have gathered available materials at the Web of Science and Scopus from last 5 years and analyzed the different proposed methods and their results in relation to the bias as an emergent issue in the Artificial Intelligence field of study. Our tentative conclusions indicate that machine learning has some intrinsic limitations which are leading to automate the bias when designing predictive algorithms. Consequently, other methods should be explored; or we should redefine the way current machine learning approaches are being used when building decision making/decision support systems for crucial institutions of our political systems such as the judicial system, just to mention one.";;;;Varona, Daniel/AAG-6467-2019;Varona, Daniel/0000-0003-2992-527X;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00146-020-00996-y;;JUN 2020;;;;;WOS:000537387500001;;;;;;

To do that, the ventilator should be in synchrony with patient's respiratory rhythm. The complexity of such interplay leads to several concerning issues that clinicians should be able to recognize. Asynchrony between the patient and the ventilator may induce several deleterious effects that require a proper physiological understanding to recognize and manage them. Different tools have been developed and proposed beyond the careful analysis of the ventilator waveforms to help clinicians in the decision-making process. Moreover, appropriate handling of asynchrony requires clinical skills, physiological knowledge, and suitable medication management. New technologies and devices are changing our daily practice, from automated real-time recognition of asynchronies and their distribution during mechanical ventilation, to smart alarms and artificial intelligence algorithms based on physiological big data and personalized medicine.

J;Tien, JM;;;;Tien, James M.;;;Convergence to real-time decision making;FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT;;;;;;;;;;;;Real-time decision making reflects the convergence of several digital technologies, including those concerned with the promulgation of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies that underpin real-time actions. More specifically, real-time decision making can be depicted in terms of three converging dimensions: Internet of Things, decision making, and real-time. The Internet of Things include tangible goods, intangible services, ServGoods, and connected ServGoods. Decision making includes model-based analytics (since before 1990), information-based Big Data (since 1990), and training-based artificial intelligence (since 2000), and it is bolstered by the evolving real-time technologies of sensing (i.e., capturing streaming data), processing (i.e., applying real-time analytics), reacting (i.e., making decisions in real-time), and learning (i.e., employing deep neural networks). Real-time includes mobile networks, autonomous vehicles, and artificial general intelligence. Central to decision making, especially real-time decision making, is the ServGood concept, which the author introduced in an earlier paper (2012). It is a physical product or good encased by a services layer that renders the good more adaptable and smarter for a specific purpose or use. Addition of another communication sensors layer could further enhance its smartness and adaptiveness. Such connected ServGoods constitute a solid foundation for the advanced products of tomorrow which can further display their growing intelligence through real-time decisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2095-7513;2096-0255;;;;JUN;2020;7;2;;;SI;;204;222;;10.1007/s42524-019-0040-5;;;;;;;WOS:000536728500005;;;;;;

Additionally, analysis and test studies have been carried out for Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS) Algorithm. The aim of the study is to measure the mimicking a natural ecosystem success of symbiotic operators. Thus, problems in the search process have been discovered and operators' design mistakes have been revealed as a case study of the developed testing and analyzing method. Moreover, ways of realizing a precise neighborhood search (intensification) and getting rid of the local minimum (increasing diversification) have been explored. Important information that enhances the performance of operators in the search process has been achieved through experimental studies.

This task is important for researchers and practitioners because many of BRICS' ICs lack PCRs from reputable rating agencies such as Moody's, Standard and Poor's, and Fitch. This paper aimed at filling the gap in the existing research as insufficient efforts were focused on prediction of PCRs of ICs from the entire BRICS IC community. The modeled variables are credit ratings (CRs) of 208 BRICS' ICs assigned by Moody's at the year-end from 2006 to 2016. The sample included 1217 observations. Financial explanatory variables included companies' revenue, operating profitability, interest coverage ratio, debt/book capitalization, and cash flow debt coverage. Non-financial explanatory variables included dummies for home region, industry, affiliation with the state, and a set of macroeconomic data of IC's home countries. The set of statistical methods included linear discriminant analysis (LDA), ordered logit regression (OLR), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF). The resulting models were checked for in-sample and out-of-sample predictive fit. Our findings revealed that among considered methods of artificial intelligence models (AI), SVM, ANN, and RF outperformed LDA and OLR by predictive power. On testing sample, AI gave on average 55% of precise results and up to 99% with an error within one rating grade; RF demonstrated the best outcome (58% and 100%). Conversely, LDA and OLR on average gave only 37% of precise results and up to 70% with an error within one grade. LDA and OLR also gave higher share of Type I errors (overestimation of ratings) than that of AI. Therefore, AI should have higher practical application than DA and OLR for predicting the ratings of BRICS ICs.";;;;Grishunin, Sergei/ABC-9522-2020;;;;;;;;;;;;;1309-422X;2147-429X;;;;JUN;2020;10;2;;;;;333;348;;10.1007/s40822-019-00130-4;;;;;;;WOS:000534803300008;;;;;;

However, ultrasound has several limitations to consider, including operator dependency and lack of a viable contrast agent. Fortunately, new technological advances show promise in resolving these issues. Ultra-high resolution ultrasound enables imaging of the nerve at the fascicular level. Shear wave elastography imaging can provide measures of tissue stiffness that can act as a surrogate measure of nerve and muscle health. Photoacoustic imaging may overcome neuromuscular ultrasound's current lack of contrast agents to detect inflammation and other functional changes within nerve and muscle, while artificial intelligence stands to address operator dependency and improve diagnostic imaging. The basic principles of each of these technologies are discussed along with current research and potential future applications in neuromuscular imaging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0148-639X;1097-4598;;;;JUN;2020;61;6;;;;;719;725;;10.1002/mus.26819;;;;;;;WOS:000532852800012;32012298;;;;;

We developed an artificial intelligence deep learning algorithm (DLA) to detect chronic kidney disease from retinal images, which could add to existing chronic kidney disease screening strategies. Methods We used data from three population-based, multiethnic, cross-sectional studies in Singapore and China. The Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study (SEED, patients aged >= 40 years) was used to develop (5188 patients) and validate (1297 patients) the DLA. External testing was done on two independent datasets: the Singapore Prospective Study Program (SP2, 3735 patients aged >= 25 years) and the Beijing Eye Study (BES, 1538 patients aged >= 40 years). Chronic kidney disease was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min per 1.73m(2). Three models were trained: 1) image DLA; 2) risk factors (RF) including age, sex, ethnicity, diabetes, and hypertension; and 3) hybrid DLA combining image and RF. Model performances were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Findings In the SEED validation dataset, the AUC was 0.911 for image DLA (95% CI 0.886-0.936), 0.916 for RF (0.891-0.941), and 0.938 for hybrid DLA (0.917-0.959). Corresponding estimates in the SP2 testing dataset were 0.733 for image DLA (95% CI 0.696-0.770), 0.829 for RF (0.797-0.861), and 0.810 for hybrid DLA (0.776-0.844); and in the BES testing dataset estimates were 0.835 for image DLA (0.767-0.903), 0.887 for RF (0.828-0.946), and 0.858 for hybrid DLA (0.794-0.922). AUC estimates were similar in subgroups of people with diabetes (image DLA 0.889 [95% CI 0.850-0.928], RF 0.899 [0.862-0.936], hybrid 0.925 [0.893-0.957]) and hypertension (image DLA 0.889 [ 95% CI 0.860-0.918], RF 0.889 [0.860-0.918], hybrid 0.918 [0.893-0.943]). Interpretation A retinal image DLA shows good performance for estimating chronic kidney disease, underlying the feasibility of using retinal photography as an adjunctive or opportunistic screening tool for chronic kidney disease in community populations.

In this paper we propose a method aimed to discriminate between malicious and legitimate samples in mobile environment and to identify the belonging malware family and the variant inside the family. We obtain gray-scale images directly from executable samples and we gather a set of features from each image to build several classifiers. We experiment the proposed solution on a data-set of 50,000 Android (24,553 malicious among 71 families and 25,447 legitimate) and 230 Apple (115 samples belonging to 10 families) real-world samples, obtaining promising results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2263-8733;;;;;JUN;2020;16;2;;;;;157;171;;10.1007/s11416-019-00346-7;;;;;;;WOS:000532736000004;;;;;;

As a result, GPUs have been widely applied in computationally intensive applications such as image processing, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. Because these applications can be modeled by multiple GPU kernels, some of which might even be dependent, it is essential to identify an efficient method for scheduling dependent kernels on GPU cores. Simply observing kernel dependencies by executing them in sequence results in performance degradation. Furthermore, dependent kernels generally need to share data. Consequently, without properly scheduling dependent kernels, unnecessary memory accesses and copies will be generated. Neural network model environments include many operators that are suitable for both parallel and dependent kernels. This paper proposes an efficient and clear method for creating a framework to analyze the ONNX (open neural network exchange) model and find the pattern of dependent kernels, which can then be used for scheduling with the GPU architecture. The preliminary experimental results show that this technique improves the overall performance by 8% and reduces the cache miss rate by 14% on average by combining neural network operators and appropriate memory policies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1383-7621;1873-6165;;;;JUN;2020;106;;;;;;;;101712;10.1016/j.sysarc.2020.101712;;;;;;;WOS:000531020300001;;;;;;

J;Andreotta, AJ;;;;Andreotta, Adam J.;;;The hard problem of AI rights;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;In the past few years, the subject of AI rights-the thesis that AIs, robots, and other artefacts (hereafter, simply 'AIs') ought to be included in the sphere of moral concern-has started to receive serious attention from scholars. In this paper, I argue that the AI rights research program is beset by an epistemic problem that threatens to impede its progress-namely, a lack of a solution to the 'Hard Problem' of consciousness: the problem of explaining why certain brain states give rise to experience. To motivate this claim, I consider three ways in which to ground AI rights-namely: superintelligence, empathy, and a capacity for consciousness. I argue that appeals to superintelligence and empathy are problematic, and that consciousness should be our central focus, as in the case of animal rights. However, I also argue that AI rights is disanalogous from animal rights in an important respect: animal rights can proceed without a solution to the 'Hard Problem' of consciousness. Not so with AI rights, I argue. There we cannot make the same kinds of assumptions that we do about animal consciousness, since we still do not understand why brain states give rise to conscious mental states in humans.;;;;;Andreotta, Adam/0000-0003-1458-2657;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00146-020-00997-x;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000536422900003;32836903;;;;;
J;"Stephan, KD; Klima, G";;;;"Stephan, Karl D.; Klima, Gyula";;;Artificial intelligence and its natural limits;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;An argument with roots in ancient Greek philosophy claims that only humans are capable of a certain class of thought termed conceptual, as opposed to perceptual thought, which is common to humans, the higher animals, and some machines. We outline the most detailed modern version of this argument due to Mortimer Adler, who in the 1960s argued for the uniqueness of the human power of conceptual thought. He also admitted that if conceptual thought were ever manifested by machines, such an achievement would contradict his conclusion. We revisit Adler's criterion in the light of the past five decades of artificial-intelligence (AI) research, and refine it in view of the classical definitions of perceptual and conceptual thought. We then examine two well-publicized examples of creative works (prose and art) produced by AI systems and show that evidence for conceptual thought appears to be lacking in them. Although clearer evidence for conceptual thought on the part of AI systems may arise in the near future, especially if the global neuronal workspace theory of consciousness prevails over its rival, integrated information theory, the question of whether AI systems can engage in conceptual thought appears to be still open.;;;;;Klima, Gyula/0000-0002-1597-7039;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00146-020-00995-z;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000536422900002;;;;;;

Design/methodology/approach The timeline from 2010 to 2020 was adopted. Data were extracted from five databases and were compiled in the software Zotero. Based on defined criteria, 260 productions were identified. The interrelation and metric presentation of the data from these studies were done in the software VosViewer. Subsequently, were selected only free access papers, resulting in 64 publications. From these, the authors chose six empirical studies for a descriptive analysis based on specific criteria. Findings The range of hardware and software platforms has stimulated the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality and artificial intelligence (AI) resources in corporative training. The use of management tools such as voice of customer (VOC) and quality function deployment (QFD), can support those responsible for instructional planning. The literature presented important elements that should be considered for the proper planning of an e-learning training: learner: feedback, control of self-learning process, classification of cultural profiles in the case of courses in which participants are geographically distant and training management: content and delivery mode of instruction. Originality/value The authors selected six empirical studies that presented models, systems or experiences on training planning to support decisions in this area. This study contributes to the area of T&D showing an updated context of practices for the implementation of training systems that have been adopted in several countries. The authors present quantitative indicators of scientific production using two additional software to support the bibliometric review, namely, Zotero and VosViewer.

The purpose of this study is to exploit AI for the highest strategic-level task of government: to develop an AI-based public sector data analytics methodology for supporting policymaking for one of the most serious and large-scale challenges that governments repeatedly face, the economic crises that lead to economic recessions (though the proposed methodology is of much more general applicability). Design/methodology/approach A public sector data analytics methodology has been developed, which enables the exploitation of existing public and private sector data, through advanced processing of them using a big data-oriented AI technique, all-relevant feature selection, to identify characteristics of firms as well as their external environment that affect (positively or negatively) their resilience to economic crisis. Findings A first application of the proposed public sector data analytics methodology has been conducted, using Greek firms' data concerning the economic crisis period 2009-2014, which has led to interesting conclusions and insights, revealing factors affecting the extent of sales revenue decrease in Greek firms during the above crisis period and providing a first validation of the methodology used in this study. Research limitations/implications This paper contributes to the advancement of two emerging highly important, for the society, but minimally researched, digital government research domains: public sector data analytics (and especially policy analytics) and government exploitation of AI. It exploits an AI feature selection algorithm, the Boruta all-relevant variables identification algorithm, which has been minimally exploited in the past for public sector data analytics, to support the design of public policies for addressing one of the most serious and large-scale economic challenges that governments repeatedly face: the economic crises. Practical implications The proposed methodology allows the identification of characteristics of firms as well as their external environment that affect positively or negatively their resilience to economic crisis. This enables a better understanding of the kinds of firms that are more strongly hit by the crisis, which is quite useful for the design of public policies for supporting them; and at the same time reveals firms' practices, resources, capabilities, etc. that enhance their ability to cope with economic crisis, to design policies for promoting them through educational and support activities. Social implications This methodology can be very useful for the design of more effective public policies for reducing the negative impacts of economic crises on firms, and therefore mitigating their negative consequences for the society, such as unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. Originality/value This study develops a novel approach to the exploitation of public and private sector data, based on a minimally exploited, for such purposes, AI technique (all-relevant feature selection), to support the design of public policies for addressing one of the most threatening disruptions that modern economies and societies repeatedly face, the economic crises.";;;;Maragoudakis, Manolis/AAS-8112-2020;Maragoudakis, Manolis/0000-0001-7701-0141;;;;;;;;;;;;1750-6166;1750-6174;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1108/TG-11-2019-0113;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000537512800001;;;;;;

I draw on the literature on modelintelligibilityin the philosophy of science to offer some benchmarks for theinterpretabilityof artificial neural networks (ANN's) used as a predictive tool in neuroscience. Following two case studies on the use of ANN's to model motor cortex and the visual system, I argue that the benefit of providing the scientist with understanding of the brain trades off against the predictive accuracy of the models. This trade-off between prediction and understanding is better explained by a non-factivist account of scientific understanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0039-7857;1573-0964;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s11229-020-02713-0;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000556655900003;;;;;;

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown to be effective in this population, but it is not widely available to those who need it. Objective: This study aimed to better understand BCSs' experiences with insomnia and to explore the feasibility and acceptability of delivering CBT-I using a virtual assistant (Amazon Alexa). Methods: We first conducted a formative phase with 2 focus groups and 3 in-depth interviews to understand BCSs' perceptions of insomnia as well as their interest in and comfort with using a virtual assistant to learn about CBT-I. We then developed a prototype incorporating participant preferences and CBT-I components and demonstrated it in group and individual settings to BCSs to evaluate acceptability, interest, perceived feasibility, educational potential, and usability of the prototype. We also collected open-ended feedback on the content and used frequencies to describe the quantitative data. Results: We recruited 11 BCSs with insomnia in the formative phase and 14 BCSs in the prototype demonstration. In formative work, anxiety, fear, and hot flashes were identified as causes of insomnia. After prototype demonstration, nearly 79% (11/14) of participants reported an interest in and perceived feasibility of using the virtual assistant to record sleep patterns. Approximately two-thirds of the participants thought lifestyle modification (9/14, 64%) and sleep restriction (9/14, 64%) would be feasible and were interested in this feature of the program (10/14, 71% and 9/14, 64%, respectively). Relaxation exercises were rated as interesting and feasible using the virtual assistant by 71% (10/14) of the participants. Usability was rated as better than average, and all women reported that they would recommend the program to friends and family. Conclusions: This virtual assistant prototype delivering CBT-I components by using a smart speaker was rated as feasible and acceptable, suggesting that this prototype should be fully developed and tested for efficacy in the BCS population. If efficacy is shown in this population, the prototype should also be adapted for other high-risk populations.;;;;;"Scott, Remle/0000-0002-6423-459X; Greenberg, Daniel/0000-0002-8637-2731";;;;;;;;;;;;2369-1999;;;;;MAY 26;2020;6;1;;;;;;;e15859;10.2196/15859;;;;;;;WOS:000535909900001;32348274;;;;;

Deep neural network architectures has number of layers to conceive the features well, by itself. The hyperparameter tuning plays a major role in every dataset which has major effect in the performance of the training model. Due to the large dimensionality of data it is impossible to tune the parameters by human expertise. In this paper, we have used the CIFAR-10 Dataset and applied the Bayesian hyperparameter optimization algorithm to enhance the performance of the model. Bayesian optimization can be used for any noisy black box function for hyperparameter tuning. In this work Bayesian optimization clearly obtains optimized values for all hyperparameters which saves time and improves performance. The results also show that the error has been reduced in graphical processing unit than in CPU by 6.2% in the validation. Achieving global optimization in the trained model helps transfer learning across domains as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1868-6478;1868-6486;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s12530-020-09345-2;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000535386600001;;;;;;

This omission is all the more surprising when considering that recent statistics suggest that 61% of firms employing B2B salespeople engage in sales enablement initiatives. The purpose of this agenda setting piece is to introduce the concept of sales enablement to a broader academic audience, and to outline a research agenda for sales researchers. Based on semi-structured, qualitative interviews with practitioners, we propose a framework that suggests that sales enablement can be best understood as a firm-wide strategic initiative that incorporates the 3 Ps of People, Process, and Performance- to deliver value to seller firms and customers alike.

J;Anthony, B;;;;Anthony, Bokolo, Jr.;;;A case-based reasoning recommender system for sustainable smart city development;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;With the deployment of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the needs of data and information sharing within cities, smart city aims to provide value-added services to improve citizens' quality of life. But, currently city planners/developers are faced with inadequate contextual information on the dimensions of smart city required to achieve a sustainable society. Therefore, in achieving sustainable society, there is need for stakeholders to make strategic decisions on how to implement smart city initiatives. Besides, it is required to specify the smart city dimensions to be adopted in making cities smarter for sustainability attainment. But, only a few methods such as big data, internet of things, cloud computing, etc. have been employed to support smart city attainment. Thus, this study integrates case-based reasoning (CBR) as an artificial intelligence technique to develop a recommender system towards promoting smart city planning. CBR provides suggestions on smart city dimensions to be adopted by city planners/decision-makers in making cities smarter and sustainable. Accordingly, survey data were collected from 115 respondents to evaluate the applicability of the implemented CBR recommender system in relation to how the system provides best practice recommendations and retaining of smart city initiatives. Results from descriptive and exploratory factor analyses suggest that the developed system is applicable in supporting smart city adoption. Besides, findings from this study are expected to provide valuable insights for practitioners to develop more practical strategies and for researchers to better understand smart city dimensions.;;;;Anthony, Bokolo/K-9280-2016;Anthony, Bokolo/0000-0002-7276-0258;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s00146-020-00984-2;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000534189200001;;;;;;
J;Melancon, AA;;;;Melancon, Andree-Anne;;;What's wrong with drones? Automatization and target selection;SMALL WARS AND INSURGENCIES;;;;;;;;;;;;Developments in artificial intelligence have ignited many debates on the use of autonomous weapons and 'killer robots.' However, before autonomous attack decisions can be explored, issues related to target selection need to be considered. Focusing the discussion on drones and artificial intelligence overshadows more fundamental issues. This paper therefore argues that the main ethical problem raised by autonomous drones do not come from the weapon system or technology itself. Instead, they stem from challenges of target identification. Thus, asking 'what's wrong with drones?' is misleading as it focusses on the technology instead of the primary issue of target selection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0959-2318;1743-9558;;;;MAY 18;2020;31;4;;;SI;;801;821;;10.1080/09592318.2020.1743486;;;;;;;WOS:000544476100006;;;;;;

As the development of Human-Machine Teaming relates to artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities there also exists an area of concern pertaining to reliability and confidence, particularly in the heat of battle. Also known as Manned-Unmanned Teaming, Human-Machine Teaming attempts to engender trust and collaborative partnerships with robots and algorithms. Clearly the prospect of LAWS in recent times, or so-called 'killer robots,' has raised questions relating to the degree such devices can be trusted to select and engage targets without further human intervention. Aside from examining the 'trust factor,' the article also considers security threats posed by both state and non-state actors and the complicit yet inadvertent role multinational corporations play in such developments where civilian technology is modified for dual-purposes. The effectiveness of government regulation over AI, including whether AI can be 'nationalised' for national security reasons, will also be examined as part of AI non-proliferation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0959-2318;1743-9558;;;;MAY 18;2020;31;4;;;SI;;822;850;;10.1080/09592318.2020.1743485;;;;;;;WOS:000544476100007;;;;;;

Simultaneously the Chinese state is undertaking a major 'anti-secession and counter-terrorism' campaign in Xinjiang using a variety of high-technology means: artificial intelligence, big data, wireless connectivity, autonomous systems and robotics. The demand and supply sides seem to be in sync, suggesting Chinese private security companies will soon use a suite of advanced information technology systems with a proven employment doctrine across much of Central Asia, South Asia and Africa.

J;Smith, KT;;;;Smith, Katherine Taken;;;Marketing via smart speakers: what should Alexa say?;JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING;;;;;;;;;;;;A smart speaker is a wireless device with artificial intelligence that can be activated through voice command. The artificial intelligence interacts in the form of a virtual personal assistant, such as Amazon's Alexa. Companies are currently creating voice applications for smart speakers that allow consumers to use the personal assistant to perform tasks, such as acquiring information and ordering products. This is the dawn of a new type of interaction between brands and consumers, a new touchpoint. Brands need to catch the vision and create content for this new technology, content that is useful in the buying process. The purpose of this study is to determine what types of marketing messages people find acceptable on smart speakers. Based on the findings, a cognitive message strategy is effective with smart speakers. The paper presents three types of executional frameworks that are best suited for the design of a cognitive message: authoritative, testimonial, and slice-of-life. The overriding requirement for marketing on smart speakers is that the message must provide value to the listener.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0965-254X;1466-4488;;;;MAY 18;2020;28;4;;;;;350;365;;10.1080/0965254X.2018.1541924;;;;;;;WOS:000536202500005;;;;;;

Furthermore, the automation part of EDM is closer to the concept of artificial intelligence. Due to the wide applications of artificial intelligence in assorted fields, the authors are curious about the state-of-art of related applications in Education. Design/methodology/approach This study focused on systematically reviewing 1,219 EDM studies that were searched from five digital databases based on a strict search procedure. Although 33 reviews were attempted to synthesize research literature, several research gaps were identified. A comprehensive and systematic review report is needed to show us: what research trends can be revealed and what major research topics and open issues are existed in EDM research. Findings Results show that the EDM research has moved toward the early majority stage; EDM publications are mainly contributed by actual analysis category; machine learning or even deep learning algorithms have been widely adopted, but collecting actual larger data sets for EDM research is rare, especially in K-12. Four major research topics, including prediction of performance, decision support for teachers and learners, detection of behaviors and learner modeling and comparison or optimization of algorithms, have been identified. Some open issues and future research directions in EDM field are also put forward.

Furthermore, it assists in decreasing the technical complexity and sophistication of different systems to the facility management (FM) team. Design/methodology/approach This research exploits artificial intelligence (AI) in FM operations through proposing a new system that uses a deep learning pre-trained model for transfer learning. The model can identify new MEP elements through image classification with a deep convolutional neural network using a support vector machine (SVM) technique under supervised learning. Also, an expert system is developed and integrated with an Android application to the proposed system to identify the required maintenance for the identified elements. FM team can reach the identified assets with bluetooth tracker devices to perform the required maintenance. Findings The proposed system aids facility managers in their tasks and decreases the maintenance costs of facilities by maintaining, upgrading, operating assets cost-effectively using the proposed system. Research limitations/implications The paper considers three fire protection systems for proactive maintenance, where other structural or architectural systems can also significantly affect the level of service and cost expensive repairs and maintenance. Also, the proposed system relies on different platforms that required to be consolidated for facility technicians and managers end-users. Therefore, the authors will consider these limitations and expand the study as a case study in future work.

Summary: The Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee within each health system is responsible for evaluating medication requests for formulary addition. Members of the pharmacy staff prepare the drug monograph or a medication use evaluation (MUE) and allocate precious clinical resources to review patient charts to assess efficacy and value. We explored a novel approach to evaluate the value of our intravenous acetaminophen (IV APAP) formulary admittance. This new methodology, called rapid cycle analytics, can assist hospitals in meeting and/or exceeding the minimum criteria of formulary maintenance as defined by the Joint Commission Standards. In this particular study, we assessed the effectiveness of IV APAP in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures. We assessed the correlation to same-stay opioid utilization, average length of inpatient stay and post anesthesia care unit (PACU) time. Conclusion: We were able to explore and improve our organization's approach in evaluating medications by partnering with an external analytics expert to help organize and normalize our data in a more robust, yet time efficient manner. Additionally, we were able to use a significantly larger external data set as a point of reference. Being able to perform this detailed analytical exercise for thousands of encounters internally and using a data warehouse of over 130 million patients as a point of reference in a short time has improved the depth of our assessment, as well as reducing valuable clinical resources allocated to MUEs to allow for more direct patient care. This clinically real-world and data-rich analytics model is the necessary foundation for using Artificial or Augmented Intelligence (AI) to make real-time formulary and drug selection decisions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0018-5787;1945-1253;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1,85787E+13;10.1177/0018578720918341;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000534058800001;;;;;;

Although the United States Catholic Conference of Bishops' Ethical and Religious Directives for Health Care Services (ERDs) address collaborations between US Catholic healthcare providers and other entities, the ERDs do not adequately address the novel concerns seen in EHR data sharing for AI development. Neither does the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rule. This article describes ethical and social problems observed in recent patient data-sharing collaborations with AI companies and analyzes them in light of the guiding principles of the ERDs as well as the 2020 Rome Call to AI Ethics (RCAIE) document recently released by the Vatican. While both the ERDs and RCAIE guiding principles can inform future collaborations, we suggest that the next revision of the ERDs should consider addressing data sharing and AI more directly. Electronic health record data sharing with artificial intelligence developers presents unique ethical and social challenges that can be addressed with updated United States Catholic Conference of Bishops' Ethical and Religious Directives and guidance from the Vatican's 2020 Rome Call to AI Ethics document.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0024-3639;2050-8549;;;;NOV;2020;87;4;;;SI;;471;481;UNSP 0024363920922690;10.1177/0024363920922690;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000533101900001;33100395;;;;;

At the same time, the powers of AI have been rising so strongly that it is no longer obvious that AI applications (whether in the law or elsewhere) help promoting a good society; in fact they are sometimes harmful. Hence many argue that safeguards are needed for AI to be trustworthy, social, responsible, humane, ethical. In short: AI should be good for us. But how to establish proper safeguards for AI? One strong answer readily available is: consider the problems and solutions studied in AI & Law. AI & Law has worked on the design of social, explainable, responsible AI aligned with human values for decades already, AI & Law addresses the hardest problems across the breadth of AI (in reasoning, knowledge, learning and language), and AI & Law inspires new solutions (argumentation, schemes and norms, rules and cases, interpretation).

Traditionally, VSD methods assume that we can identify relevant values during the design phase of new technologies. The underlying assumption is that there is only epistemic uncertainty about which values will be impacted by a technology. VSD methods suggest that one can predict which values will be affected by new technologies by increasing knowledge about how values are interpreted or understood in context. In contrast, digital platforms exhibit a novel form of uncertainty, namely, ontological uncertainty: even with full information and overview, it cannot be foreseen what users or developers will do with digital platforms. Hence, predictions about which values are affected might not hold. In this paper, we suggest expanding VSD methods to account for value dynamism resulting from ontological uncertainty. Our expansions involve (1) extending VSD to the entire lifecycle of a platform, (2) broadening VSD through the addition of reflexivity, i.e. second-order learning about what values to aim at, and (3) adding specific tools of moral sandboxing and moral prototyping to enhance such reflexivity. While we illustrate our approach with a short case study about ride-sharing platforms such as Uber, our approach is relevant for other technologies exhibiting ontological uncertainty as well, such as machine learning, robotics and artificial intelligence.;;;;"van de Poel, Ibo/ABB-9362-2020; de Reuver, Mark/N-4848-2016";"de Reuver, Mark/0000-0002-6302-7185; /0000-0002-9553-5651";;;;;;;;;;;;1388-1957;1572-8439;;;;SEP;2020;22;3;;;;;257;267;;10.1007/s10676-020-09537-z;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000532627900001;;;;;;
J;Swanepoel, D;;;;Swanepoel, Danielle;;;The possibility of deliberate norm-adherence in AI;ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY;;;;;;;;;;;;Moral agency status is often given to those individuals or entities which act intentionally within a society or environment. In the past, moral agency has primarily been focused on human beings and some higher-order animals. However, with the fast-paced advancements made in artificial intelligence (AI), we are now quickly approaching the point where we need to ask an important question: should we grant moral agency status to AI? To answer this question, we need to determine the moral agency status of these entities in society. In this paper I argue that to grant moral agency status to an entity, deliberate norm-adherence must be possible (at a minimum). In this paper I argue that, under the current status quo, AI systems are unable to meet this criterion. The novel contribution this paper makes to the field of machine ethics is first, to provide at least two criteria with which we can determine moral agency status. We do this by determining the possibility of deliberate norm-adherence through examining the possibility of deliberate norm-violation. Second, to show that establishing moral agency in AI suffer the same pitfalls as establishing moral agency in constitutive accounts of agency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1388-1957;1572-8439;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s10676-020-09535-1;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000532627900002;;;;;;

Design/methodology/approach The timeline from 2010 to 2020 was adopted. Data were extracted from five databases and were compiled in the software Zotero. Based on defined criteria, 260 productions were identified. The interrelation and metric presentation of the data from these studies were done in the software VosViewer. Subsequently, were selected only free access papers, resulting in 64 publications. From these, we chose 6 empirical studies for a descriptive analysis based on specific criteria. Findings The range of hardware and software platforms has stimulated the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) resources in corporative training. The use of management tools, such as Voice of Customer (VOC) and Quality Function Deployment (QFD), can support those responsible for instructional planning. The literature presented important elements that should be considered for the proper planning of an e-Learning training: learner: feedback, control of self-learning process, classification of cultural profiles in the case of courses in which participants are geographically distant and training management: content and delivery mode of instruction. Originality/value We selected 6 empirical studies that presented models, systems or experiences on training planning to support decisions in this area. This article contributes to the area of T&D showing an updated context of practices for the implementation of training systems that have been adopted in several countries.

This suggests that humans engage in cognitive anthropomorphism: expecting AI to have the same nature as human intelligence. This mismatch presents an obstacle to appropriate human-AI interaction. To delineate this mismatch, I examine known properties of human classification, in comparison with image classifier systems. Based on this examination, I offer three strategies for system design that can address the mismatch between human and AI classification: explainable AI, novel methods for training users, and new algorithms that match human cognition.;;;;;Mueller, Shane/0000-0001-7418-4592;;;;;;;;;;;;1064-8046;2169-5083;;;;JUL;2020;28;3;;;SI;;12;19;UNSP 1064804620920870;10.1177/1064804620920870;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000532315100001;;;;;;

Given that values vary across cultures, an additional ethical challenge is to ensure that these AI systems are not developed according to some unquestioned but questionable assumption of universal norms but are in fact compatible with the societies in which they operate. This is particularly pertinent for AI research and implementation across Africa, a ground where AI systems are and will be used but also a place with a history of imposition of outside values. In this paper, we thus critically examine one proposal for ensuring that decision-making systems are just, fair, and intelligible-that we adopt a principle of explicability to generate specific recommendations-to assess whether the principle should be adopted in an African research context. We argue that a principle of explicability not only can contribute to responsible and thoughtful development of AI that is sensitive to African interests and values, but can also advance tackling some of the computational challenges in machine learning research. In this way, the motivation for ensuring that a machine learning-based system is just, fair, and intelligible is not only to meet ethical requirements, but also to make effective progress in the field itself.;;;;Rosman, Benjamin/ABF-3933-2020;"Carman, Mary/0000-0002-8163-2100; Rosman, Benjamin/0000-0002-0284-4114";;;;;;;;;;;;1388-1957;1572-8439;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s10676-020-09534-2;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000531763000001;;;;;;

It delineates the way in which the Eliza effect is operationalised in AI research even as it is ostensibly demystified, for example, in the writings of Douglas Hofstadter and Joseph Weizenbaum. It then exposes the gendered assumptions embedded in the nomenclature used to name this misperception of the computer as having capabilities equivalent to the human. It traces the genealogy of that nomenclature back through Weizenbaum's ELIZA, to George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion. A close reading of the play is deployed in order to reveal the structural inequities of gender, class, and who or what gets to be human, that are both explored in the play and encoded in the operation and operationalisations of the Eliza effect. It concludes by attending to that operation and operationalisation in relation to today's Virtual Personal Assistant's, and makes a case for the importance of critique in order to expose the inequitable structures of power obscured and compounded by the Eliza effect - both its name, and that which it names.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1479-7585;1740-1666;;;;JAN 2;2020;24;1;;;;;1;15;;10.1080/14797585.2020.1754642;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000533703700001;;;;;;

Despite these environmental threats, the development and creation of new highways is unavoidable. This research was carried out to study the effect of the road on Smith-Wilson evenness index and Simpson diversity index in Khojir National Park. The Land Management Units were created using the ArcGIS software. Using appropriate algorithm in artificial neural network structure and linear regression of species evenness and diversity was modelled. For modelling of species evenness and diversity, factors like bulk density, particle density, moisture content, porosity and distance from the road were used. Finally, considering that the amount of R-2 in artificial neural network method was statistically significant for Smith-Wilson and Simpson (0.54), (0.71) and in the regression method, respectively (0.25), (0.75), was obtained, the neural network model was selected as the optimal model.

Early screening can be critical for successful management of the disease, thus tools implemented within mobile technology to speed up accessibility are becoming more common. This research critically analyses dementia and mild cognitive impartment (MCI) screening tools in terms of their clinical validity & acceptability, efficiency, and performance. We used inclusion and exclusion criteria to search Android and Apple mobile stores, for dementia and MCI screening applications. The comparison of the prevailing apps suggests that no app fulfils the considered evaluation criteria. Hence, the development of dementia screening apps that cover cognitive, memory, and execution domains defined within the neurocognitive disorders for dementia diagnosis of Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), may provide clear clinical benefit as these domains are crucial.

However, for prototype concepts this principle is often too rigid. Blurring the division between conceptual composition and belief update has therefore been suggested (Hampton and Jonsson 2012). Inspired by this idea, we develop a normative account of how belief revision and meaning composition should interact in modifications such as red apple or pet hamster. We do this by combining the well-known selective modification model (Smith et al. Cognitive science 12(4):485-527 1988) with the rules of Bayesian belief update.

In this paper, deformation monitoring data from measured absolute displacements in a tunnel in Greece, excavated at a complex geological system with fractured and loose cataclastic gouge, are used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) for the prediction of crown displacements along the tunnel. A Multi-layered perceptron neural network has been developed to be used as a quick smart tool for deformation behavior prediction (crown displacements) of the tunnel using the monitoring data measurements as target data and input training data from deformation parameters. The same deformation parameters are applied in finite element models (FEM) that simulate generalized sections of the tunnel from which a set of deformation results is obtained. A detailed description of the developed ANN is given and results are shown. Finally, the deformation results from the ANN tool, the FEM models, and the actual field measurements are provided and the potential of the proposed ANN method as a quick tool for tunnel deformation prediction is discussed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1866-9298;1866-928X;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s12518-020-00304-9;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000531150700001;;;;;;

This article addresses this research gap. It offers a literature overview and reports about an empirical study on AI in communications, presenting first insights on how professionals in the field assess the technology. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative cross-national study among 2,689 European communication practitioners investigated four research questions: RQ1 - How much do professionals know about AI and to what extent are they already using AI technologies in their everyday lives? RQ2 - How do professionals rate the impact of AI on communication management? RQ3 - Which challenges do professionals identify for implementing AI in communication management? RQ4 - Which risks do they perceive? Findings Communication professionals revealed a limited understanding of AI and expected the technology to impact the profession as a whole more than the way their organisations or themselves work. Lack of individual competencies and organisations struggling with different levels of competency and unclear responsibilities were identified as key challenges and risks.

As human interaction is increasingly replaced by human-computer and human-robot interaction (HCI and HRI), we occasionally speak and act as though we are blaming or praising various technological devices. While such responses may arise naturally, they are still unusual. Indeed, for some authors, it is the programmers or users-and not the system itself-that we properly hold responsible in these cases. Furthermore, some argue that since directing blame or praise at technology itself is unfitting, designing systems in ways that encourage such practices can only exacerbate the problem. On the other hand, there may be good moral reasons to continue engaging in our natural practices, even in cases involving AI systems or robots. In particular, daily interactions with technology may stand to impact the development of our moral practices in human-to-human interactions. In this paper, we put forward an empirically grounded argument in favor of some technologies being designed for social responsiveness. Although our usual practices will likely undergo adjustments in response to innovative technologies, some systems which we encounter can be designed to accommodate our natural moral responses. In short, fostering HCI and HRI that sustains and promotes our natural moral practices calls for a co-developmental process with some AI and robotic technologies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;DEC;2020;35;4;;;;;885;893;;10.1007/s00146-020-00982-4;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000530957200002;;;;;;

As the world is changing, its needs are changing in the same way and at the same speed. The world has become more digitized now. Moreover, we have a dramatic shift from Education 1.0 to Education 4.0 these days. The world now is practicing the internet of things, cloud storage, cyber-physical system and artificial intelligence. The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that affect the level of motivation toward the integration and implication of Industrial Revolution (IR) 4.0 in the education system of Pakistan by considering the Government policies. Design/methodology/approach For analyzing these factors, 150 research articles were sought out, out of which 84 were chosen for reviewing purpose based on the authentication of and relevance to this study by considering the Pakistani context. All the research articles have been selected from reputed indexed journals from databases (Scopus and Web of Science). Findings The findings of this review suggest that many factors affect the motivation toward integration and implementation of IR 4.0. These factors mainly include human factors, intrinsic values and influencing factors. Moreover, there is no such framework that provides the base to Education 4.0 in Pakistan because the things exist but are not systematic. Educators are motivated, but there are no resources; policies are there, but there is no practice or implementation. Pakistan is lacking in the latest trends related to Education 4.0 and even has no experience because people are used to doing things manually, but technology is the need of this era. Furthermore, the findings of this study will be useful for developing a systematic plan or a framework of the integration and implication of IR 4.0 that ultimately gives rise to Education 4.0 in the education system of Pakistan. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, no other study has been conducted on this topic in Pakistan. Also, there is a very little work done on this topic anywhere else in the world. The world is still exploring the IR 4.0, and our topic is solemnly related to these resolutions. Thus, there is a very little amount of literature related to this study.";;;;;Asad, Muhammad Mujtaba/0000-0001-9532-7054;;;;;;;;;;;;1741-5659;1758-8510;;;;SEP 16;2020;17;4;;;;;337;354;;10.1108/ITSE-02-2020-0022;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000532268400001;;;;;;

However, current on-skin electrodes have poor conformal properties under sweaty condition in real-life because of decreased electrode-skin adhesion with sweat film at the interface. Here, we fabricated biocomposite electrodes based on silk fibroin (SF) through interfacial polymerization, which is applicable on sweaty skin. Interfacial polymerized conductive polypyrrole (PPy) and SF are structurally interlocked and endow the whole electrode with uniform stretchability. Existence of water results in similar Young's modulus of SF to the skin and enhanced interfacial adhesion. It keeps the electrodes conformal to skin under sweaty condition and allows reliable collection of ambulatory electrophysiological signals during sports and sweating. Wearable devices with these electrodes were used to acquire continuous and stable real-time electrocardiography (ECG) signals during running for 2 h. The collected signals can provide information for sports management and are also analyzed by artificial intelligence to show their potential for intelligent human emotion monitoring. Our strategy provides opportunities to record long-term continuous electrophysiological signals in real-life conditions for various smart monitoring systems.;;;;"Chen, Xiaodong/A-4537-2009; Ji, Shaobo/V-8302-2018";"Chen, Xiaodong/0000-0002-3312-1664; Ji, Shaobo/0000-0002-6333-3561; Chaturvedi, Iti/0000-0003-4602-2080";;;;;;;;;;;;;2639-4979;;;;MAY 4;2020;2;5;;;;;478;484;;10.1021/acsmaterialslett.0c00085;;;;;;;WOS:000530657400007;;;;;;
J;Melancon, AA;;;;Melancon, Andree-Anne;;;What's wrong with drones? Automatization and target selection;SMALL WARS AND INSURGENCIES;;;;;;;;;;;;Developments in artificial intelligence have ignited many debates on the use of autonomous weapons and 'killer robots'. However, before autonomous attack decisions can be explored, issues related to target selection needs to be considered. Focussing the discussion on drones and artificial intelligence overshadows more fundamental issues. This paper therefore argues that the main ethical problem raised by autonomous drones do not come from the weapon system or technology itself. Instead, they stem from challenges of target identification. Thus, asking 'what's wrong with drones?' is misleading as it focusses on the technology instead of the primary issue of target selection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0959-2318;1743-9558;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10.1080/09592318.2020.1757915;;MAY 2020;;;;;WOS:000545716300001;;;;;;

The ECG beats give useful information about the status of the monitored heart condition. Up to now, various artificial intelligence-based methods have been proposed for ECG based heart failure detection. These methods were generally based on either time or frequency domain signal processing routines. In this study, we propose a different approach for ECG beat classification. The proposed approach is based on image processing. Thus, the initial step of the proposed work is converting the ECG beat signals to the ECG beat images. To do that, the ECG beat snapshots are initially saved as ECG beat images and then local feature descriptors are considered for feature extraction from ECG beat images. Eight local feature descriptors namely Local Binary Patterns, Frequency Decoded LBP, Quaternionic Local Ranking Binary Pattern, Binary Gabor Pattern, Local Phase Quantization, Binarized Statistical Image Features, CENsus TRansform hISTogram and Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradients are considered for feature extraction. The Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier is used in the classification stage of the study. Linear, Quadratic, Cubic and Gaussian kernel functions are used in the SVM classifier. Five types of ECG beats from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset are considered in experiments and the classification accuracy is used for performance measure. To construct a balanced training and test sets, 5000 and 10,000 ECG beat samples are randomly selected and are used in experiments in tenfold cross-validation fashion. The obtained results show that the proposed method is quite efficient where the calculated accuracy score is 99.9% and the comparisons with the state-of-the-art method show that the proposed method outperforms other methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2047-2501;;;;;MAY 2;2020;8;1;;;;;;;20;10.1007/s13755-020-00110-y;;;;;;;WOS:000529831300001;32373314;;;;;

In this direction, there are, as expected, roles for causality, and explainable artificial intelligence. The latter area not only sheds light on the models, but also on the data that support model construction. There is also room for defining, identifying, and explaining errors in data, in particular, in ML, and also for suggesting repair actions. More generally, explanations can be used as a basis for defining dirty data in the context of ML, and measuring or quantifying them. We think dirtiness as relative to the ML task at hand, e.g., classification.;;;;;Geerts, Floris/0000-0002-8967-2473;;;;;;;;;;;;1936-1955;;;;;MAY;2020;12;2;;;SI;;;;11;10.1145/3386687;;;;;;;WOS:000582595600005;;;;;;

Emphasis will be placed on the findings that point to persistent lower female participation in the field of work, lower wages, and little representation in senior corporate management positions and the public sector. The reviewed studies come mainly from entities leading the lawmaking actions of national governments, namely, the United Nations (UN), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the Development Cooperation Organization. All agree that women face new and complex challenges, such as those brought on by the technological and scientific transformations that are changing the world's labor scenario, in addition to the already existing gaps. Issues such as digitization, automation, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies will further transform society. Such effects could profoundly impact women because, despite being trained in varied branches of knowledge, they are an underrepresented minority in the fastest growing areas, namely, the so-called STEM (the acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Therefore, the above entities suggest actions that prevent the progress made from rapidly eroding and the emergence of modern forms of segregation, displacement, or precarization of women's work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0120-4645;2256-5078;;;;MAY-AUG;2020;36;67;;;;;158;171;;10.25100/cdea.v36i67.8767;;;;;;;WOS:000577861700012;;;;;;

This study examined how factors like number of authors and international collaboration are related to the waiting time (WT) of receiving the first citation. The study further investigates how WT and early citation (EC) could be used as an important indicator for the prediction of long-term scientific impact. For the purpose, we used Web of Science database to collect citation data of the publications from 2008 to 2017 in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) related research fields. For analysis, we used the bibliometric method to examine the number of cited and uncited publications and to find out publication's frequency distribution as per the waiting period. Further, correlation and regression analysis are performed to check the relationship among variables. The analysis results state that collaboration improves citation speed by reducing WT. Moreover, the result shows that publications which receive their first citation early have more chances to attract future citations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2321-6654;2320-0057;;;;MAY-AUG;2020;9;2;;;;;127;135;;10.5530/jscires.9.2.16;;;;;;;WOS:000575768900005;;;;;;

The focus is on the development and use of big data, i.e. large volumes of data that vary in terms of their nature of quality and that can be processed at high speed using big data analytics for a variety of purposes. Law is tasked with facilitating the opportunities associated with big data, but also with warding off or minimising the risks to legally protected individual and collective interests. Of special importance is the protection of rights of freedom, including the right to informational self-determination (data protection). Law also requires innovations. In addition to legal structures, protection through technology is important (such as protection by design/by default). Also necessary are assurances of sufficient transparency and control, as well as judicial protection. In addition, it must be ensured that suitable governance structures are developed. This includes assuring that generally applicable law works in concert with law that specifically targets the handling of digitalisation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2447-5467;;;;MAY-AUG;2020;6;2;;;;;431;506;;10.21783/rei.v6i2.484;;;;;;;WOS:000574645100004;;;;;;

Current neural networks attempt to learn spatial and temporal information as a whole, limiting their abilities to represent large-scale spatial representations over long-range sequences. Here, we introduce a new modelling strategy-'semi-coupled structure' (SCS)-which consists of deep neural networks that decouple the complex spatial and temporal concepts during learning. SCS can learn to implicitly separate input information into independent parts and process these parts separately. Experiments demonstrate that SCS can successfully sequentially annotate the outline of an object in images and perform video action recognition. As an example of sequence-to-sequence problems, SCS can predict future meteorological radar echo images based on observed images. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SCS has the capacity to improve the performance of long short-term memory (LSTM)-like models on large-scale sequential tasks.

Starting from conventional SOMs, Growing SOMs (GSOMs), Growing Grid Networks (GGNs), Incremental Grid Growing (IGG) approach, Growing Neural Gas (GNG) method as well as our two original solutions, i.e., Generalized SOMs with 1-Dimensional Neighborhood (GeSOMs with 1DN also referred to as Dynamic SOMs (DSOMs)) and Generalized SOMs with Tree-Like Structures (GeSOMs with T-LSs) are discussed. They are characterized in terms of (i) the modification mechanisms used, (ii) the range of network modifications introduced, (iii) the structure regularity, and (iv) the data-visualization/data-clustering effectiveness. The performance of particular solutions is illustrated and compared by means of selected data sets. We also show that the proposed original solutions, i.e., GeSOMs with 1DN (DSOMs) and GeSOMS with T-LSs outperform alternative approaches in various complex clustering tasks by providing up to 20% increase in the clustering accuracy. The contribution of this work is threefold. First, algorithm-oriented original computer-implementations of particular SOM's generalizations are developed.

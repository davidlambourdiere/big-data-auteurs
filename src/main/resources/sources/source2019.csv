It is famous for the artistic and complicated ways that letters and words interweave and intertwine to express textual statements - usually quotations from the Quran. These specifications make it probably the hardest of all human writing systems to read. Here, we introduce the challenge of reading Arabic calligraphy using artificial intelligence (AI), a challenge that combines image processing and understanding of texts. We have collected a corpus of 1000 AC images along with annotated quotations from the Quran, preprocessing the images and identifying individual letters using detection methods based on maximally stable extremal regions (MSERs) and sliding windows (SWs). We then collect the identified letters to form bags of extracted letters (BOLs). These BOLs are then used to search for possible quotation from the corpus. Our results show that MSERs outperforms SWs in letter detection. Furthermore, BOL-matching is better than word generation in predicting the correct quotation, with the correct answer found in the list of 10 topmost matches for more than 74% of the 388 test examples.;"[ALSalamah, Seetah; Batista-Navarro, Riza; King, Ross D.] Univ Manchester, Dept Comp Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England";"Batista-Navarro, R; King, RD (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Dept Comp Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England.";"Seetah.alsalamah@gmail.com; riza.batista@manchester.ac.uk; rdking@turing.ac.uk";;;King Saud UniversityKing Saud University;SA would like to thank King Saud University for funding this research.;;26;0;0;1;1;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-33617-2; 978-3-030-33616-5";LECT NOTES COMPUT SC;;;2019;11872;;;;;;293;304;;10.1007/978-3-030-33617-2_30;;;12;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BQ2MN;WOS:000582455000030;;Green Published;;;2020-12-16;

Darknet is an encrypted network technology that uses the internet infrastructure and can only be accessed using special network configuration and software tools to access its contents which are not indexed by search engines. Over the years darknets traditionally are used for criminogenic activities and famously acclaimed to promote cybercrime, procurements of illegal drugs, arms deals, and cryptocurrency markets. In countries with oppressive regimes, censorship of digital communications, and strict policies prompted journalists and freedom fighters to seek freedom using darknet technologies anonymously while others simply exploit it for illegal activities. Recently, MIT's Lincoln Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence augmented a tool that can be used to expose illegal activities behind the darknet. We studied relevant literature reviews to help researchers to better understand the darknet technologies, identify future areas of research on the darknet and ultimately to optimize how data-driven insights can be utilized to support governmental agencies in unraveling the depths of darkent technologies.

Due to the complexity and dynamic nature of driving environments, it is difficult to reliably detect traffic signs with conventional image processing methods. Artificial intelligence in combination with image processing has proven to be a great success to address this problem in recent studies. This paper focuses on the selection of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) based on the application-oriented performance by taking into consideration the mean Average Precision (mAP) and Frames Per Second (FPS) as the major evaluation criteria. Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) is a newly proposed DNN in the literature that has proven to exhibit a balanced tradeoff between mAP and FPS performance measures. This paper starts with a DNN transfer learning and then implements the Faster R-CNN algorithm for the real-time detection and classification of traffic signs using the Robot Operating System (ROS). To reduce the errors due to DNN inaccurate detection, Tesseract is added to detect the text in the identified traffic signs. The German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB) dataset is used in this paper, and additional datasets are created to solve the lack of certain traffic signs in the GTSDB dataset. Simulation with ROS-Gazebo and real-time trials using the Polaris Gem e2 equipped with NVIDIA Drive PX2 demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed integration of DNN with Tesseract in detecting and classifying a wide range of traffic signs.;"[Ravindran, Ratheesh; Santora, Michael J.; Faied, Mariam; Fanaei, Mohammad] Univ Detroit Mercy, Dept Elect & Comp Engn & Comp Sci, Detroit, MI 48221 USA";Fanaei, M (corresponding author), Univ Detroit Mercy, Dept Elect & Comp Engn & Comp Sci, Detroit, MI 48221 USA.;"ravindra@udmercy.edu; santormjl@udmercy.edu; faiedma@udmercy.edu; fanaeimo@udmercy.edu";;Santora, Michael/0000-0001-6889-9516;;;;10;0;0;1;1;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-5584-5;;;;2019;;;;;;;318;323;;10.1109/CSCI49370.2019.00063;;;6;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP9OC;WOS:000569996300056;;;;;2020-12-16;

Several datasets and knowledge representations for question answering, coreference resolution, and inference tasks have been discussed and built by the natural-language processing community. However, these focus on declarative knowledge or factual knowledge describing an entity or event. In contrast, research on reasoning and language understanding with procedural or how-to knowledge, i.e., the knowledge used in completing a task or process (e.g., navigation instructions, recipes, repair guides, etc.), has received less attention. Several procedural knowledge bases, benchmark datasets, and information extraction methods have enabled various natural language understanding tasks with procedural knowledge (also known as procedural knowledge understanding).

In clinical practice HRM is only performed for about 30 minutes with a very standardized protocol. Esophageal motility disorders can cause severe discomfort and symptoms even if they only occur spontaneously. Such temporary motility disorders are often not detectable in conventional HRM. Longterm HRM is a unique way to study the circadian behavior of the esophagus and thus will contribute to a more effective treatment of esophageal motility disorders. Prolonging the time of measurement to a full of 24 hours leads to an exponential increase in data and work, which makes longterm HRM not yet feasible in clinical routine. 40 longterm HRM measurements of patients and healthy volunteers were meticulously tagged by hand and used as training and validation data for our machine learning model. As each longterm HRM dataset consists of at least 155 million datapoints at total amount of 6 billon datapoints big data in medicine can no longer be handled without support by artificial intelligence. Therefore we implemented an automated swallow detection and a first classification system to help medical professionals gain faster and easier insight in circadian (dys)motility of the esophagus. This significantly reduces the time and manpower required for longterm HRM evaluation and paves the way for a broad clinical use in the future in patients with temporary symptoms of esophageal motility disorders but though high levels of distress.;"[Jell, Alissa; Hueser, Norbert; Steger, Jana; Ostler, Daniel; Feussner, Hubertus] Tech Univ Munich, Med Fac, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Dept Surg, Munich, Germany; [Kuttler, Christina] Tech Univ Munich, Math Fac, Math Modelling, Munich, Germany";Steger, J (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Med Fac, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Dept Surg, Munich, Germany.;"jana.steger@tum.de; daniel.ostler@tum.de; hubertus.feussner@tum.de";Ostler, Daniel/ABE-2661-2020;Ostler, Daniel/0000-0003-2949-7279;;;;4;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-5584-5;;;;2019;;;;;;;995;998;;10.1109/CSCI49370.2019.00189;;;4;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP9OC;WOS:000569996300182;;;;;2020-12-16;

One of the problems of this area is the prediction of the protein functions, which is not so common because the analysis is very laborious and complex to treat, especially when there are classes with hierarchy, that is, their classes orgainized in super classes that inherit Protein functions of subclasses, forming structures of trees or directed acyclic graphs. The method presented here is based on the hierarchical classification of the protein function using machine learning algorithms, thus performing the prediction of protein functions. The novelty of this work lies in the study of feature selection approaches applied to different local-model hierarchical classification approaches. The results were obtained by conducting the experiments using the hierarchical mean and standard deviation, calculated through the correct rates that the hierarchical classification algorithms obtained. From the results found, comparisons were made between the hierarchical classification methods with and without the selection of attributes, thus proving that in the prediction scenario of the protein function, which have their classes in the hierarchical format, become much more favorable with the local hierarchical ranking approach per layer and not using attribute selection.;"[Pereira, Leonardo Henrique; Silla Junior, Carlos Nascimento; Nievola, Julio Cesar] Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, PPGIa, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil";Pereira, LH (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Parana, PPGIa, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.;"leonardo.efeso@gmail.com; silla@ppgia.pucpr.br; nievola@ppgia.pucpr.br";;Silla, Carlos/0000-0002-1603-9378;;;;14;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-5584-5;;;;2019;;;;;;;1476;1481;;10.1109/CSCI49370.2019.00275;;;6;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP9OC;WOS:000569996300268;;;;;2020-12-16;

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) system of a driverless car must be able to arbitrate between different driving strategies in order to properly plan the car's path, based on an understandable traffic scene model. In this paper, an AI behavior arbitration algorithm for Autonomous Driving (AD) is proposed. The method, coined AIBA (AI Behavior Arbitration), has been developed in two stages: (i) human driving scene description and understanding and (ii) formal modelling. The description of the scene is achieved by mimicking a human cognition model, while the modelling part is based on a formal representation which approximates the human driver understanding process. The advantage of the formal representation is that the functional safety of the system can be analytically inferred.

Consequently, the prediction of traffic flows is a key component to an optimal traffic management. As a solution to this issue, the present paper aims at applying the artificial intelligence of neural networks, which offers an interesting approach to modelling in complex, and nonlinear situations. Our resolution method is based on the design of a neural network to predict daily traffic flow. Then, the forecasted traffic flow is compared with a real dataset recorded on a road section and provided by a recognized infrastructure manager in Morocco. Indeed, neural networks have the ability to learn from the past and predict the future. In this study, various neural networks structures are exanimated and simulation results show that the best forecasts are obtained with the use of Multi-Layer Perceptron architecture that has a good generalization capacity with a total Mean Square Error of 0.00927 in the train set and 0.01321 in the test set.

The IR4.0 will reduce the gap between digital and physical world. Keeping ultramodern developments in view, an amalgamation of physical and digital systems will prove to be revolutionary. To elevate from the current state universities are required to prepare curriculum, academicians and students alike. Thus academia should weigh their capabilities putting effort to equip our generations with latest knowledge and skills to face future realism. Universities are required to enhance their approach and methods of education. Latest technologies such as Big Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, and Internet of Things, Cloud Computing and other advancements need to be focused in order for students to learn its application. This paper is based on qualitative research along with a deductive approach focused towards redesigning curriculum and teaching practices in line with IR4.0 practices. The research is focused upon various emerging challenges related to fundamental elements and objectives in academia.

Traditional power grid can be transformed into a smart grid by augmenting it with information and communication technologies, and machine intelligence. Machine learning and artificial intelligence can enable smart grid to make intelligent decisions and respond to sudden changes in customer demands, power outages, sudden drops and rises in renewable energy output or any other catastrophic events. Machine learning can also help capture customer consumption patterns, forecast energy demand and power generation of intermittent sources, and predict equipment failures. Reinforced learning can aid in making energy dispatch decisions and activate demand management signals in order to maintain balance of power supply and demand. The usage of wireless technologies in smart grid renders it vulnerable to cyber security threats. With the increase in data volume, it is now possible to employ machine learning for the detection and prevention of anomalous behaviour, intrusion, cyber-attacks, and malicious activities as well as data authentication. This paper reviews the application of different machine learning approaches that aims at enhancing the stability, reliability, security, efficiency and responsiveness of smart grid.

But two-dimensional display, without stereoscopic visual effect, doctors are not easy to observe.

To bridge this gap, deterrence by engagement and surprise was proposed as a cohesive addition to the existing deterrence theories such as deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. In order to fully support this new type of deterrence initiated from within the cyber domain, artificial intelligence (Al) can play a significant role. This paper takes a close look at the potentials as well as the benefits that Al may bring to the deterrence space. It examines the use of these powerful capabilities in achieving strategic advantages via unique operations. It reveals that Al-based deterrence is a real force multiplier.

In brick-and-mortar retailing marketing actions that are conducted for large-scale grid based on an arbitrarily set distribution area - not tailored to single stores. This is mainly due to the lack of data and missing processes for automatization of marketing management. Even though the collection of data is easy to establish, the resulting data quality and condition is a problem for many clustering algorithms. Even methods of Machine Learning that are considered to be more robust to noise have issues with the unpredictable nature of such data collection, as they rely on a predefined structure. This paper presents a method for collecting a large amount of relevant location information for a major German brick-and-mortar retailer from online data sources and mapping them to a grid model of Germany at the level of 1 km(2).

It is the clients who fail to repay their debt that we are interested in predicting, which makes it a much more difficult task, since they form only a small minority of the total client count. From an input-output perspective, the problem can be stated as: given a set of client properties, such as age, marital status, loan duration, one must yield a 0-1 response variable, with 0 meaning good and 1, bad clients. Many techniques with high accuracy exist, such as artificial neural networks, but they behave as black box units. We add to this whole context the constraint that the output must be a concrete, tractable mathematical formula, which provides significant added value for a financial analyst. To this end, we present a means for evolving mathematical formulas using genetic programming coupled with Language Integrated Query expression trees, a feature present in the C# programming language.;"[Marinescu, Alexandru-Ion; Andreica, Anca] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Cluj Napoca, Romania";Marinescu, AI (corresponding author), Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, Cluj Napoca, Romania.;amarinescu@cs.ubbcluj.ro;;;Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS/CCCDI - UEFISCDI within PNCDI III [PN-III-P2-2.1-BG-2016-0447];This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS/CCCDI - UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P2-2.1-BG-2016-0447, within PNCDI III.;;30;0;0;0;0;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA;2470-8801;;978-1-7281-0625-0;INT SYMP SYMB NUMERI;;;2019;;;;;;;409;416;;10.1109/SYNASC.2018.00069;;;8;"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";"Computer Science; Engineering";BQ1FX;WOS:000575409300058;;;;;2020-12-16;

This fact has forced us to emotionally annotate the songs available in the system, to monitor runners' emotional state and to interpret these data in the recommendation algorithms. A new next-song recommendation system and a mobile application able to play the recommended music from the Spotify streaming service have been developed.

Towards answering queries in large scale problems, state-of-the-art methods employ Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) search, a search that returns the nearest neighbor with high probability, as well as techniques that compress the dataset. Product-Quantization (PQ) based ANN search methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in several problems, including classification, regression and information retrieval. The dataset is encoded into a Cartesian product of multiple low-dimensional codebooks, enabling faster search and higher compression. Being intrinsically parallel, PQ-based ANN search approaches are amendable for hardware acceleration. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical PQ (HPQ) based ANN search method as well as an FPGA-tailored architecture for its implementation that outperforms current state of the art systems. HPQ gradually refines the search space, reducing the number of data compares and enabling a pipelined search. The mapping of the architecture on a Stratix 10 FPGA device demonstrates over x 250 speedups over current state-of-the-art systems, opening the space for addressing larger datasets and/or improving the query times of current systems.;"[Abdelhadi, Ameer M.

Expending NR sources to service EVs is neither sustainable nor desirable when long term effects are considered. Since EVs are still in their initial stages of mass adoption in the US, an updated and scalable approach to servicing the growing EV energy need is required. One such approach in which existing transport infrastructure (gas stations, roads, trucks etc) are multi-purposed with scalable, feasible modifications is presented in this paper.

In this paper, we leverage eHealth and Quantified Self technologies, novel health data visualizations, and artificial intelligence methods to develop a digital-based lifetime health platform (PRISM) to empower individuals to self-assess, self-monitor, and self-manage their risks for multiple chronic diseases and associated morbidities.;"[Daowd, Ali; Faizan, Syed; Abusharekh, Ashraf; Shehzad, Aaqib; Abidi, Syed Sibte Raza] Dalhousie Univ, Fac Comp Sci, NICHE Res Grp, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Abidi, Samina] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Community Hlth & Epidemiol, Halifax, NS, Canada";"Daowd, A; Abidi, SSR (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Fac Comp Sci, Halifax, NS, Canada.";"ali.daowd@dal.ca; ssrabidi@dal.ca";;;;;;11;0;0;0;0;IOS PRESS;AMSTERDAM;NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0926-9630;1879-8365;"978-1-64368-003-3; 978-1-64368-002-6";STUD HEALTH TECHNOL;;;2019;264;;;;;;935;939;;10.3233/SHTI190361;;;5;"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics";"Computer Science; Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics";BP9MI;WOS:000569653400187;31438061;;;;2020-12-16;

This paper addresses this educational gap by applying an artificial intelligence method, based on an extended model of argument, to design and implement a dialogue system that allows users get the educational material they need, when they need it. In the developed system, the studied model of argument was leveraged as part of the system's dialogue manager.

In this work, it is proposed the use of computational intelligence techniques in the management of a hybrid energy storage system based on battery and supercapacitor, both embedded in an electric vehicle. For this purpose, a methodology for prediction and separation of the fractions of power demand, using an artificial neural network (ANN) based on the Non Linear Autoregressive Model with Exogenous Inputs (NARX), is presented. A mixed driving cycle (MDC), composed by the combination of characteristics of different standard driving cycles, is used for NARX ANN training. This proposed MDC ANN training allows a better performance of power demand prediction, when compared to a single driving cycle ANN training approach, since it imposes a more diversified speed profile. From the simulations carried out and the adjustments of the network parameters, a very small error was found in relation to the predicted signals. Based on the obtained results, it is possible to conclude that the proposed method is effective and promising for the calculation of power demand in electric vehicles.;"[Lago, Lucas F.

In particular, Federated Learning (FL) is a key enabler to realize decentralized AI model update without user's privacy disclosure. However, since the behaviour of workers, who are assigned a training task, cannot be monitored, the state-of-the-art methods require a special hardware and/or cryptography to force the workers behave honestly, which hinders the realization. Furthermore, although blockchain-enabled FL has been proposed to give workers reward, any rigorous reward policy design has not been discussed. In this paper, to tackle these issues, we present a novel method using mechanism design, which is an economic approach to realize desired objectives under the situation that participants act rationally. The key idea is to introduce repeated competition for FL so that any rational worker follows the protocol and maximize their profits. With mechanism design, we propose a generic full-fledged protocol design for FL on a public blockchain. We also theoretically clarify incentive compatibility based on contest theory which is an auction-based game theory in economics.;"[Toyoda, Kentaroh; Mang, Allan N.] ASTAR, Singapore Inst Mfg Technol, Singapore, Singapore";Toyoda, K (corresponding author), ASTAR, Singapore Inst Mfg Technol, Singapore, Singapore.;kentaroh.toyoda@ieee.org;;;"A*STAR Industrial Internet of Things Research Program, under the RIE2020 IAF-PP Grant [A1788a0023]; Model Factory@SIMTech";This work is supported by the A*STAR Industrial Internet of Things Research Program, under the RIE2020 IAF-PP Grant A1788a0023, and Model Factory@SIMTech.;;20;3;3;3;3;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2639-1589;;978-1-7281-0858-2;IEEE INT CONF BIG DA;;;2019;;;;;;;395;403;;;;;9;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP4WK;WOS:000554828700048;;;;;2020-12-16;

Rising global temperatures are triggering increases in the frequency and severity of extreme climatic events, such as floods, droughts, & heat waves and resulting in unprecedented increase in economic cost and human impact. For example, Global warming cost the U.S. government more than $350 billion between 2007 and 2017 and will cost $112 billion per year in the future, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Not only economic impact, global warming, importantly, is increasing the human fatality rates. The environmental and health research clearly suggest the linkage between global warming and increase in heat-related mortality, particularly in low-latitude countries, such as India, where heat waves will become more frequent and populations are especially vulnerable to these extreme temperatures. A clear example is a heat wave, scorching temperatures reached a record 116 degrees Fahrenheit, that struck the Indian city of Ahmedabad in 2010 killing hundreds of its most vulnerable citizens. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the climate change contributes to 150,000 deaths each year. By 2030, that number will double. The dire consequence of global warming and increase temperature mortality rates is unequivocally faced by the most vulnerable population, Senior Citizens, due to lack of proactive insights and timely availability of healthcare services. We strongly urge to include global warming related extreme events and its impacts on patients in Electronic Health Records (EHR) and to be imperatively considered as patient well-being data. Next, Electronic Health Records continuously synthesize relationship between Electronic Health Records (EHR) patient health episodes/encounters due to extreme climate events, albeit globally in a de-identified manner, and application of active machine learning techniques: A priori and naive Bayesian and artificial intelligence (AI) to derive hierarchical cohort of high risk senior citizens', outpatients, clusters and proactively delivering population health insights and delivery of timely health services through alerting governmental and non-governmental (NGO) agencies. The golden standard for success is to counter high temperature related mortality rates and to prevent deaths due to temperature related to global warming. In this research paper, we propose the development of high-risk temperature to high mortality cohort cluster-based Machine Learning (ML) / Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to prevent deaths of senior citizens.

These jobs are often divided into parallel child tasks and executed in distributed clusters with limited computing resources, making parallel task scheduling one of the most important research topics nowadays. Most studies about parallel task scheduling focused on formulating special scenarios and service requirements as optimization problems. However, the complicated and dynamic parallel computing environments are hard to model, predict and control, making those previous methods unscalable and unable to reflect the real scenarios. In this paper, a Multi-task Deep reinforcement learning approach for scalable parallel Task Scheduling (MDTS) is firstly devised. Generally, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a modelfree optimization algorithm for long-term control by leveraging experience, but it suffers the curse of dimensionality for decision when coping with complex parallel computing environments and jobs with diverse properties. We extend the action selection in DRL to a multi-task decision, where the output branches of multitask learning are fine-matched to parallel scheduling tasks. Child tasks of a job are accordingly assigned to distributed nodes without any human knowledge while the resource competition among parallel tasks is leveraged through shared neural network layers. Extensive experiments show that the MDTS significantly reduces the job execution lime compared with least-connection scheduling and particle swarm optimization algorithm by 153% and 39.8% respectively. Moreover, MDTS outperforms the raw DRL algorithm on job execution time, load imbalance value, and total cost by 42.8%, 47.5%, and 59.0%.;"[Zhang, Lingxin; Qi, Qi; Wang, Jingyu; Sun, Haifeng; Liao, Jianxin] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China";Zhang, LX (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.;"zhanglingxin@ebupt.com; qiqi@ebupt.com; wangjingyu@ebupt.com; sunhaifeng_1@ebupt.com; liaojianxin@ebupt.com";;;"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61771068, 61671079, 61471063]; Beijing Municipal Natural Science FoundationBeijing Natural Science Foundation [4182041]";This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61771068, Grant 61671079, and Grant 61471063, and in part by the Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation under Grant 4182041.;;35;1;1;2;2;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2639-1589;;978-1-7281-0858-2;IEEE INT CONF BIG DA;;;2019;;;;;;;2992;3001;;;;;10;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP4WK;WOS:000554828703010;;;;;2020-12-16;

However, the mode, medium and timing of maintenance during equipment life cycle have evolved from reactive maintenance to prescriptive maintenance. Reactive maintenance was the main approach practiced until 1980s. The proactive maintenance was introduced in 1990s to insulate customers from equipment failures by using equipment data and fixing problems remotely. Prescriptive maintenance, which incorporates the Internet of Things, digitization and artificial intelligence, especially machine learning, has gained importance as in intelligent approach to equipment maintenance and has the potential to greatly improve upon proactive maintenance. However, existing prescriptive maintenance solutions are piece-meal and lack complete solutions to keep equipment in working conditions most of the time at optimal cost. We propose a Holistic End to End Prescriptive Maintenance (HeePMF) framework resulting in much reduced unplanned equipment downtime at optimal cost. This framework provides solution by integrating maintenance needs analysis, equipment and operational data, predictive technologies with feedback, personnel scheduling, supply chain improvement, part management, process improvement and knowledge management. The working of framework is demonstrated by providing a case study.;"[Choubey, Suresh; Benton, Ryan; Johnsten, Tom] Univ S Alabama, Sch Comp, Mobile, AL 36688 USA";Choubey, S (corresponding author), Univ S Alabama, Sch Comp, Mobile, AL 36688 USA.;"schoubey@southalabama.edu; rbenton@southalabama.edu; tjohnsten@southalabama.edu";;;;;;19;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2639-1589;;978-1-7281-0858-2;IEEE INT CONF BIG DA;;;2019;;;;;;;4366;4374;;;;;9;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP4WK;WOS:000554828704070;;;;;2020-12-16;

In recent years, application-based researchers in machine learning and deep learning have started developing solutions for many practical problems. Handwriting recognition is one such area of interest. Bangla, being the seventh most spoken language in the world, is not an exception. However, unlike English, there have not been concerted formal attempts in building a benchmark in comparing the different approaches reported in the literature, mainly because of the lack of openly and freely available datasets and diversity of the approaches without formal comparative studies. In this research paper, we seek to rectify this gap. We have focused on benchmarking five robust algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multi-layer Perceptron (MEP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), on all publicly available Bangla handwriting digits datasets, including Ekush, NumtaDB, CMARTdb, and BDRW. NumtaDB itself is a collection of five handwriting datasets. We have worked on fine-tuning these algorithms by finding the best possible hyper-parameters of these algorithms. It is our hope that Sankhya will work as a beginning point of an open and verifiable benchmarking process that we plan to repeat every two years for now on and set a standard for testing and validating newer and novel algorithms that will be reported in this area in the future. In addition, we have extensively compared our research with other states of the art research and our versions of these algorithms are now outperforming every reported result on these datasets. All the datasets we used are open-sourced. In addition, we are making the .csv version of these datasets available in public GitHub. Of all the models we tested, the Sankhya CNN model performed the best for all these datasets, which we fine-tuned specifically for Bangla character recognition. We are making this CNN model available in public GitHub.;"[Islam, Aminul; Rabby, A. K. M.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) owe their success to the availability of massive labeled data. However, in many real-world problems, even when a large dataset is available, deep learning methods have shown less success, due to causes such as lack of large labeled dataset, presence of noise in data, or missing data. In the present work, we intend to examine the application of deep learning methods on radar data gathered from polar regions. Our goal is to track internal ice layers in radar imagery. In such data, the presence of noise is one of the main obstacles in utilizing popular deep learning methods such as transfer learning Our experiments show that if the neural network is trained to detect contours of objects in electro-optical imagery, it can only track a low percentage of contours in radar data. Fine-tuning and further training do not provide any better results. However, we will show that selecting the right model and training the model on the radar imagery from the base, is going to yield far better results.

However, it is difficult for a single healthcare institution to collect sufficient medical records to support a sophisticated automatic disease recognition model, especially for some rare diseases, which urges the collaboration among different medical institutions and hospitals. The current mainstream solutions, like centralized distributed machine learning, heavily rely on a central server, which may be vulnerable to attackers or even malicious itself. Meanwhile, data privacy concerns make hospitals reluctant to share their patients' records with others. To solve these issues, in this work, we utilize the blockchain to build a decentralized privacy-preserving cross-institution disease classification framework, called Health-Chain. Specifically, we combined differential privacy and pseudo-identity mechanism to protect data privacy in distributed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. Meanwhile, we equip gradient delay compensation to address the asynchronous issues in the decentralized blockchain-based learning system.

With the revolutionary growth of the amount of information, big data is the key to boost ML prediction, therefore, we introduce a general Kelly framework, including the strength of Kelly, ML, and big data. In addition, we propose the Kelly stationary index (KSI) to quantify the stationarity of the stock's outcomes distribution, which will affect the trading period and forecasting frequency. We calculate the KSI of each constituent stock of Taiwan's 50, and apply the Kelly criterion strategy to verify the effectiveness of KSI. The experimental results show that there is a moderate downhill relationship between the strategy performance and KSI with the -0.591 of correlation coefficient. It also indicates that the closer the estimated distribution is to the actual distribution, the higher the expected profit. In the future, we will use KSI for money management, strategy development, and apply KSI into the general Kelly framework.;"[Syu, Jia-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wu, Mu-En] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Informat & Finance Management, Taipei, Taiwan; [Ho, Jan-Ming] Acad Sinica, Inst Informat Sci, Taipei, Taiwan";Syu, JH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.;"r08922011@ntu.edu.tw; mnwu@ntut.edu.tw; hoho@iis.sinica.edu.tw";;;;;;8;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2639-1589;;978-1-7281-0858-2;IEEE INT CONF BIG DA;;;2019;;;;;;;5569;5572;;;;;4;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP4WK;WOS:000554828705090;;;;;2020-12-16;

However, the vast portion of data used to train AI systems is sensitive information. Hence, any vulnerability has a potentially disastrous impact on privacy aspects and security issues. Nevertheless, the increased demands for high-quality AI from governments and companies require the utilization of big data in the systems. Several studies have highlighted the threats of big data on different platforms and the countermeasures to reduce the risks caused by attacks. In this paper, we provide an overview of the existing threats which violate privacy aspects and security issues inflicted by big data as a primary driving force within the AI/ML workflow. We define an adversarial model to investigate the attacks. Additionally, we analyze and summarize the defense strategies and countermeasures of these attacks. Furthermore, due to the impact of AI systems in the market and the vast majority of business sectors, we also investigate Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) that are actively involved in providing guidelines to protect the privacy and ensure the security of big data and AI systems. Our far-reaching goal is to bridge the research and standardization frame to increase the consistency and efficiency of AI systems developments guaranteeing customer satisfaction while transferring a high degree of trustworthiness.;"[Dilmaghani, Saharnaz; Brust, Matthias R.; Danoy, Gregoire; Bouvry, Pas Cal] Univ Luxembourg, Interdisciplinary Ctr Secur Reliabil & Trust SnT, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Danoy, Gregoire; Bouvry, Pas Cal] Univ Luxembourg, Fac Sci Technol & Commun FSTC, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Cassagnes, Natalia; Pecero, Johnatan] Agence Normalisat & Econ Connaissance ANEC GIE, Luxembourg, Luxembourg";Dilmaghani, S (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Interdisciplinary Ctr Secur Reliabil & Trust SnT, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.;;"Brust, Matthias R./D-3243-2019; Danoy, Gregoire/E-3588-2018";"Brust, Matthias R./0000-0001-8155-0626; Danoy, Gregoire/0000-0001-9419-4210";joint research programme University of Luxembourg/SnT-ILNAS on Digital Trust for Smart-ICT;This work is partially funded by the joint research programme University of Luxembourg/SnT-ILNAS on Digital Trust for Smart-ICT.;;74;2;2;1;1;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2639-1589;;978-1-7281-0858-2;IEEE INT CONF BIG DA;;;2019;;;;;;;5737;5743;;;;;7;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP4WK;WOS:000554828705113;;;;;2020-12-16;

With no known cures, there is a pressing need to find behavioral tasks and biomarkers that can accurately assess and/or predict disease progression in asymptotic patients, as treatment is likely to be most effective at an early stage of AD. On the other hand, artificial intelligence systems are powerful and critical tools to support early detection and diagnosis, treatment, as well as outcome prediction and prognosis evaluation in healthcare. In this study, standard neuropsychological tests and a simple 5.5-minute cognitive task were administered to patients with mild AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (AD group, n=28) and cognitively normal older adults (Control group, n=50). Patients with mild AD or MCI were collapsed together as the AD group. Four different machine learning algorithms were applied to classify patients from healthy controls using the data collected from neuropsychological tests, or the cognitive task, or both. The results of the study revealed that machine learning technique has the potential to assist AD diagnosis using the neuropsychological data, and when combining the neuropsychological and cognitive data, the classification accuracy can be further improved.Y;"[Almubark, Ibrahim; Chang, Lin-Ching; Nguyen, Thanh] Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Washington, DC 20064 USA; [Turner, Raymond Scott] Georgetown Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [Jiang, Xiong] Georgetown Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurosci, Washington, DC 20007 USA";Almubark, I (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Amer, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Washington, DC 20064 USA.;"47almubark@cua.edu; changl@cua.edu; 32nguyen@cua.edu; rst36@georgetown.edu; xj9@georgetown.edu";;;"Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation; BrightFocus FoundationBrightFocus Foundation";Funding provided by the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation and the BrightFocus Foundation.;;7;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2639-1589;;978-1-7281-0858-2;IEEE INT CONF BIG DA;;;2019;;;;;;;5971;5973;;;;;3;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP4WK;WOS:000554828706013;;;;;2020-12-16;

For educators, teaching such a vast and dynamic field is both a necessity and a challenge. IoT-relevant topics such as programming, hardware, networking and artificial intelligence are already covered in core computing curricula. Does this mean that fresh graduates are well prepared to tackle complex IoT problems? Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. The problem is that IoT devices are complex systems, where software, hardware, and humans interact with each other. From this interaction, unique behavior and hazardous situations can emerge that might easily stay undetected, unless systems are analyzed as a whole. This paper presents two differently flavored courses that teach IoT using a holistic, system-centric approach. The first is a broad introduction to Pervasive Computing, focused on the intelligence of Things. The second is an advanced course that zooms on the process of testing a software-intensive system. The key characteristics of our approach are : (1) teaching only the bare essentials (topics needed for end-to-end engineering of a smart system), (2) a strong, hands-on project component, using microcontroller-based miniature systems, inspired by real-life, and (3) a rich partnership with industry and academic idea incubators. Positive student evaluations gathered during the last five years demonstrate that such an approach brings engagement, self-confidence and realism in IoT classrooms. We believe that this success can be replicated in other courses, by shifting the focus on different IoT-relevant aspects.;[Silvis-Cividjian, Natalia] Vrije Univ VU, Comp Sci Dept, Amsterdam, Netherlands;Silvis-Cividjian, N (corresponding author), Vrije Univ VU, Comp Sci Dept, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;n.silvis-cividjian@vu.nl;;;;;;31;0;0;0;0;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA;;;978-1-7281-1000-4;;;;2019;;;;;;;50;61;;10.1109/ICSE-SEET.2019.00014;;;12;"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Education, Scientific Disciplines";"Computer Science; Education & Educational Research";BP9RP;WOS:000570746000006;;;;;2020-12-16;

Artificial intelligence is increasingly being adopted to assist radiological interpretation of PET images. In this work, we for the first time set instance object detection in PET imaging in a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. Q learning, a model free RL learning algorithm, is used to learn a policy which tells an agent what actions to take to maximize a reward in an environment in order to achieve a specific task. In this work Q learning with a novel reward function defined by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is used to detect instances of an object in PET images. The RL agent is tested using a phantom study and accurately identifies the location of all five spheres; producing a mean error of 1:5 voxels. Testing is also performed on two 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose investigations imaged for oesophageal cancer. The location of the cancer lesion determined by the RL agent on a sagittal cross section is in excellent correspondence to the location defined by an expert radiologist, with a mean error of 2 voxels.

As a representative deep learning algorithm, convolutional neural network has been widely used due to its excellent performance in image processing. It is widely used in various fields and has made great achievements. Image recognition is the most important problem in the development of computer vision. Since computers can recognize objects, computer vision can be used in many fields. How to identify vehicles and people in driverless driving and public safety is very important and meaningful. By identifying cars or pedestrians in front of you on autopilot, computers can predict danger by taking precautions in advance. Therefore, this experiment USES convolutional neural network to classify cat and dog images. Neural network generally needs a large number of data sets, but the number of our data sets often cannot meet our needs, so it is very meaningful to build a better model in the case of small data. A nine-layer artificial convolutional neural network is established and the error iteration is tested by the optimal value and test set of batch gradient descent method and local demand model. Experimental results show that after 30 iterations, the accuracy of training set is close to 100%, while the accuracy of test set is only about 70%. Therefore, this paper adopts the following three methods to optimize the model step by step. First, we use the migration learning method to call the VGG16 model in the keras library to conduct training prediction for this experiment. Data enhancement was then performed to further optimize the model. Finally, the model is optimized and improved by fine-tuning. The experimental results show that the experimental results are good and can meet our experimental requirements.;"[Chen, Lan; Jiang, Zhiyuan; Wang, Zhiyong] Shanghai Inst Technol, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China";Chen, L (corresponding author), Shanghai Inst Technol, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;;;;;;;4;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;1559-9450;;978-1-7281-5304-9;PR ELECTROMAGN RES S;;;2019;;;;;;;816;820;;;;;5;"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Physics, Applied";"Engineering; Physics";BP6PH;WOS:000560305100133;;;;;2020-12-16;

Analyzing CT images is an effective method to evaluate the type of hepatic lesions. The original evaluation method is that medical personnel assessment by images, but abdominal CT images are complex, and the accuracy of the discrimination depends strongly on the subjective factors, knowledge level and experience of medical personnel. With the development of artificial intelligence technology, the hepatic lesions recognition technology based on deep visual feature learning can achieve a higher accuracy. While reducing the workload for doctors, this technology can assist doctors to diagnose the disease, so as to obtain more objective and accurate diagnosis results. The database established in this paper mainly includes three kinds of CT images: primary liver cancer, cirrhosis and normal liver. After the database pretreatment with image de-noise algorithms based on median filter and picture enhancement algorithms based on histogram equalization, the convolution neural network CaffeNet was taken as the main framework, and a large number of labeled liver CT images were used to train the network in the experimental process. Meanwhile, the network parameters were continuously updated according to the cost function. Traditional hepatic lesion recognition technology only depends on the surface features from the image, such as gray scale, statistical structure and texture. Deep learning, a tool with high precision and robustness, could be used to mine the hidden features in the huge database. Through testing the trained deep learning model, the average recognition accuracy of 96.67% and the average single sample recognition time of 1.28 seconds could be achieved perfectly. Therefore, there is no doubt that hepatic lesion recognition technology based on deep visual feature learning will greatly liberate doctors' physical strength and promote the development of pathology in the near future.;"[Zhai, Shengqing; Yang, Yusi; Lin, Lan] Tongji Univ, Dept Elect Sci & Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ou, Wenbo] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Dept Automat, Changsha, Peoples R China";Zhai, SQ (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Dept Elect Sci & Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;;;;National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61373106];This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant No. 61373106.

In addition, sensors are included in order to monitor the health status of specific components, which enable to detect certain known, frequently occurring faults or undesired states of the system. While the identification of a failure by using the data of a sensor dedicated explicitly to its detection is a rather straightforward machine learning application, the detection of failures which only have an indirect effect on the data produced by a couple of other sensors is much more challenging. Therefore, a combination of different methods from Artificial Intelligence, in particular, machine learning and knowledge-based (semantic) approaches is required to identify relevant patterns (or failure modes). However, there are currently no appropriate research environments and data sets available that can be used for this kind of research. In this paper, we propose an approach for the generation of predictive maintenance data by using a physical Fischertechnik model factory equipped with several sensors.

Historically, joining element design was a paper-based process with incomplete variety documentation and is digitalized only by replacing paper for 3D space. Currently, joining element design remains an ambiguous manual task with limited automation, resulting in long iterative, error prone development trajectories and costly reworks. Thus, processes in practice conflict with required capabilities. Artificial intelligence helps to solve such conflicts by taking over repetitive tasks, preventing human errors, optimizing designs and enabling designers to focus on their core competencies. This paper proposes a novel artificial intelligence method toolbox as a foundation to automate joining element design in manufacturing industries.

That is essentially because the main way to exchange and process information is by written text, images or videos. Since the basic purpose of innovation is to improve people's lifestyle, in this paper we propose a system that can make technology accessible to a broader group. Our prototype is presented as a mobile application based on vocal interaction, which can help people facing visual disorders consult their personal agenda, create an event, invite other friends to attend it, check the weather in certain areas and many other day-to-day tasks. Regarding the implementation, the project consists of a mobile application that interacts with a cloud based system, which makes it reliable and low in latency due to the resource availability in multiple global regions, provided by the newly emerging platform used in building the infrastructure. The novelty of the system lays in the highly flexible serverless architecture [1] that is open to extension and closed to modification through the set of autonomous cloud processing methods that sustain the base of the functionality. This distributed processing approach guarantees that the user always receives a response from his personal assistant, either by using artificial intelligence context generated phrases, by real-time cloud function processing or by fallback to the training answers.

Path planning is a common transportation problem, which can be extremely difficult when an exact solution is sought. The quality of heuristic approaches to this problem is therefore important, as they are now implemented as planning modules into almost all the ITSs on the market. The goal of this paper is to analyze several distributed reinforcement learning techniques involving the collective experience of artificial ants when approaching a transportation problem. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a well-known NP-hard transportation problem, was chosen for computational experiments. In order to assess the behavior of the investigated solving methods, two medium-size TSP instances, covering large areas,are proposed. The results are compared with those provided by a state-of-the-art technique, namely the highly effective Lin-Kernighan(LK) heuristic procedure for generating optimum and near-optimum solutions for the TSP. This paper connects the academic Operational Research with societal needs in Transportation and Logistics. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Nowadays, an AI problem is usually modelled as a transitional system, by following four steps: identify a representation for a problem state, describe the initial and final states in that representation, describe valid transitions together with a search strategy that looks for a path between an initial and a final state using the available transitions. This paper proposes a new language for describing AI models with the goal to generate executable code. The proposed language is capable of representing all common types of problems, and models implemented can be adapted easily to any search strategy with specific requirements (such as score functions). The language is fully described in this paper together with several non-trivial examples, while the code generation feature is work-in-progress. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We expect a future where transactions will be based on clouds and virtual machines, gathered from sensors and IoT devices and processed by different artificial intelligence algorithms or agents. The speed and backlash change in the world has driven researchers to work on privacy and security for entities' information and transactions. Different concepts arise and still in their early stage as digital identity, self sovereign identity, global unique identifier and identity of things (IDoT). Therefore, motivated by the recent explosion of interest around Blockchains, we examine whether they make a good fit for the Identity Internet of Things (IDoT) sector. Blockchain a major distributed peer-to-peer network where non-trusting members can interact together without a need for a trusted third party, it actually make available many advantages to providers and consumers and solve data protection features lifelong a transaction existing. As being immutable, transparent and trustful platform the Blockchain allows managing identities and privacy of its nodes information. Our contribution is a new architecture eventually using a public Blockchain and creating a smart identity wallet. It contains standard node data and will also integrate proactive data behavior and the reactive one. The main target is to protect users from Sybil attack at early stage.

Nevertheless, one of the additional aspects of data clustering is proper interpretation of the clustering results. In this paper we aim to investigate possibilities of using both data clustering and visualization methods to analyze a sample diabetes dataset. In the first part, we focus on how to cluster a highly-dimensional sample dataset and then, we concentrate on how to properly visually present the clustering results in the most meaningful way to uncover potentially interesting behavioral patterns or features of diabetes patients. In this work we examine two clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, k-Means) along with several different distance measures. We also present sample visualizations of clustering results generated by an application which we have developed and discuss if the proposed way of clustering results visualization can be helpful in understanding the analyzed dataset and lead a viewer to drawing valuable conclusions about it.

The electromagnetic environment of the substation is complex, and whether the inspection robot can work normally in a complex electromagnetic environment is a problem worthy of attention. Therefore, this paper establishes an inspection robot model to explore the electric field distribution of the inspection robot during substation operation. The Charge Simulation Method is suitable for the calculation of open domain, and the Finite Element Method is suitable fir the calculation of complex boundary problems. Combining the advantages of the two, this paper uses the mixed calculation of Finite Element Method and Charge Simulation method to analyze the electric field distribution around the inspection robot when it's working.

It is to classify the fault alarms and diagnose smart solutions at level zero to resolve the faults without service expert's intervention. Big data analysis of the large historical data pool results in the intelligent algorithms that can power the diagnostic models. For maximum efficiency, wind turbines tend to be located in remote locations such as on offshore platforms. However, this remoteness leads to high maintenance costs and high downtime when faults occur. These factors highlight the importance of early fault detection and fast resolution in great extent.

Since WCS's spectrum is naturally known to be unstable, time dependent and currently not only scarce in capacity but heavily congested and the impacts of its various services and its rapidly evolving applications are constantly making the system to be extremely complex. However as proposed by Mitola in 1999, Cognitive Radio (CR) has been developed with such intelligence capabilities and through it, the present-day WCS's spectrum complexity can be effectively managed, at the same time increases its scarce and the highly varying spectrum utilization particularly in complicated WCS's environments. To address this, CR system through its intelligence mechanism, which is also known as the Cognitive Engine (CE) enforces such adaptive intelligence functionalities to dynamically adjust its input parameters, observing its surrounding environment and ultimately makes its decision to meet the WCS's desired objective.

This phenomenon where a single word could have multiple meaning and the correct meaning is deduced from the context it is being used as is known as Word Sense Disambiguation.

The seismic design forces are inversely proportional to the fundamental time period. Therefore, underestimation of fundamental time period will lead to overestimation of design forces and will lead to uneconomical design. Majority of the buildings contain irregularity in some form or other due to functional and aesthetic considerations. These buildings have experienced large failures during the previous earthquakes. This is due to ignorance of the irregularity aspect in formulating the seismic design philosophies. This research work aims to address these short-comings and propose new design philosophies. To achieve this purpose, 256 building models with different degrees of mass irregularity have been modeled and analyzed using E-Tabs soft-ware. The analysis results are tabulated to create a seismic response databank. Regression analysis has been conducted on the response databank to propose new equations to estimate the fundamental time period.

These systems react to voice commands, whether it is for answering a question, providing music or turning on the lights. To be efficient, these systems must be able to extract the intent of the user from the voice command. Intent recognition from voice is typically performed through automatic speech recognition (ASR) and intent classification from the transcriptions in a pipeline. However, the errors accumulated at the ASR stage might severely impact the intent classifier. In this paper, we propose an End-to-End (E2E) model to perform intent classification directly from the raw speech input. The E2E approach is thus optimized for this specific task and avoids error propagation. Furthermore, prosodic aspects of the speech signal can be exploited by the E2E model for intent classification (e.g., question vs imperative voice). Experiments on a corpus of voice commands acquired in a real smart home reveal that the state-of-the art pipeline baseline is still superior to the E2E approach. However, using artificial data generation techniques we show that significant improvement to the E2E model can be brought to reach competitive performances.

One promising solution is to improve the feedback from the device to the user. Towards this end, we present a simple machine learning interface to supplement the control of a robotic limb with feedback to the user about what the limb will be experiencing in the near future. A real-time prediction learner was implemented to predict impact related electrical load experienced by a robot limb; the learning system's predictions were then communicated to the device's user to aid in their interactions with a workspace. We tested this system with five able-bodied subjects. Each subject manipulated the robot arm while receiving different forms of vibrotactile feedback regarding the arm's contact with its workspace. Our trials showed that using machine-learned predictions as a basis for feedback led to a statistically significant improvement in task performance when compared to purely reactive feedback from the device. Our study therefore contributes initial evidence that prediction learning and machine intelligence can benefit not just control, but also feedback from an artificial limb. We expect that a greater level of acceptance and ownership can be achieved if the prosthesis itself takes an active role in transmitting learned knowledge about its state and its situation of use.";"[Parker, Adam S.

However, with advancements in artificial intelligence, fingerprint-based security methods are vulnerable to attack. Such a breach has the potential to compromise confidential, private and valuable information. In this paper, we attack a state-of-the-art fingerprint recognition system based on transfer learning. Our approach uses attribution analysis to identify the fingerprint region crucial to correct classification, and then perturbs the fingerprint using error masks derived from a neural network to generate an adversarial fingerprint. Image quality assessment metrics applied to calculate the difference between the original and perturbed fingerprints include average difference, maximum difference, normalized absolute error, and peak signal to noise ratio. On the ATVS fingerprint dataset, the differences between these values in the original and corresponding perturbed fingerprint images are negligible. Further, the VeriFinger SDK is used to detect the minutiae and perform matching between the original and perturbed fingerprints. The matching score is above 250, which reinforces the fact that there is virtually no loss between the original and perturbed fingerprints.;"[Fernandes, Steven; Raj, Sunny; Jha, Sumit Kumar] Univ Cent Florida, Comp Sci Dept, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Ortiz, Eddy; Vintila, Iustina] Royal Bank Canada, Solut Accelerat & Innovat Dept, Toronto, ON, Canada";Fernandes, S (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Comp Sci Dept, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.;"steven@cs.ucf.edu; sraj@cs.ucf.edu; eddy.ortiz@rbc.com; iustina.vintila@rbc.ccm; jha@cs.ucf.edu";;;"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1822976, 1422257]; Florida Cybersecurity Center; Royal Bank of Canada; Air Force Young Investigator Award";We acknowledge support from NSF Awards #1822976 and #1422257, an award from the Florida Cybersecurity Center, Royal Bank of Canada, and the Air Force Young Investigator Award to Sumit Jha.;;30;3;3;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2376-4201;;978-1-7281-3640-0;INT CONF BIOMETR;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;8;"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Mathematical & Computational Biology";"Engineering; Mathematical & Computational Biology";BP2EI;WOS:000542138900018;;;;;2020-12-16;

Recent success in artificial intelligence research demonstrates the suitability and relevance of neural networks and learning approaches for image classification and off-road robotics. Nonetheless, meaningful decision making processes require semantic knowledge to enable complex scene understanding on a higher abstraction level than pure image data. A promising approach to incooperate semantic knowledge are ontologies. Especially in the off-road domain, scene object correlations heavily influence the navigation outcome and misinterpretations may lead to the loss of the robot, environmental, or even personal damage. In the past, behavior-based control systems have proven to robustly handle such uncertain environments. This paper combines both approaches to achieve a situation-aware navigation in off-road environments. Hereby, the robot's navigation is improved using high-level off-road background knowledge in form of ontologies along with a reactive, and modular behavior network.

As a first original contribution, we improve the CVaR Value Iteration algorithm (Chow et al., 2015) in a way that reduces computational complexity of the original algorithm from polynomial to linear time. Secondly, we propose a sampling version of CVaR Value Iteration we call CVaR Q-learning. We also derive a distributional policy improvement algorithm, and later use it as a heuristic for extracting the optimal policy from the converged CVaR Q-learning algorithm. Finally, to show the scalability of our method, we propose an approximate Q-learning algorithm by reformulating the CVaR Temporal Difference update rule as a loss function which we later use in a deep learning context.

Neural network classifiers are one type of classifier where it is difficult to know how the inputs map to the decision. This paper presents a technique to extract rules from a neural network where the feature space is Boolean, without looking at the inner structure of the network. For such a network with a small feature space, a Boolean function describing it can be directly calculated, whilst for a network with a larger feature space, a sampling method is described to produce rule-based approximations to the behaviour of the network with varying granularity, leading to XAI.

Long short-term memory (LSTM) model in deep learning can effectively describe the long memory of data and is suitable for predicting financial time series. Therefore, this paper uses LSTM model in deep learning to learn and forecast the stock market valuation indicator, price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio). Then the prediction bias is measured by forecast trend accuracy (FTA), average forecast deviation rate (AFDR), and root mean square error (RMSE). Empirical results show that LSTM model has a good predictive effect on P/E ratio sequence, indicating that there is practical research value for applying deep learning network algorithm to the field of stock market forecasting.

In this regard, the paper proposes a novel deep-learning-based architecture for processing surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals to classify and recognize upper-limb hand gestures via incorporation of dilated causal convolutions. The proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve the overall recognition accuracy due to the specific design of the convolutional layers. By using dilated causal convolutions which gradually increases the receptive field of the network, and by applying Conv1D, the proposed architecture eliminates the need for readjustment of the input sequences and inherently takes into account the hidden temporal correlations existing among the available set of sEMG sequences. Contrary to recent hybrid (RNN-CNN) solutions, the proposed architecture neither uses recurrent units nor 2 -dimensional convolutions. The publically-accessible NinaPro DB2 dataset is utilized for training and evaluation of the proposed network. Through an extensive set of experiments, it is observed that the proposed architecture significantly outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts and provides an average 8.71% performance improvement.;"[Rahimian, Elahe; Mohammadi, Arash] Concordia Inst Informat Syst Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Zabihi, Soheil; Asif, Amir] Concordia Univ, Elect & Comp Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Atashzar, S.

However, despite this AI rapid and increasing market expansion, there are numerous related challenges need to be tackled. In this paper, the purpose is to show through another structured approach derived from ARIZ algorithm and some principles coined by TrizStartup movement [1], some of the problems deep learning industries are trying to handle. This paper shows how TRIZ can be applied to fix one of those AI problems. In fact, due to DL neural networks (NN) hidden layers, their outputs are not reliable. If an error occurs, how could human reproduce the issue? Human are not able to identify activated neurons to analyse root causes of this malfunction. Therefore, reliability issue from hidden layers versus rapid AI market skyrocket, data and speed processing, generates innovation problems. In order to resolve this, principle 35-parameter changes with Althshuler Matrix, little people, Su-Field analysis, seventy-six standards solutions, have been used to generate quantum functions. The result described in this paper is a new function called QuantumReLU (QReLU), created with Quantum computer in order to extend classical activation function ReLU. It is then possible to fire neuron with activation function QReLU, and to use quantum states to identify activated neurons within hidden layers. Thus, Triz systematic approach led switching neural networks algorithms from classical to quantum computer, and therefore to build deep learning NN on quantum computer, based on the new QReLU activation function.;[Guehika, Adehi] HEC Montreal, 3000 Chemin Coate St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada;Guehika, A (corresponding author), HEC Montreal, 3000 Chemin Coate St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.;Adehi.guehika@hec.ca;;;;;;12;0;0;0;0;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;1868-4238;1868-422X;"978-3-030-32497-1; 978-3-030-32496-4";IFIP ADV INF COMM TE;;;2019;572;;;;;;371;387;;10.1007/978-3-030-32497-1_30;;;17;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Business & Economics; Telecommunications";BP9YX;WOS:000571099200030;;;;;2020-12-16;

However, this does not entirely eliminate the role of the human workers since some jobs need human reasoning or do not worth employing an expensive robot to do. This made the interaction between a human and a robot a persistent safety issue since there have been so many registered accidents where the robot was the main contributor to them. The international standardization organization (ISO) has set some safety procedures to be followed in areas with human-robot interaction (HRI), which should be adopted by every work environment where this interaction exists. This research explains how to adopt this standard in building a software-hardware integrated system that assures the safety and the well-being of the human workers in an HRI environment, without affecting the workflow or the processing speed of the production in the factory.

Multifunctional or flexible room is one of the important parts of the home. This particular room needs well-designed lighting for comfort. It should give an adequate illuminance for every activity and even pattern of light. This paper presents the factors for developing the smart adaptive lighting system which can provide lighting comfort for the occupants. The simulation is being done in 5 scenarios in the LIMIT BRE 2010 house model using DIALux Software with the dimmable type of LED independent luminaire. The proposed system structure uses a wireless sensor network (WSN) and big data processing as the main components. The design employs an Artificial Intelligence (Al) sub-system which has the capability to predict and adaptively regulate the illumination level based on the occupant needs or routine. The simulation shows that this system is able to give even lighting pattern for luminance values 200, 250, 300, 500, and 750 lux which are needed by the occupants. With the possibility of user-clamed lighting values, this system can be developed to accommodate the needs of special groups of occupants such as the elder or disabled groups.;"[Karyono, Kanisius; Abdullah, Badr M.; Cotgrave, Alison J.; Bras, Ana Armada] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Fac Engn & Technol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Karyono, Kanisius] Univ Multimedia Nusantara, Fac Engn & Informat, Tangerang, Indonesia";"Karyono, K (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Fac Engn & Technol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.; Karyono, K (corresponding author), Univ Multimedia Nusantara, Fac Engn & Informat, Tangerang, Indonesia.";"karyono@umn.ac.id; B.M.Abdullah@ljmu.ac.uk; A.J.Cotgrave@ljmu.ac.uk; A.M.ArmadaBras@ljmu.ac.uk";;karyono, kanisius/0000-0002-6809-5152;;;;36;1;1;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2161-1343;;978-1-7281-3021-7;I C DEV ESYST ENG;;;2019;;;;;;;990;995;;10.1109/DeSE.2019.00184;;;6;Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications;Computer Science;BP9OM;WOS:000570021300171;;Green Accepted;;;2020-12-16;

First, we provide a qualified defence of the value of less data within the context of AI. This is done by carefully reviewing two distinct problems for big data driven AI, namely a) the limited track record of Deep Learning (DL) in key areas such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), b) the regulatory and business significance of being able to learn from few data points. Second, we briefly sketch what we refer to as a case of A.I. with humans and for humans, namely an AI paradigm whereby the systems we build are privacy-oriented and focused on human-machine collaboration, not competition.

Sharing of medical image data, however, is often restricted by laws such as doctor-patient confidentiality. Although there are publicly available medical datasets, their quality and quantity are often low. Moreover, datasets are often imbalanced and only represent a fraction of the images generated in hospitals or clinics and can thus usually only be used as training data for specific problems. The introduction of generative adversarial networks (GANs) provides a mean to generate artificial images by training two convolutional networks. This paper proposes a method which uses GANs trained on medical images in order to generate a large number of artificial images that could be used to train other artificial intelligence algorithms. This work is a first step towards alleviating data privacy concerns and being able to publicly share data that still contains a substantial amount of the information in the original private data. The method has been evaluated on several public datasets and quantitative and qualitative tests showing promising results.;"[Middel, Luise; Erdt, Marius] Fraunhofer Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Palm, Christoph] Regensburg Med Image Comp ReMIC, Regensburg, Germany; [Palm, Christoph] Ostbayer TH Regensburg OTH Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany; [Erdt, Marius] Nanyang Technol Univ NTU, Singapore, Singapore";Middel, L (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.;"luise.middel@gmail.com; marius.erdt@fraunhofer.sg";;Erdt, Marius/0000-0002-1033-5205;;;;11;1;1;0;0;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-32689-0; 978-3-030-32688-3";LECT NOTES COMPUT SC;;;2019;11840;;;;;;125;134;;10.1007/978-3-030-32689-0_13;;;10;"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";"Computer Science; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging";BP9RD;WOS:000570668800013;;;;;2020-12-16;

Moreover, none of the previous studies has used the Net Valence Model (NVM) in investigating AV adoption. Realizing this gap, the aim of this study is to investigate factors influencing the adoption by novice drivers of Level 4 AVs.

E-commerce is adopted as strategy to enhance business competitiveness but success in the online business world usually starts with providing the best customer service. Although organizations are struggling on improving their performance on customer service, some issues of traditional customer service continue to appear such as limited availability, inefficiency and costly. In order to overcome the limitation of traditional customer service, artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly utilized in service nowadays to act as an assistant for human beings. Along with the integration of AI in customer service, human agents and AI can work together to provide perfect services to customers and increase productivity. Hence, this study aims to identify the constructs and characteristics of AI customer service in E-commerce. This paper started with formulating research questions, setting up objectives and proposing an AI customer service model. The proposed model was derived based on the understanding of traditional and AI customer service in e-commerce as well as the related models and papers from prior research. Finally, overall conclusions, limitations and future works will be presented with regard to AI customer service in E-commerce.;"[Ping, Ng Lian] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Comp, Skudai, Malaysia; [Hussin, Ab Razak bin Che; Ali, Nazmona Binti Mat] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Azman Hashim Int Business Sch, Skudai, Malaysia";Ping, NL (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Sch Comp, Skudai, Malaysia.;"ngping94@gmail.com; abrazak@utm.my; nazmona@utm.my";;;"Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE)Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR) [07G33]; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) [07G33]";The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) and the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) for the UTM Transdisciplinary Research Grant (vote number: 07G33) that had supported this research.;;30;0;0;2;2;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2324-8149;;978-1-7281-6726-8;INT CONF RES INNOV;;;2019;;;;;;;;;PID6293773;;;;6;Computer Science, Information Systems;Computer Science;BP9OO;WOS:000570059200017;;;;;2020-12-16;

Properties such as immutability, accessibility and non-repudiation and the existence of smart-contracts make blockchain technology very interesting in robotic contexts that require event registration or integration with Artificial Intelligence. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages blockchain as a ledger to register events and information to be processed by Oracles and uses smart-contracts to control robots by adjusting their velocity, or stopping them, if a person enters the robot working space without permission. We show how blockchain can be used in computer vision problems by interacting with multiple external parties, Oracles, that perform image analysis and how it is possible to use multiple smart-contracts for different tasks. The method proposed is shown in a scenario representing a factory environment, but since it is modular, it can be easily adapted and extended for other contexts, allowing for simple integration and maintenance.;"[Lopes, Vasco; Pereira, Nuno; Alexandre, Luis A.] Univ Beira Interior, Inst Telecomunicacoes, Rua Marques dAvila & Bolama, P-6201001 Covilha, Portugal";Lopes, V (corresponding author), Univ Beira Interior, Inst Telecomunicacoes, Rua Marques dAvila & Bolama, P-6201001 Covilha, Portugal.;"vasco.lopes@ubi.pt; nuno.pereira@ubi.pt; luis.alexandre@ubi.pt";;;"Tezos Fundation; INDTECH 4.0 New technologies for smart manufacturing [026653 (POCI-01-0247-FEDER-026653)]; Portugal 2020 Program (PT 2020); Compete 2020 Program; European Union through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)European Union (EU)";This work was partially supported by the Tezos Fundation through a grant for project Robotchain and partially supported by project 026653 (POCI-01-0247-FEDER-026653) INDTECH 4.0 New technologies for smart manufacturing, cofinanced by the Portugal 2020 Program (PT 2020), Compete 2020 Program and the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).;;42;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2160-7508;;978-1-7281-2506-0;IEEE COMPUT SOC CONF;;;2019;;;;;;;2812;2820;;10.1109/CVPRW.2019.00340;;;9;Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence;Computer Science;BP9NT;WOS:000569983600334;;;;;2020-12-16;

It presents a panorama of the research that used AI in the area of HR, through the quantitative descriptive analysis of journals and proceedings, registered in the base of the Library of Online Knowledge (B-on), in the period between the years of 2000 and 2018. 32 research publications have been identified that address the application of Artificial Intelligence in the Human Resources area. As a didactic support and aiming to facilitate the understanding of the analysis, the period of the 18 years studied was divided into 3 time periods (First decade, Reduction Period and Period of Growth). The study also raised the distribution of AI application in HR topics and the incidence in each of these themes. As a result, it was concluded that there are few researches on AI applied to Human Resources and a dispersed use behaviour. It is expected that the 9 inferences about the results mentioned in this essay will elicit future studies. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Non-adherence or non-treatment of TB may prolong transmissibility, increase the risk of drug resistance and lead to patient death. One step forward is the use of smartphones for monitoring the medication intake via video (VDOT). VDOT is a more acceptable and cost-effective option than the traditional DOT (in person). However, the VDOT system requires a professional (verifying agent) to check all medication intake daily. Based on an initiative that aims to replace the verifying agent with an artificial intelligence tool capable of validating it automatically through computer vision techniques (AI-based VDOT), the main goal of this work is to measure the acceptance and perception of Brazilian health professionals on the AI-Based VDOT before implementing this technology by using a quantitative questionnaire as instrument. To achieve this, we have developed a proposal of study protocol that describes the steps to create, apply and validate this research. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The Digital Transformation profoundly disrupts existing enterprises and economies. In current times, a lot of new business opportunities appeared using the potential of the Internet and related digital technologies: The Internet of Things, Services Computing, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data with Analytics, Mobile Systems, Collaboration Networks, and Cyber-Physical Systems. Digitization fosters the development of IT environments with many rather small and distributed structures, like the Internet of Things, Microservices, or other micro-granular elements.

However, recent studies have shown these learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e. attacks conducted with images maliciously modified by an algorithm to induce misclassification. Several works have proposed methods for defending against adversarial images, however these defenses have shown to be inefficient, since they have facilitated the understanding of their internal operation by attackers. Thus, this paper proposes a defense called MultiMagNet, which randomly incorporates at runtime multiple defense components, in an attempt to introduce an expanded form of non-deterministic behavior so as to hinder evasions by adversarial attacks. Experiments performed on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets prove that MultiMagNet can protect classification models from adversarial images generated by the main existing attacks algorithms.;"[Machado, Gabriel R.; Goldschmidt, Ronaldo R.] Mil Inst Engn IME, Sect Comp Engn SE 8, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Silva, Eugenio] State Univ West Zone UEZO, Comp Ctr UComp, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil";Machado, GR (corresponding author), Mil Inst Engn IME, Sect Comp Engn SE 8, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.;;;;Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil (CAPES)CAPES [001];The present work has been conducted with the support of the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil (CAPES) - Finacing Code 001.;;35;0;0;0;0;SCITEPRESS;SETUBAL;AV D MANUELL, 27A 2 ESQ, SETUBAL, 2910-595, PORTUGAL;;;978-989-758-372-8;;;;2019;;;;;;;307;318;;10.5220/0007714203070318;;;12;Computer Science, Information Systems;Computer Science;BP9PY;WOS:000570430600032;;Other Gold;;;2020-12-16;

As an exemplary use-case, the construct of perceived 'Health-related Quality of Life' is chosen to show, firstly, the significance of Real World Data and, secondly, the associated 'Real World Evidence'. We settled on an iterative methodology and used hermeneutics for a detailed literature analysis to outline the relevance and the need for a forward-thinking approach to deal with Real World Evidence in the life science and health care industry. The novelty of the study is its focus on a human-centered artificial intelligence, which can be achieved by using 'System Dynamics' modelling techniques. The outcome - a human-centered 'Indicator Set' can be combined with results from data-driven, AI-based analytics. With this multidimensional approach, human intelligence and artificial intelligence can be intertwined towards an enriched Real World Evidence. The developed approach considers three perspectives - the elementary, the algorithmic and - as novelty - the human-centered evidence.

Such optimal mesh router placement ensures desired network performance concerning network connectivity and coverage area. As the problem is NP hard, a motivation to solve the mesh router placement problem and seek optimal solution with suitable performance is to follow a heuristic approach using evolutionary techniques involving genetic algorithms including fuzzy aggregation. Two case studies are considered in this paper. The first one deals with a genetic algorithm application for spatial layout of routers in a two dimensional, obstacle free, wireless mesh network model. The second one considers a hybrid fuzzy-genetic scheme based on a fuzzy aggregation system that assesses the fitness of a genetic algorithm. The hybrid system carries out the routers layout evolution within an area with localization constraints where the placements of such routers are high cost. The results indicate the feasibility of the proposed method for this type of application.;"[Gouvea Coelho, Pedro Henrique; do Amaral, J. F. M.; Guimaraes, K.

Currently, there are intensive efforts to develop efficient systems for motivational analysis and performance evaluation. Current approaches of measuring motivation are very focused on questionnaires and periodic interviews. These periods are most often greater than 6 months, and in most cases performed annually. With today's communication dynamics, employees can be influenced at any time by external factors of market supply and demand, as well as communications with peers and colleagues in the device mesh. It is becoming increasingly important to obtain real-time information to take preventive or corrective measures in a timely manner. This paper proposes a framework for real-time motivational analysis using artificial intelligence techniques in order to evaluate employee' motivation at work. The motivation is evaluated from different groups of indicators: a static and periodic group (interviews and questionnaires), and two other dynamic groups that collect information in real time. With the results generated by the system, it is possible to make important decisions, such as understanding the emotional interactions among employees, improving working conditions, identifying indicators of dissatisfaction and lack of motivation, encouraging promotions, salary adjustments and other situations.;"[Haendchen Filho, Aluizio] Univ Itajai Valley UNIVALI, Lab Appl Intelligence, Rua Uruguay 458, Itajai, SC, Brazil; [Haendchen Filho, Aluizio; Sartori, Simone] Univ Ctr Brusque UNIFEBE, Brusque, Brazil; [do Prado, Hercules Antonio; Ferneda, Edilson] Catholic Univ Brasilia UCB, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Koehntopp, Paulo Ivo] Catarinense Assoc Educ Fdn ACAFE, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil";Haendchen, A (corresponding author), Univ Itajai Valley UNIVALI, Lab Appl Intelligence, Rua Uruguay 458, Itajai, SC, Brazil.;;;;;;;19;0;0;0;0;SCITEPRESS;SETUBAL;AV D MANUELL, 27A 2 ESQ, SETUBAL, 2910-595, PORTUGAL;;;978-989-758-372-8;;;;2019;;;;;;;446;453;;10.5220/0007744304460453;;;8;Computer Science, Information Systems;Computer Science;BP9PY;WOS:000570430600047;;Other Gold;;;2020-12-16;

In this era of digital transformation, manufacturing execution system (MES) is emerging as a critical software tool to support production planning and control while accessing the shop floor data. However, application of MES as an enterprise information system still lacks the decision support capabilities on the shop floor. As an attempt to design intelligent MES, this paper demonstrates one of the artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the manufacturing domain by presenting a decision support mechanism for MES aimed at production coordination. Machine learning (ML) was used to develop an anomaly detection algorithm for multi-agent based MES to facilitate autonomous production execution and process optimization (in this paper switching the machine off after anomaly detection on the production line). Thus, MES executes the 'turning off' of the machine without human intervention. The contribution of the paper includes a concept of next-generation MES that has embedded AI, i.e., a MES system architecture combined with machine learning (ML) technique for multi-agent MES.

However, news media has been shown to be ideologically biased, often negatively shaping the readers' point of view. News on controversial issues makes the bias of the newspaper or its writers more visible. This study aims to measure the objectivity of newspapers by classifying news articles from three newspaper agencies covering the 2017 Battle of Marawi in Southern Philippines. We used Aylien Sentiment Analysis Tool to detect the bias or polarity in each news article (whether positive, negative or neutral). Negative articles on Marawi dominated the three broadsheets (45.1% to 59.9%) while the neutral articles were the least frequent (16.1% to 21.2%). These results indicate that newspapers apply unequal space on the different sides of an issue, which may lead to unbalanced reporting. We also note that despite the varying number of total articles, the three papers applied the same proportion of positive, negative and neutral articles, which may imply collusion. The emergence of Big Data greatly increases the speed of gathering news articles on any given issue, while the Internet of Things enables readers and journalists to measure the objectivity of the news.;"[Valdeavilla, Dexter Dave R.; Pulido, Maria Teresa R.] Mapua Univ, Dept Phys, Intramuros, Manila 1002, Philippines";Valdeavilla, DDR (corresponding author), Mapua Univ, Dept Phys, Intramuros, Manila 1002, Philippines.;;;;IoTBDS 2019 Conference;We thank Mr. Carl Vincent M.

Despite the growing number of industrial and research initiatives aimed at implementing autonomous driving, none of them can claim, yet, to have reached the same driving performance of a human driver. In this paper, we will try to build upon the reasons why the human brain is so effective in learning tasks as complex as the one of driving, borrowing explanations from the most established theories on sensorimotor learning in the field of cognitive neuroscience. The contribution of this work would like to be a new point of view on how the known capabilities of the brain can be taken as an inspiration for the implementation of a more robust artificial driving agent. In this direction, we consider the Convergence-divergence Zones (CDZs) as the most prominent proposal in explaining the simulation process underlying the human sensorimotor learning. We propose to use the CDZs as a template for the implementation of neural network models mimicking the phenomenon of mental imagery, which is considered to be at the heart of the human ability to perform sophisticated sensorimotor controls such driving.;"[Plebe, Alice] Univ Trento, Dept Informat Engn & Comp Sci, Trento, Italy; [Dona, Riccardo; Papini, Gastone Pietro Rosati; Da Lio, Mauro] Univ Trento, Dept Ind Engn, Trento, Italy";Plebe, A (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Dept Informat Engn & Comp Sci, Trento, Italy.;;Papini, Gastone Pietro Rosati/K-8984-2019;"Papini, Gastone Pietro Rosati/0000-0003-1075-9603; Plebe, Alice/0000-0001-8567-0553; Da Lio, Mauro/0000-0002-6619-9484";European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [731593];This work was developed inside the EU Horizon 2020 Dreams4Cars Research and Innovation Action project, supported by the European Commission under Grant 731593.;;40;3;3;0;0;SCITEPRESS;SETUBAL;AV D MANUELL, 27A 2 ESQ, SETUBAL, 2910-595, PORTUGAL;;;978-989-758-374-2;;;;2019;;;;;;;43;51;;10.5220/0007657500430051;;;9;Transportation Science & Technology;Transportation;BP9PO;WOS:000570379100005;;Other Gold, Green Published;;;2020-12-16;

We also report the outcome of an AI versus experts comparison workshop conducted with our algorithm and seasoned experts from a specialized traffic engineering office. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithmic scheme significantly outperforms expert efforts. Our system entails a memetic (genetic+gradient) calibration module to adapt the Origin/Destination (O/D) matrix to current traffic conditions, an inoculation procedure to incorporate existing traffic light programs, genetic multi-objective optimization capabilities and sound metrics. Experiments are conducted over several real world datasets of operational sizes from the Paris outskirts and various other French urban areas. Our experimental outcome is threefold. First, we report the success of the memetic calibration module in adjusting the simulator's O/D matrix to a point with variation levels corresponding to recorded sensor data. Second, we confirm the ability of the system to obtain significant gains on that sound basis: gains ranging from 15% to 35% are consistently reached on both traffic jams reduction and pollutant emissions. Most importantly, we report the outcome of the comparison workshop: a formalized methodology followed by experts to manually optimize traffic lights, iterative experimental logs tracing the application of that methodology to two real world cases and comparable results obtained by the algorithm on the same cases. Results indicate that the AI module performs significantly better than experts in both speed and final solution quality.;"[Semet, Yann] Thales Res & Technol, 1 Ave Augustin Fresnel, Palaiseau, France; [Berthelot, Benoit; Isberie, Christian; Varest, Aurelien] CDVIA, 2 Rue Suchet, Maisons Alfort, France; [Glais, Thierry] Thales Commun & Secur, Rue Mare Joncs, Bretigny Sur Orge, France";Semet, Y (corresponding author), Thales Res & Technol, 1 Ave Augustin Fresnel, Palaiseau, France.;;;;BPIFrance;The authors would like to thank the LaSDIM project and BPIFrance for funding part of this work under the 20th FUI call.

Smart mobility allows tourists to become more comfortable with transportation in an unknown city by providing interesting information about places seen during their trip. Traditional taxies provide quick transportation from the point A to point B but people sometimes are interested in seeing attractions during their trips and are willing to spend more time and money to do so. Integration of the smartphone application with the vehicle infotainment system provides opportunities of new smart services construction that is based on information from vehicle sensors and Internet connection as well as utilization of in-cabin infrastructure and communication with the driver (suggesting the route preferred by the tourist, speed while going around attractions, adjust the temperature, music, and etc.).

However, we should expect a period when full or partial autonomous vehicles and ordinary cars coexist, during which it would be essential to fully understand the cognitive processes used by ordinary people when driving. We identify as a crucial aspect the shift between quick and automated reactions, and the resort to mentalizing, costly social processes, sometimes necessary to predict intentions of other road users.

In recent years, high resolution images are applied in wide fields of artificial intelligence to satisfy various scenes, such as tele-observation, 3D environment reconstruction and road detection. But most common methods are based on complicated matching algorithm processing. The result has high precision but also costs much time to deal with images captured by cameras. However, the optical circle-imaging system in this paper only applies simple cropping and splicing to image matrix instead of feature points matching among images captured by different cameras or at different angles. And in order to carry out the calibration and adjust positions of cameras in this system, we design an improved template consisting of three identical chessboards with settled relationship between every two boards.

For small-scale systems, explicit measurements are carried out to collect Nx (N-1) latency values to cover any pairs of nodes in the network. But this is not practical for large-scale systems due to the significant traffic and processing overhead needed for actual end-to-end latency measurements. Therefore, instead of actual measurements, researchers have proposed to estimate the round-trip times (RTT) to predict the latencies between all nodes within a network based on a small set of actual RTT measurements. However, such methods not only assume that the network is symmetric, which is not necessarily the case in reality, but also require time to converge. In this work, we present a novel method of network latency estimation using Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning, which not only does not require any explicit measurements, but is also drastically faster than existing methods. Our method is trained using the well-known iConnect-Ubisoft dataset of actual RTT measurements, and uses the IP address as the primary input.

This project's goal was to develop an intelligence system that can both read and classify EEG signals from a subject when he/she performs a facial gesture. The intelligence system would be designed to send control signals to a robotic arm to perform specific tasks, such as making a list or grabbing an object. Following data collection, the intelligence system was able to successfully differentiate the signals produced from the various facial gestures. The robotic arm was then programmed to perform a specific gesture associated with each facial gesture, based on the result produced by the intelligence system. Based on the success, additional facial gestures would be added to the intelligence system with the goal of making it more effective.

As remote sensing has evolved towards more complex and drone mountable sensors that are able to capture hyperspectral data including more than 100 spectral bands, equivalently techniques required to process and classify the data have grown more computationally complex as well. The need for extensive computational and memory requirements for data analysis limits the real-time applicability of hyperspectral data collected using limited-resource and portable platforms such as drones in surveillance and swarm robotic applications. As a consequence, the objective of this study is to explore methods to implement Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in a parsimonious manner by using dimensionality reduction, different network architectures, and regularization techniques with respect to its practical applicability in the context of swarm robotics intelligence. The results indicate our proposed spatial-spectral information fusion ANN architecture comprised of only a depth of a few layers, but with many neurons per layer outperformed the models that did not use dimensionality reduction or used too many deep layers to achieve hyperspectral image classification.;"[Foster, Kevin; Menon, Vineetha] Univ Alabama, Dept Comp Sci, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA";Foster, K (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Comp Sci, Huntsville, AL 35899 USA.;"klf0020@uah.edu; Vineetha.Menon@uah.edu";;;;;;17;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;1558-058X;;978-1-7281-0137-8;IEEE SOUTHEASTCON;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;8;"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";"Computer Science; Engineering";BP9CS;WOS:000568970200023;;;;;2020-12-16;

In this research, we study the performances of several machine learning algorithms for classifying malware. Ten machine leaning algorithms are used to classify a Microsoft Kaggle data-set consisting of mainly nine malware families identified by their API calls and N-grams signature patterns.

These applications often demand scalable real-time cognitive intelligence and on-the-spot decision making. Current computer systems have been customized for a cloud computing paradigm which often does not meet latency constraints and scalability requirements. To address the limitations of the cloud computing paradigm, the general trend is toward shifting the computation next to data producers at the edge. However, the edge computing paradigm is in the very early stages. Many system-level aspects of edge computing, including algorithms mapping and partitioning across edge computing resources (edge server, and edge nodes) are unknown. New research is required to understand and quantify design dimensions for edge computing. This paper presents a novel edge computing infrastructure for distributed real-time video analytics. This paper presents a holistic solution for co-designing application and edge infrastructure, including edge nodes and edge servers, to enable scalable real-time Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Deep Learning (DL) video analytics across many cameras. For experimental results and evaluation, we focus on the case study of object re-identification across many cameras, which is composed of object detection/classification (TinyYOLOv3), feature extraction, local re-identification, and global re-identification kernels. We evaluate the edge system under three different task mapping and resource allocation configurations. The results present that with the edge nodes (video cameras) more than 32, the only scalable solution is to perform detection/classification (TinyYOLOv3), feature extraction, local re-identification on the edge nodes next to cameras, and execute global re-identification on edge server.;"[Mendieta, Matias; Neff, Christopher; Lingerfelt, Daniel; Beam, Christopher; George, Anjus; Rogers, Sam; Ravindran, Arun; Tabkhi, Hamed] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA";Mendieta, M (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.;"mmendiet@uncc.edu; cneff1@uncc.edu; dlinger2@uncc.edu; cbeam18@uncc.edu; ageorg28@uncc.edu; sroger48@uncc.edu; aravindr@uncc.edu; htabkhiv@uncc.edu";;;;;;14;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;1558-058X;;978-1-7281-0137-8;IEEE SOUTHEASTCON;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;7;"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";"Computer Science; Engineering";BP9CS;WOS:000568970200257;;;;;2020-12-16;

Various similar functionalities and interaction modalities for the robots and the virtual human are developed. Various technologies are incorporated with them to make them intelligent and autonomous. A common platform in the form of an internet of things (IoT) is developed that can integrate the robots and the virtual human for their real-world collaboration. Then, the collaboration between each robot and the virtual human is separately implemented via the common platform based on some control algorithms for finding a hidden object in a homely environment. The collaboration between the robot and the virtual human is evaluated. The status of cybersecurity in the IoT is briefly analyzed. The results show that the collaboration is satisfactory in various terms, which justify their social integration in the form of an IoT.

A key aspect of this research is devising methods to most effectively utilize emerging quantum computing hardware. Research questions include what experiments on early quantum hardware would give the most insight into the potential impact of quantum computing, the design of algorithms to explore on such hardware, and the development of tools to minimize the quantum resource requirements. We survey work relevant to these questions, with a particular emphasis on our recent work in quantum algorithms and applications, in elucidating mechanisms of quantum mechanics and their uses for quantum computational purposes, and in simulation, compilation, and physics-inspired classical algorithms. To our early application thrusts in planning and scheduling, fault diagnosis, and machine learning, we add thrusts related to robustness of communication networks and the simulation of many-body systems for material science and chemistry.

The current litigation request reasonable prediction method has a low accuracy rate, and lacks a method for rationalizing the expectation of heterogeneous and diverse cases; at the same time, based on machine learning methods, some research focus on the rationality judgment of litigation requests. However, the rationality of litigation request feature design, selection and model are still to be explored.

Currently available diagnoses are cumbersome, low in sensitivity and not field-adaptable given the high skill required that are not available in the rural settings where the diseases are majorly prevalent. Democratizing access to diagnosis with a rapid, easy-to-use, accurate diagnosis is critical in currently stepped-up control, pre-elimination and elimination strategies for urinary schistosomiasis. In this paper, we describe the design process of a low-cost smartphone-based microscope for rapid diagnosis of urinary Schistosomiasis. Field research conducted in Nigeria with the active involvement of key stakeholders in the research and development (R&D) process validated our assumptions and enabled the development of our proof-of-concept into a working prototype in three iterative designs steps. Through this design process, we investigated the local development of technical optics for good quality imaging and explored the simplification of sample preparation techniques using commonly available materials. Starting from the first iteration, the output of each design step was used as the input to the subsequent iterations to optimize our system design. Insightful results and input from the field demonstrated that an adaptive design approach was needed to facilitate the rapid development and deployment of point-of-care diagnostic devices for use in low-resource settings. It is our goal that these devices will be locally manufactured in Nigeria to expand access to the test given her huge population and high disease burden, quick repairs, and easy maintenance on the field.;"[Agbana, Temitope; Vdovin, Gleb] Delft Univ Technol, Mech Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Van, G-Young; Diehl, Jan Card] Delft Univ Technol, Ind Design Engn, Delft, Netherlands; [Oladepo, Oladimeji] Univ Ibadan, Coll Med, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Oyibo, Wellington] Univ Lagos, ANDI, Lagos, Nigeria";Agbana, T (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Mech Engn, Delft, Netherlands.;"T.E.Agbana@tudelft.nl; G.Y.Van@tudelft.nl; ooladepo@com.ui.edu.ng; G.V.Vdovine@tudelft.nl; woyibo@unilag.edu.ng; J.C.Diehl@tudelft.nl";;;;;;19;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2377-6919;;978-1-7281-1780-5;IEEE GLOB HUMANIT C;;;2019;;;;;;;366;373;;;;;8;"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Multidisciplinary";"Computer Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering";BP9BG;WOS:000568648200064;;;;;2020-12-16;

Teams that participated in SC2 designed and developed wireless networks, called Collaborative Intelligent Radio networks (CIRNs), to compete with other teams' CIRNs. The scoring system was created to motivate maximizing both their own and other networks' data throughput. To improve the spectrum usage efficiency, teams were encouraged to use Artificial Intelligence, as well as to collaborate with other teams and agree on spectrum usage schedules that work best for all parties. To facilitate this collaboration, DARPA has established the CIRN Interaction Language (CIL) - a language CIRNs can use to communicate with other networks and establish common spectrum goals and ways to achieve them. One of CIL's main functionalities was to enable teams to announce their intended spectrum usage and provide information other teams can use to adapt their own channel selection. While potentially a beneficial concept, CIL's effect on ensemble throughput of all networks was never evaluated, as a proper evaluation framework was never provided by DARPA, since it was not possible to disable it. This paper describes a simplified simulation of the spectrum usage announcement functionality of the CIL, explains the experiments run to evaluate CILs gains, and showcases the obtained results.;"[Stojadinovic, Dragoslav; Maddala, Prasanthi; Seskar, Ivan; Trappe, Wade] Rutgers State Univ, WINLAB, North Brunswick, NJ 08854 USA; [de Figueiredo, Felipe A.

The challenge in developing autonomous cars is to design controllers that can steer a vehicle in the right direction with enough speed. A good controller activates a set of multiple actuators simultaneously. The output of the controller is a function of the sensory inputs. Nowadays, controllers are mostly developed by connecting a car simulator with a machine learning (ML) algorithm. The simulator provides a pragmatic environment for simulated cars. The ML algorithm, on the other hand, does the job of an expert human controller designer; it designs the controllers on behalf of the latter. In our case, we use a famous car racing simulator called TORCS (The Open Racing Car Simulator). This paper proposes a new controller for TORCS that helps cars win races with grace.

The integration of robotic manufacture with machine learning approaches offers the possibility to enable such dynamic changes on the factory floor. While ensuring safety and the possibility of losses of components and waste of material are against their usage. Furthermore, developments in design of virtual environments makes it possible to perform simulations in a virtual environment, to enable human-in-the-loop production of parts correctly the first time like never before. Such powerful simulation and control software provides the means to design a digital twin of manufacturing environment in which trials are completed at almost at no cost. In this paper, ant colony optimization is used to program an industrial robot to avoid obstacles and find its way to pick and place objects during an assembly task in an environment containing obstacles that must be avoided. The optimization is completed in a digital twin environment first and movements transferred to the real robot after human inspection.

In particular, antenna design automation via surrogate model-based optimization (SMBO) methods is attracting a lot of interest due to the efficiency improvement in terms of computational cost. The parallel surrogate model-assisted hybrid differential evolution for antenna optimisation (PSADEA) method is a state-of-the-art SMBO method. In this paper, PSADEA is used to synthesize a compact slotted monopole antenna for ultra wide band body-centric applications. The performance of PSADEA is compared with 2019 Computer Simulation Technology-Microwave Studio (CST-MWS) optimizers: trust region framework (TRF) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO). Results from the comparisons show that PSADEA obtains very satisfactory design solutions for the monopole antenna in all runs using an affordable optimization time in each, whereas the alternative optimizers fail to obtain a satisfactory design solution in all runs. A close agreement between the simulated and measured results for the fabricated prototype of a typical PSADEA synthesized design for the monopole antenna validates the design solution quality of PSADEA.;"[Akinsolu, Mobayode O.; Liu, Bo; Excell, Peter] Wrexham Glyndwr Univ, Fac Arts Sci & Technol, Wrexham LL11 2AW, Wales; [Danjuma, Isah M.; Abd-Alhameed, Raed A.] Univ Bradford, Fac Engn & Informat, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England; [Mistry, Keyur K.; Lazaridis, Pavlos, I] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Comp & Engn, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Zaharis, Zaharias D.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece";Akinsolu, MO (corresponding author), Wrexham Glyndwr Univ, Fac Arts Sci & Technol, Wrexham LL11 2AW, Wales.;"mobayode.akinsolu@glyndwr.ac.uk; i.m.danjuma@bradford.ac.uk; keyur.mistry@hud.ac.uk; b.liu@glyndwr.ac.uk; r.a.a.abd@bradford.ac.uk; p.lazaridis@hud.ac.uk; zaharis@auth.gr; p.excell@glyndwr.ac.uk";"Akinsolu, Mobayode O./ABD-9725-2020; Zaharis, Zaharias/V-7723-2018";"Akinsolu, Mobayode O./0000-0003-1164-5501; Zaharis, Zaharias/0000-0002-4548-282X";;;;27;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-3687-5;;;;2019;;;;;;;299;303;;;;;5;"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Engineering; Telecommunications";BP9AF;WOS:000568620200057;;;;;2020-12-16;

These frameworks allow mitigating the computational complexity of such algorithms by interfacing parallel computing libraries for specific graphic processing units, which are not available on all platforms, especially if embedded. The framework we propose in this paper enables fast prototyping of custom hardware accelerators for deep learning. In particular we describe how to design, evaluate and deploy accelerators for PyTorch applications written in Python and running on PYNQ compatible platforms, which are based on Xilinx Zynq Systems on Chips.

In order to address different types of learners, educators must begin by recognizing individual differences. Differentiated instruction with the use of emerging technology offers the opportunity for teachers to engage students in different ways, while also varying the rate of instruction, complexity levels, and teaching strategies to engage and challenge students. Mixed Reality (MR) is an emerging medium that offers unique affordances by combining physical and virtual worlds and allowing personalized user control of the hybrid reality. This paper provides an introduction to the Mixed Reality (MR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and their possibilities for education. It also presents Clue: A mixed reality application to augment traditional classroom settings into accessible spaces for three main groups of learners: non-native English speakers, students with hearing disabilities and students with language-based learning disabilities.;"[Aljowaysir, Nouf] Havas, New York, NY 10013 USA; [Ozdemir, Tuba Ozkan] New Sch, Animoto, New York, NY USA; [Kim, Taeyeon] New Sch, New York, NY USA";Aljowaysir, N (corresponding author), Havas, New York, NY 10013 USA.;"na1215@nyu.edu; tuba@newschool.edu; tuba@newschool.edu";;;;;;13;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-2404-9;;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;4;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP8ZN;WOS:000568594800026;;;;;2020-12-16;

Recent anomaly detection approaches have adopted machine learning to detect anomalies on the perspective of individual time points more than events. These approaches do not make effective use of the labels of continuous anomaly intervals, nor do they pay attention to the differences among anomaly points. The detection performance is therefore not high enough. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach named ALSR, which uses a label screening model and a relearning model to analyze and utilize the continuous anomaly intervals of KPIs in finer granularity. The label screening algorithm takes advantage of the continuity of anomaly intervals to remove unnecessary data from the training set, so as to better suit to interval oriented anomaly detection. The relearning algorithm reclassifies the true/false positive points within range of detected anomalies, thus effectively reduces the number of false positive points. ALSR uses statistical characteristics and time series models for feature extraction, and the feature set is proved to better describe the characteristics of KPIs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on 25 KPIs, and the total F-score of ALSR is 0.965, which outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches.;"[Jing, Yuhan; Qi, Qi; Wang, Jingyu; Feng, Tongtong; Liao, Jianxin] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China";Jing, YH (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.;"jingyuhan@bupt.edu.cn; qiqi8266@bupt.edu.cn; wangjingyu@bupt.edu.cn; ftt@bupt.edu.cn; liaojx@bupt.edu.cn";;;"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61771068, 61671079, 61471063]; Beijing Municipal Natural Science FoundationBeijing Natural Science Foundation [4182041]";"This work was jointly supported by: (1)National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61771068, 61671079, 61471063); (2)Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation (No.4182041).";;20;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;1530-1346;;978-1-7281-2999-0;IEEE SYMP COMP COMMU;;;2019;;;;;;;855;860;;;;;6;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Telecommunications";BP9AI;WOS:000568621700143;;;;;2020-12-16;

To provide an insight into intelligent manufacturing, this paper takes autonomous manufacturing cell as implementation scenario and proposes a data- and knowledge-driven framework for digital twin manufacturing cell (DTMC), which could support autonomous manufacturing by an intelligent perceiving, simulating, understanding, predicting, optimizing and controlling strategy. In addition, three key enabling technologies including digital twin model, dynamic knowledge bases and knowledge-based intelligent skills for supporting the above strategy are analyzed. Then, the implementing methods of DTMC are introduced through a thus constructed digital twin robot, and the usage of data and knowledge for supporting the automous operations of DTMC is also discussed.

HMI has been widely studied in product lifecycle including product design, manufacturing, and service, but the efficiency and safety still cannot meet the new requirements for smart manufacturing along with new emerging technologies (e.g., big data, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, etc.). Digital twin (DT), as a new technology to realize cyber-physical integration, provides a new chance to address the above problems. Using a five-dimension DT model driven by real-time data, HMI will generate a more flexible interactive mode to improve machine efficiency and operation safety.

Data sharing is a critical element of interoperability of models and other digital artifacts supporting the systems engineering process. Achieving interoperability within systems engineering requires eliminating differences of syntax and semantics to take advantage of automation, augmentation, and artificial intelligence capabilities that will increase process efficiency and artifact quality. This paper describes the development of a process-centric Systems Engineering (SE) reference ontology, based upon ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 Systems and Software Engineering - Life Cycle Processes [1]. The proposed SE reference ontology extends from the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), which is a very small top-level ontology (TLO) designed specifically to support the integration of more specific ontologies that extend from it [2]. A reference ontology is intended to provide a comprehensive representation of the entities in a given domain encapsulating the terminological content of established knowledge. Unlike other systems ontologies, which focus on the target systems, this reference ontology is focused on the systems engineering process, providing context and purpose for the digital artifacts being built and linking the content of artifacts together into one lexicon.

Resource awareness, as a prime prerequisite for offloading decision-making, is critical for achieving efficient collaborative computation performance. In this paper, we consider cost-aware edge resource probing (CERP) framework design for infrastructure-free edge computing wherein a task device self-organizes its resource probing for informed computation offloading. We first propose a multi-stage optimal stopping formulation for the problem, and derive the optimal probing strategy which reveals a nice multi-threshold structure. Accordingly, we then devise a data-driven layered learning mechanism for more practical and complicated application environments. Layered learning enables the task device to adaptively learn the optimal probing sequence and decision thresholds at runtime, aiming at deriving a good balance between the gain of choosing the best edge device and the accumulated cost of deep resource probing. We further conduct thorough performance evaluation of the proposed CERP schemes using both extensive numerical simulations and realistic system prototype implementation, which demonstrate the superior performance of CERP in the diverse application scenarios.;"[Ouyang, Tao; Chen, Xu; Zeng, Liekang; Zhou, Zhi] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China";Ouyang, T (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;"ouyt9@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; chenxu35@mail.sysu.edu.cn; zenglk3@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; zhouzhi9@mail.sysu.edu.cn";;;"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB1001703]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1711265, 61972432, 61802449]; Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams [2017ZT07X355]; Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program [2017GC010465]";"This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under grant No.2017YFB1001703; the National Science Foundation of China (No. U1711265, No. 61972432, No. 61802449); the Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams (No.2017ZT07X355); the Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program No.2017GC010465).";;32;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;1052-8725;;978-1-7281-4403-0;REAL TIM SYST SYMP P;;;2019;;;;;;;380;391;;10.1109/RTSS46320.2019.00041;;;12;Computer Science, Information Systems;Computer Science;BP8WG;WOS:000568160700031;;;;;2020-12-16;

AGVs are connected to a central navigation system which continuously directs the device to its source or destination. Their main features are their flexibility and adaptability to the environment once the AGVs are configured. The main focus of this article is to present the AGV technology based on vision navigation system reinforced by programming code and navigation graphs with the scope of adhering to the latest innovative concepts in terms of efficiency and optimized manufacturing. The topic of vision-based systems being recent to the engineering evolution, several academicians have discussed probabilities for improvement: some introduce the concept of an independent robot which can learn through artificial intelligence about the dynamic environment or others state, that a neural network can be used in the future as the basis for movement of the AGV in the workspace.;"[Bizubac, Dan; Hormann, Bernd Otto; Popa, Marcel Sabin] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Dept Mfg Engn, Muncii Blvd 103-105, Cluj Napoca, Romania";Bizubac, D (corresponding author), Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Dept Mfg Engn, Muncii Blvd 103-105, Cluj Napoca, Romania.;danbizubac@yahoo.com;;;;;;8;0;0;0;0;E D P SCIENCES;CEDEX A;17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE;2261-236X;;978-2-7598-9083-5;MATEC WEB CONF;;;2019;299;;;;;;;;2010;10.1051/matecconf/201929902010;;;6;Engineering, Manufacturing;Engineering;BP8WD;WOS:000568128200023;;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2020-12-16;

To match this trend, edge intelligence-an emerging paradigm that hosts AI applications at the network edge-is being recognized as a promising solution. While pilot efforts on edge intelligence have mostly focused on facilitating efficient model inference at the network edge, the training of edge intelligence model has been greatly overlooked. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we investigate how to coordinate the edge and the cloud to train edge intelligence model, with the goal of simultaneously optimizing the resource cost and preserving data privacy in an on-demand manner. Leveraging Lyapunov optimization theory, we design and analyze a cost-efficient optimization framework to make online decisions on training data scheduling to balance the tradeoff between cost efficiency and privacy preservation. With rigorous theoretical analysis, we verify the efficacy of the presented framework.;"[Zhou, Zhi; Chen, Xu] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou 51006, Peoples R China";Zhou, Z (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Guangzhou 51006, Peoples R China.;"zhouzhi9@mail.sysu.edu.cn; chenxu35@mail.sysu.edu.cn";;;;;;10;0;0;0;0;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-31919-9; 978-3-030-31918-2";LECT NOTES COMPUT SC;;;2019;11821;;;;;;321;329;;10.1007/978-3-030-31919-9_19;;;9;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP8UX;WOS:000568100600019;;;;;2020-12-16;

We provide a novel solution for the management of building infrastructures in indoor spaces. The use case has been the University of Jaen to visualize correctly their service facilites from AR. To this end, firstly, the CAD models (2D) have been segmented in order to simplify its geometry. As a result, an efficient data structure has been created for real-time alignement to scanned data. Secondly, we have developed a mobile application based on ARCore library to capture and generate 3D planes of the user environment. Finally, we have carried out a method to align automatically the virtual elements such as walls, doors and grounds to the real world.

The network of software-controllable fast-adapting radars follows a highly complex control and operation logic. It is not straightforward to assess its instantaneous capability to detect, track, and recognize targets. To be able to predict or optimize the system performance, one has to understand its behavior not only on a general level, but also in various operating conditions and considering the target behavior and properties accurately. In this paper, we propose the fusion of radar and tracker recordings with an extensive database of cooperative aircraft navigation recordings and radar cross section data to assess and learn the performance measures for the air surveillance. The main contribution of this paper is the incorporation of the aircraft kinematics, orientation, and radar cross section into an automated measurement-based analysis.

To achieve this goal, it is necessary to construct a model which holds information about the state of the environment based on sensor measurements. In common state estimation systems like Kalman filters, it is necessary to explicitly model state transitions and the observation process. These models have to match the internal dynamics of the observed system as closely as possible to yield reliable estimation results. In this work, we propose a method that can learn an approximation of the internal dynamics of a system, without the need to explicitly model these processes. Our system even works on highly complex data like frames of a video sequence. The approach is based on a latent variable model with a continuous hidden state space. To deal with the fact that the estimated processes are sequential, we use recurrent neural networks. As an example to show the potential of this system, resulting predicted future frames of short video sequences are shown. The proposed system shows a general approach for state estimation without the need for any knowledge about the underlying state transition or observation processes.;"[Kornfeld, Nils] German Aerosp Ctr, Inst Transportat Syst, Berlin, Germany; [Feng, Zachary] McGill Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ, Canada";Kornfeld, N (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr, Inst Transportat Syst, Berlin, Germany.;"nils.kornfeld@dlr.de; zachary.feng@mail.mcgill.ca";;;"DAAD Rise Germany internship; Mitacs Globalink Research Awards; Antje Graupe Pryor International Awards";This work was supported by the DAAD Rise Germany internship, Mitacs Globalink Research Awards, and Antje Graupe Pryor International Awards.;;24;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-0-9964527-8-6;;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;8;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";"Computer Science; Engineering";BP8UG;WOS:000567728800283;;;;;2020-12-16;

These evolving operational contexts demand a full spectrum dynamic response of 'data-to-decision' from IF systems. Traditional information extraction and fusion levels typically address the data end of the spectrum, while recent advancement in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches are being used for the decisions end of the spectrum. However, the IF system behavior emerges from the various complex interactions that take place between different fusion levels (including human interaction), the operational context, and the employed AI/ML techniques. In this paper, we explore this emergent behavior of the IF system and argue that holistic system design and evaluation techniques, as offered by System Engineering (SE), provide means to recognize and characterize this emergent behavior.

In such aspects, information about the production processes is available in real-time, allowing managers to act on digital models and, through them, apply decisions in real systems. Thus, having a mirror model or a Digital Twin enables real-time absorption, simulation and implementation of manufacturing variations from the real environment, allowing faster detection of physical problems, and faster production response. The Digital Twin is a virtual representation of the physical system, which is equipped with sensors and actuators and feed the digital system, where the monitoring of data and simulation of variations, for instance, take place. From the synchronized interactions of both components, it is possible to deliver the mentioned faster production responses. Brazilian and German universities joined efforts to develop a Digital Twin based on product lifecycle to support the Manufacturing Process to address these challenges. The proposed Digital Twin seeks to integrate the product twin and the twin of its development process. It shall represent the manufacturing process, enabling the monitoring and optimization of the real production process. The Digital Twin itself is addressed as a product inside the production system and, therefore, its development process will follow the product lifecycle perspective, from the conception and planning to its implementation and usage. The Digital Twin will be further improved with the introduction of Artificial Intelligence tools, characterizing a Smart Digital Twin of the Manufacturing Process.

Within the waste management industry, there are several factors that have to be considered when a particular city needs to develop an optimal system for the collection, treatment and disposal of its MSW; and these factors differ from one city to another. Reflecting on the current trend of thinking with the Industry 4.0 in line with internet of things (IOT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, etc. designing an optimal and sustainable Municipal Solid Waste Management System (MSWMS) has become even more challenging and city-specific. The aim of this paper is to statistically analyze demographic, geographic, economic and technical parameters that substantially affect the design of an optimal and sustainable MSWMS in the context of the fourth Industrial Revolution. South Africa is considered as a case study, and a statistical analysis methodology was applied using Microsoft Excel 2016. The analysis generated the regression equation as well as the correlation between municipal waste production and the economic, demographic and geographic variables. Finally, the paper presents a conceptual framework for the design of an optimal MSWMS for a developing city, in the context of Industry 4.0. The paper makes mainly use of secondary data collected from previous articles, official governmental reports, and Census to conduct the statistical analysis. The literature review revealed that the quantity of waste generated, available air space, city roads traffic, the distance between municipal waste production nodes and different waste treatment (disposal) facilities, the capacity of waste transportation vehicles are among the most critical parameters for the optimal design of MSWMS; and the results of this study showed that the most determinant factors impacting these parameters are the city's Gross Domestic Product contribution and its population density.

Technological progress especially in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, big data and business analytics, as well as augmented and virtual reality are providing a total digital connectivity and new possibilities for effective data analysis and handling. Enterprises expect higher productivity and opportunities for optimized performance by increasing use and integration of innovative technologies. Not only machines or intelligent algorithms are going to execute tasks, but new forms of human-machine interaction represent valuable enablers for positioning the central role of humans in design and development activities. In this paper, the authors present an overview of currently available technological solutions in the field of AI leading to new forms of human-machine interaction. Furthermore, functionalities of these technologies and development needs for generating ideas in early innovation processes are identified. The results of this first study build the basis for the next step aiming at mapping the analysed systems with current creativity techniques and methods for optimisation of the innovation process.

Several techniques such as GAN (Generative Adversarial Nets), SFM (Structure from Motion) and MVS (Multi-View Stereo) are employed to automate 3D design. 3D-GAN is one such method that allows the fully automated design of 3D objects using deep artificial neural networks. However, such generated 3D objects often suffer from distortions, obscure/missing parts, and other artefacts. For a large number of generated models, it becomes time-consuming for the human expert to select models of high quality among the set of generated ones. In this paper, we tackle this problem through machine learning powered 3D model quality assessment algorithm, that mimics the users preferences. For our experiments, we generate 3D objects using 3D-GAN and investigate several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting, Deep Neural Networks to classify generated models based on their visual appealability. We find that our model successfully mimics user choices with 90% accuracy, thus eliminating the need for human intervention in the subjective quality analysis, once user preferences have been learned. The proposed system can be seamlessly integrated into existing automated 3D design systems further augmenting the capabilities of human designers. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The increased data availability coupled with affordable computing power and easy-to-use software tools have laid the foundation for using such algorithms in a wide range of industrial applications, e.g. for predictive maintenance, predictive quality or machine vision. However, a systematic guideline for identifying and implementing economically viable ML use cases in manufacturing industry is still missing. In particular, there is still a lack of a structured overview of concrete, industry-specific best practices that can be easily transferred to one' s own production. Hence, this paper aims to summarize various existing application scenarios of ML from a process and an industry sector perspective. The process point of view mainly covers the main manufacturing process groups of DIN 8580, handling operations according to VDI 2860 as well as selected cross-process approaches. From an industry sector perspective, application scenarios from various subsectors such as the production of electronics, electric motors, transmission components and medical devices are outlined.

The flexibility of the system is increased by the ability of the mobile robots to easily re-locate themselves inside the shopfloor for performing various assembly operations. This paper presents a multi level decision making framework targeting on the dynamic work balancing among the human operators and robot resources. The proposed mechanism exploits Artificial Intelligence techniques for generating efficient task sequences while ensuring optimal and collision free path generation for the assigned resources. The focus is given on the integration of multi- criteria decision-making mechanisms with mobile robots' low-level planning modules for deriving effective reconfiguration plans considering the shopfloor real time status. The developments have been tested in a case study from the automotive industry. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The design process and know-how of engineers is strongly individual and a rule-based description of their approach can often not be done at all or only with high effort. Existing knowledge can therefore only be passed on to other engineers with difficulty, which in particular increases the effort required for familiarisation. A further problem is the lack of an overview of existing components within a company, which very often leads to multiple designs and unnecessary waste of time for the engineer. The aim of this approach is to extract the implicit knowledge from existing CAD models with the aid of machine learning methods and thus to make it formalizable In addition, a suitable classification and similarity analysis should quickly point out existing components. For this purpose, an AI-based assistance system is to be created. Based on the existing database, the assistant first points out to the engineer already existing, but very similar components. For that, the component type currently in construction firstly is identified and then very similar components are searched within the detected scale that are finally suggested to the engineer. The engineer now only has to parameterize the proposed components according to his application. In a further step, the assistant should also be able to suggest useful next design steps, which it has learned on the basis of the CAD data already available and their design history. The implicit experience knowledge that is contained in the existing CAD models thus ensures a design suitable for production and the avoidance of errors in the design. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Manufacturing consumes a significant amount of energy and releases a large amount of waste (solid, liquid and gas), resulting in the substantial stress on the environment. Negative environmental impact is due to a large amount of energy consumption by the machine tools in discrete manufacturing processes like turning, milling and drilling etc. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization model to optimize the machining parameters in turning process. Two objectives, surface roughness and power consumption are simultaneously optimized. The machining parameters are cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut. Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is used to identify the optimal turning parameters and the obtained results indicate that depth of cut is the most significant factor followed by the feed rate and cutting speed. The results obtained by the TOPSIS approach are compared with the existing grey relational analysis approach results. It is found that both optimization techniques show different optimal values. The confirmations experiments are necessary to select the best optimization approach. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Within the process fibers are injected in a special mold through a movable nozzle by an air stream. This process allows a resource efficient production of near net-shape long fiber-preforms without cutting excess. For the properties of the preforms the mold filling is decisive, but current state of the art lacks methods to monitor mold filling online. In this paper a system for monitoring the mold filling based on image processing methods is presented. Therefor a camera and back-lighting has been integrated into a fiber injection mold. The detected filling level and fiber distribution is passed to the PLC of the fiber injection molding machine, which allows the operator to monitor the current mold filling state by means of a visual display. The image processing approach consists of preprocessing, binarization and segmentation. For the preprocessing and binarization several methods including a k-means algorithm, the Otsu thresholding method and a convolutional artificial neural network have been implemented and evaluated. Additionally the illumination of the mold has been investigated and found to have a very large influence on the quality of the results of all investigated methods. The results of the binarization are evaluated on the basis of ground truth images, where an absolute difference between labeled and binarized images is formed and the number of misinterpreted pixels is counted. Among the investigated methods, the method based on the Otsu threshold has been found to be the most efficient with regard to the achievable performance as well as to the correct detection of the current filling. The investigated approach allows the acquisition of more data about the mold filling process to improve models. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The study used a survey of scientific papers and conferences materials indexed to the database of Web of Science and Scopus and published between the period 2000 and 2018. In addition, it was decided to make an opinion survey conducted with professionals and managers on the use of the tool as facilitator of the recruitment and selection process and impacts on HRM, contributing to the strategic positioning of the area within the organizations. Data was collected, through survey questionnaires applied between March and May 2019. A total of 150 questionnaires were collected. A quantitative descriptive analysis was performed to analyse the perception of the professionals about AI in HR, as well as the use of this technology in the automation of processes and contributions when used in R&S processes. Of the 150 respondents, 74% are female, 61% are over 36 years old, 67.3% works in the service sector, and about 49% perform functions in the area of Human Resources.

National armies are focusing its efforts to enhance military capabilities for those units that meet requirements of the full range of military commitments on the contemporary battlefield. Modern armies need to have guidance into the Transformation Roadmap that describes the path the army is taking to adapt its institutions and capabilities. Each national army turns to operational experience, in order to develop operational concepts and capabilities that ought to be sustained interoperability between comparable European armies. The army transformation develops the force structure as to achieve full joint interdependence between European armies. What the EU member states need to do to achieve common military capability goals? What can we expect from the EU member states' contributions - maybe they will invest more into national capabilities? International obligations and agreements are respected between the EU states inside military relations but the major plan, to constitute the European army had failed politically, after the proposal of the EU Constitution was rejected at the referendums in France and in the Netherlands in 2005, respectively. If state investments will not be provided, or modern military capabilities than army transformation could stop. Therefore, the EU needs to rebuild a new command staff intelligence program, which will distribute, dispatch, dislocate, dislodge, and supply modern armies on versatile battlefields around the globe under artificial C4I architecture platform command. This military program, at strategic level, as the third generation of transformation paradigm will use human brains to automatically command and control both to unmanned robotics systems and to military troops on the ground, in the Earth's space, at the sea and in the air, by using selective weapons systems.;"[Peternelj, Bostj An] Fac Social Sci, Def Matters, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Kurecic, Petar] Univ North, Dept Journalism, Trg Zarka Dolinara 1, Koprivnica, Croatia";Peternelj, BA (corresponding author), Fac Social Sci, Def Matters, Ljubljana, Slovenia.;"peternelj.bostjan@gmail.com; petar.kurecic@unin.hr";;;;;;25;0;0;0;0;VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY;VARAZDIN;MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA;1849-6903;1849-7535;;EC SOC DEVELOP;;;2019;;;;;;;160;168;;;;;9;"Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning";"Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration";BP8TM;WOS:000567298100017;;;;;2020-12-16;

But the educational game is not popular to users. Therefore, it takes innovation and other ways to improve the educational game itself. Based on the current user survey, games that have dynamic elements such as artificial intelligence are sufficiently requested by users. For this reason, this study aims to build educational games that implement artificial intelligent (AI). In a game, AI is often implemented as Non-Player Character (NPC). The method used for NPCs in this game is based on the Natural Language Processing approach. This is so that the NPC can answer questions about English automatically. The results show that the educational game that has this NPC gets an average score above 75% of users. In addition, users also provide positive feedback on the game itself apart from the questionnaire. So it can be concluded that the presence of NPCs in educational games can increase user interest. With this new approach, it is hoped that it can also increase the popularity ranking of the educational game genre. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Its NP-hard nature makes this problem attractive to be studied, especially in the field of operation research and artificial intelligence. In the literature, the state-of-the-art approach for solving examination timetabling problem is meta-heuristics. However, this approach has limitation, i.e. the need for intensive problem-specific parameter tuning. To cope with this problem, a relatively new approach namely hyperheuristics was proposed. Different from meta-heuristics that search upon solution space, hyper-heuristics search upon low-level space. This strategy makes hyper-heuristics more generic that works over cross-domain, compared to meta-heuristics that usually designed for specific problem domain. This paper reports the success of solving real-world university examination timetabling problem in Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember using hyper-heuristics based on great deluge algorithm. The main contributions of this study are two folds: a new dataset and new approach for solving examination timetabling problem. The computational results show that the proposed algorithm could produce much better solutions compared to the solutions generated manually. In addition, the proposed algorithm also outperforms two benchmarking algorithms, namely hill climbing and simulated annealing algorithms. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, a concept is proposed, that uses active grid analysis to detect wire and device faults as well as their location in the grid topology. Instead of the passive grid analysis, the presented approach applies the measurement hardware at socket outlets. This results in an easier, more flexible and less time-consuming installation. The underlying approach for the active grid analysis is based on reflectometry. Due to some benefits compared to other reflectometry types, spread spectrum time domain reflectometry methods is used and implemented, using software defined radio.

In this regard, methods of measurement of these species include methods and models of artificial intelligence, fuzzy set theory, cognitive theory. From a methodological point of view, this diversity of new types of measurements together with classical ones determines the necessity of their systematization and classification for their effective and purposeful application.

Equally, it has been one of the more challenging areas to see an effective adoption. There are many reasons for this, primarily the reluctance to delegate decision making to machine intelligence in cases where patient safety is at stake. To address some of these challenges, medical AI, especially in its modern data-rich deep learning guise, needs to develop a principled and formal uncertainty quantification (UQ) discipline, just as we have seen in fields such as nuclear stockpile stewardship and risk management. The data-rich world of AI-based learning and the frequent absence of a well-understood underlying theory poses its own unique challenges to straightforward adoption of UQ. These challenges, while not trivial, also present significant new research opportunities for the development of new theoretical approaches, and for the practical applications of UQ in the area of machine-assisted medical decision making. Understanding prediction system structure and defensibly quantifying uncertainty is possible, and, if done, can significantly benefit both research and practical applications of AI in this critical domain. Arguably one of the most promising as well as critical applications of deep learning is in supporting medical sciences and decision making. It is time to develop methods for systematically quantifying uncertainty underlying deep learning processes, which would lead to increased confidence in practical applicability of these approaches.;"[Begoli, Edmon] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA; [Bhattacharya, Tanmoy] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Los Alamos, NM USA; [Kusnezov, Dimitri] US DOE, Washington, DC 20585 USA";Begoli, E (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA.;begolie@ornl.gov;;;UT-Battelle, LLC [DE-AC05-00OR22725];This manuscript has been in part co-authored by UT-Battelle, LLC, under contract no.

An alternative approach comes from the field of neuroevolution, which harnesses evolutionary algorithms to optimize neural networks, inspired by the fact that natural brains themselves are the products of an evolutionary process. Neuroevolution enables important capabilities that are typically unavailable to gradient-based approaches, including learning neural network building blocks (for example activation functions), hyperparameters, architectures and even the algorithms for learning themselves. Neuroevolution also differs from deep learning (and deep reinforcement learning) by maintaining a population of solutions during search, enabling extreme exploration and massive parallelization. Finally, because neuroevolution research has (until recently) developed largely in isolation from gradient-based neural network research, it has developed many unique and effective techniques that should be effective in other machine learning areas too. This Review looks at several key aspects of modern neuroevolution, including large-scale computing, the benefits of novelty and diversity, the power of indirect encoding, and the field's contributions to meta-learning and architecture search. Our hope is to inspire renewed interest in the field as it meets the potential of the increasing computation available today, to highlight how many of its ideas can provide an exciting resource for inspiration and hybridization to the deep learning, deep reinforcement learning and machine learning communities, and to explain how neuroevolution could prove to be a critical tool in the long-term pursuit of artificial general intelligence. Deep neural networks have become very successful at certain machine learning tasks partly due to the widely adopted method of training called backpropagation. An alternative way to optimize neural networks is by using evolutionary algorithms, which, fuelled by the increase in computing power, offers a new range of capabilities and modes of learning.;"[Stanley, Kenneth O.; Clune, Jeff; Lehman, Joel] Uber AI Labs, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA; [Stanley, Kenneth O.] Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Clune, Jeff] Univ Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Miikkulainen, Risto] Sentient Technol, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA; [Miikkulainen, Risto] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA";"Stanley, KO; Clune, J; Lehman, J (corresponding author), Uber AI Labs, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA.; Stanley, KO (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.; Clune, J (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.; Miikkulainen, R (corresponding author), Sentient Technol, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA.; Miikkulainen, R (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.";"kstanley@uber.com; jeffclune@uber.com; Joel.lehman@uber.com; risto.miikkulainen@sentient.ai";;;;;;159;51;51;0;3;SPRINGERNATURE;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND;;2522-5839;;NAT MACH INTELL;Nat.

New types of computer chips that are suited to the task of deep learning, such as memristor arrays where data handling and computing take place within the same unit, are required. A well-used deep learning model called long short-term memory, which can handle temporal sequential data analysis, is now implemented in a memristor crossbar array, promising an energy-efficient and low-footprint deep learning platform. Recent breakthroughs in recurrent deep neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) units have led to major advances in artificial intelligence. However, state-of-the-art LSTM models with significantly increased complexity and a large number of parameters have a bottleneck in computing power resulting from both limited memory capacity and limited data communication bandwidth. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the synaptic weights shared in different time steps in an LSTM can be implemented with a memristor crossbar array, which has a small circuit footprint, can store a large number of parameters and offers in-memory computing capability that contributes to circumventing the 'von Neumann bottleneck'. We illustrate the capability of our crossbar system as a core component in solving real-world problems in regression and classification, which shows that memristor LSTM is a promising low-power and low-latency hardware platform for edge inference.;"[Li, Can; Wang, Zhongrui; Rao, Mingyi; Belkin, Daniel; Song, Wenhao; Jiang, Hao; Yan, Peng; Li, Yunning; Lin, Peng; Yang, J.

However, confidentiality and invisibility are not always constitutive of privacy as the freedom from unreasonable constraints on the construction of one's own identity - in some cases, visibility can be more important, and data collection, presentation, and inferences can help and extend a desired visibility.

Advances are primarily driven by machine learning techniques. Recently, many educational tools for teaching AI have been introduced, allowing the user to implement AI features within pedagogical programming environments. However, many of these existing approaches share a common trait: the implementation of the underlying AI framework remains a black box, where external API calls or servers handle the actual computing. For the user, this typically means there is no chance to see inside the implementation. As a result, users often cannot gain a deeper understanding of how the computer is learning. In this paper, we propose design principles for a framework in order to break open that black box. These design principles are implemented in the first part of SnAIp, a project aimed at enabling Machine Learning within Snap!. The focus of this part is using Reinforcement Learning within Snap! games. The corresponding framework enables constructionist learning and is implemented entirely in Snap!, which allows for a high degree of transparency and tangibility. Furthermore, we present a curriculum for Reinforcement learning using the SnAIp framework. With this, we outline a way to address ML in the classroom using block-based languages, while enabling the all-important look behind the scenes.;"[Jatzlau, Sven; Michaeli, Tilman; Seegerer, Stefan] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Comp Educ Res Grp, Erlangen, Germany; [Romeike, Ralf] Free Univ Berlin, Comp Educ Res Grp, Berlin, Germany";Jatzlau, S (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Comp Educ Res Grp, Erlangen, Germany.;"sven.jatzlau@fau.de; tilman.michaeli@fau.de; stefan.seegerer@fau.de; ralf.romeike@fu-berlin.de";;;;;;21;1;1;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-4849-6;;;;2019;;;;;;;37;41;;;;;5;"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";"Computer Science; Engineering";BP7DY;WOS:000561703300008;;;;;2020-12-16;

Although RL has been applied to many research fields, there are difficulties when implementing it in some real world applications. One difficulty is the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation for the agent of RL in choosing a proper action. An improper action may lead to a learning failure or an increase in learning cost. Another difficulty is that the learning agent of RL needs to interact with the environment to attain a real-time reward/penalty; however, the learning time spent in the interaction process may be too long. In order to overcome the aforementioned difficulties, this paper proposes an approach that employs a personalized recommendation system to provide a feedforward candidate action for RL to implement self-adaptive learning through teaching.

However, their high computational complexity and storage demands limit their efficient deployment on resource-limited embedded systems and IoT devices. To address this problem, in recent years a wide landscape of customized FPGA-based hardware acceleration solutions has been presented in literature, focused on combining high performance and power efficiency. Most of them are implemented on mid- to high-range devices including different computing cores, and target intensive models such as AlexNet and VGG16. In this work, we implement a CNN inference accelerator on a compact and cost-optimized device, the Minized development board from Avnet, integrating a single-core Zynq 7Z007S. We measure the execution time and energy consumption of the developed accelerator, and we compare it with a CPU-based software implementation. The results show that the accelerator achieves a frame rate of 13 fps on the end-to-end execution of ALL-CNN-C model, and 4 fps on DarkNet. Compared with the software implementation, it was 5 times faster providing up to 10.62 giga operations per second (GOPS) at 80 MHz while consuming 1.08 W of on-chip power.;"[Meloni, Paolo; Garufi, Antonio; Deriu, Gianfranco; Carreras, Marco; Loi, Daniela] Univ Cagliari, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy";Meloni, P (corresponding author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.;paolo.meloni@unica.it;;;European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [780788];This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 780788.;;15;0;0;1;1;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2164-9766;;978-1-7281-4074-2;CONF DESIGN ARCHIT;;;2019;;;;;;;7;12;;;;;6;"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";"Computer Science; Engineering";BP8HR;WOS:000565678000002;;;;;2020-12-16;

Hence, sound knowledge about principles and concepts of AI and Robotics are key skills for the 21st century. Nonetheless, hardly any systematic approaches exist that focus on teaching AI/Robotics principles at K-12 level, addressing both teachers and students. In order to meet this challenge, the European Driving License for Robots and Intelligent Systems is under development. It is based on a number of previously implemented and evaluated projects and comprises teaching curricula and training modules for AI/Robotics, following a competency based, blended learning approach. Additionally, a certification system proves peoples' competencies acquired during the training.

Due to the evolution of technologies in educational and professional contexts, new teaching/learning methods have been an emerging demand for today's society. The expansion of learning modalities such as face-to-face, combined and distance learning as well as demand anywhere, at any time, has been a premise in these education systems. With the advancement of virtual learning environments (VLEs), successful interaction depends on solutions that enable efficient communication between the student and the educational context. One way to achieve this goal has been to use chatbots to respond to students' questions in the educational field. This has become possible through artificial intelligence and natural language processing embodied in simple service platforms. The purpose of this article is to develop a chatbot that interacts with students through text messages, on subjects in a closed context, to students' doubts about the Higher Education Institution Course. To validate chatbot performance, it will be submitted to a set of questions of the same context that were not correctly answered in the previous interactions. The results of these interactions will be analyzed in order to verify the efficiency and contribution of a chatbot as a support tool for the student. It is hoped that this study contributes to solutions for assistance automation in the learning context.;"[Oliveira, Jeferson da Silva; Espindola, Dannbia Bueno; Barwaldt, Regina; Ribeiro, Luciano Maciel] Fed Univ Rio Grande, Ctr Computat Sci, Rio Grande, Brazil; [Pias, Marcelo] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Computat Sci, Cambridge, England";Oliveira, JD (corresponding author), Fed Univ Rio Grande, Ctr Computat Sci, Rio Grande, Brazil.;"oliveirajs@furg.br; dmtdbe@furg.br; reginabarwaldt@furg.br; lucianomacielribeiro@gmail.com; pias.marcelo@gmail.com";;;;;;21;0;0;1;1;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;0190-5848;;978-1-7281-1746-1;PROC FRONT EDUC CONF;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;8;"Education, Scientific Disciplines; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";"Education & Educational Research; Engineering";BP8GE;WOS:000565244800307;;;;;2020-12-16;

Furthermore, other requirements such as the mobility, reliability, scalability and quality of service (QoS) should be considered as well, while designing such networks. To achieve the announced requirements of the 5G systems and overcome the high traffic density problems, new technologies, such as the mobile edge computing (MEC) and software defined networking (SDN), and novel schemes, such as artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and offloading algorithms, should be introduced. One main issue with the 5G networks is the heterogeneous traffic, since there are enormous number of applications and sub-networks. The main design challenge with the 5G network traffic is the recognition and classification of heterogeneous massive traffic, which cannot be performed by the current traditional methods. Instead, new reliable methods based on AI should be introduced. To this end, this work considers the problem of traffic recognition, controlling and management; mainly for ultra-dense 5G networks. In this paper, a novel AI algorithm is developed to detect and recognize the heterogeneous traffic at the core network.

This effect can be useful in wind energy systems with composite blades for improving the rotor operational range as a passive control strategy. However, it is difficult to design such structures in order to attain a desired angle when bent. This paper proposes a metamodel-based methodology to design laminates with bend-twist coupling effect by means of genetic algorithms (GA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) integrated with a finite element model (FEM) capable of defining the stacking sequence that a laminate needs to reach a certain twist angle when submitted to bending load. The genetic algorithm uses a deterministic tournament for selection, a two-point method for crossover and an ANN trained with FEM simulations is used as the fitness function for reducing computational time. This strategy could ease the design of this type of structures in practical scenarios.;"[Restrepo-Montoya, Daniel; Alvarez-Montoya, Joham; Sierra-Perez, Julian] Univ Pontificia Bolivariana, Grp Invest Ingn Aeroespacial, Medellin, Colombia; [Nieto-Londono, Cesar] Univ Pontificia Bolivariana, Grp Energia & Termodinam, Medellin, Colombia";Restrepo-Montoya, D (corresponding author), Univ Pontificia Bolivariana, Grp Invest Ingn Aeroespacial, Medellin, Colombia.;"daniel.restrepomo@upb.edu.co; cesar.nieto@upb.edu.co";;Nieto-Londono, Cesar/0000-0001-6516-9630;;;;17;1;1;1;1;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2380-9329;;978-1-7281-4562-4;CONF POW ENG RENEW;;;2019;;;;;;;155;159;;;;;5;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Engineering";BP8HJ;WOS:000565620900030;;;;;2020-12-16;

Creative feature engineering is an important part of machine learning methodology that supports and manipulates existing data to make it work more efficiently by modifying dimensions of data. Pulling useful information from external sources and combining them, however, are cumbersome since data engineers need to manually find external data sources and process them. Therefore, the ability to modify and enrich existing data automatically, using external open data sources could prove crucial to data engineers and scientists looking to enrich their datasets. In this paper, we propose a method that automatically augments a given structured dataset, by inferencing relevant dimension from an external data source with respect to the target attribute. Specifically, our proposed algorithm first creates bloom filters for every instance of data items. Such filters are then used to retrieve relevant information from the linked open data source, which is later processed into additional columns in the target dataset. A case study of three real-world datasets using Wikidata as the external data source is used to empirically validate our proposed method on both regression and classification tasks. The experimental results show that the datasets augmented by our proposed algorithm yield correlation improvement of 23.11% on average for the regression task, and ROC improvement of 86.50% for the classification task.;"[Taveekarn, Waran; Yimudom, Chatchanin; Sukkanta, Supisara; Sawangphol, Wudhichart; Tuarob, Suppawong] Mahidol Univ, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand; [Lynden, Steven] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Tokyo, Japan";Taveekarn, W (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Fac Informat & Commun Technol, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.;"waran.tav@student.mahidol.ac.th; chatchanin.yim@student.mahidol.ac.th; supisara.sua@student.mahidol.ac.th; steven.lynden@aist.go.jp; wudhichart.saw@mahidol.edu; suppawong.tua@mahidol.edu";;;"Faculty of Information and Communication Technology, Mahidol University; Office of Higher Education Commission (OHEC) ThailandOffice of Higher Education Commission (OHEC); Thailand Research Fund (TRF)Thailand Research Fund (TRF) [RSA6280105]";This research project was partially supported by Faculty of Information and Communication Technology, Mahidol University.

This paper first introduces an energy monitoring and data acquisition system namely the Point Energy Technology, which has been developed by the team and installed in several industrial partners, including a local bakery. The lack of data always exists due to various reasons, such as measurement or transmission errors at data collection and transmission stage, leading to the loss of varied length of data samples that are key for process monitoring and control. To solve this problem, we introduce a generative adversarial framework which is based on a game theory for data augmentation. This framework consists of two multi layer perceptron networks, namely generator and discriminator. An improved framework with Q-net that extracts the latent variables from real data is also proposed, in which the Q-net shares the structure with discriminator except for the last layer. In addition, the two optimization methods, namely mini-batch gradient descent and adaptive moment estimation are adopted to tune the parameters. To evaluate the performance of these algorithms, energy consumption data collected from a bakery process is used in the experiment. The experimental results confirm that the latent generative adversarial framework with adaptive moment estimation could generate good quality data samples to compensate the random loss of samples in time series data.;"[Wang, Yanxia; Li, Kang; Gan, Shaojun] Univ Leeds, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Cameron, Che] Queends Univ Belfast, Sch Elect Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Zheng, Min] Shanghai Univ, Sch Mechatron & Automat, Shanghai, Peoples R China";Wang, YX (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.;"wyxdsky@gmail.com; k.li1@leeds.ac.uk; cqugsj@gmail.com; ccameron07@qub.ac.uk; zhengmin203@shu.edu.cn";;;UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/P004636/1];This research is financially supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under grant EP/P004636/1 'Optimising Energy Management in Industry - OPTEMIN'.;;27;0;0;1;1;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-3593-9;;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;6;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Industrial";"Computer Science; Engineering";BP8EH;WOS:000564554900018;;;;;2020-12-16;

In this paper, we focus on the AI-based damage assessment applications where deep neural network approaches are used to automatically identify damage severity of impacted areas from imagery reports in the aftermath of a disaster (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, landslides). While AI algorithms often significantly reduce the detection time and labor cost in such applications, their performance sometimes falls short of the desired accuracy and is considered to be less reliable than domain experts. To exacerbate the problem, the black-box nature of the AI algorithms also makes it difficult to troubleshoot the system when their performance is unsatisfactory. The emergence of crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Amazon Mechanic Turk, Waze) brings about the opportunity to incorporate human intelligence into AI algorithms. However, the crowdsourcing platform is also black-box in terms of the uncertain response delay and crowd worker quality. In this work, we propose the CrowdLearn, a crowd-AI hybrid system that leverages the crowdsourcing platform to troubleshoot, tune, and eventually improve the black-box AI algorithms by welding crowd intelligence with machine intelligence. The system is specifically designed for deep learning-based damage assessment (DDA) applications where the crowd tend to be more accurate but less responsive than machines. Our evaluation results on a real-world case study on Amazon Mechanic Turk demonstrate that CrowdLearn can provide timely and more accurate assessments to natural disaster events than the state-of-the-art AI-only and human-AI integrated systems.;"[Zhang, Daniel (Yue); Zhang, Yang; Li, Qi; Plummer, Thomas; Wang, Dong] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA";Zhang, D (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.;"yzhang40@nd.edu; yzhang42@nd.edu; qli8@nd.edu; tplumme2@nd.edu; dwang5@nd.edu";;;"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CNS-1831669, CBET-1637251, CNS-1566465, IIS-1447795]; Army Research Office [W911NF-17-1-0409]; Google 2017 Faculty Research Award";This research is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. CNS-1831669, CBET-1637251, CNS-1566465 and IIS-1447795, Army Research Office under Grant W911NF-17-1-0409, Google 2017 Faculty Research Award.

However, several new problems, such as privacy violations, security issues, or effectiveness, have been emerging. Differential privacy has several attractive properties that make it quite valuable for AI, such as privacy preservation, security, randomization, composition, and stability. Therefore, this paper presents differential privacy mechanisms for multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and knowledge transfer based on those properties, which proves that current AI can benefit from differential privacy mechanisms. In addition, the previous usage of differential privacy mechanisms in private machine learning, distributed machine learning, and fairness in models is discussed, bringing several possible avenues to use differential privacy mechanisms in AI. The purpose of this paper is to deliver the initial idea of how to integrate AI with differential privacy mechanisms and to explore more possibilities to improve AIs performance.;"[Zhu, Tianqing] China Univ Geosci Wuhan, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Tianqing] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Yu, Philip S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Comp Sci, Chicago, IL USA";"Zhu, TQ (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci Wuhan, Wuhan, Peoples R China.; Zhu, TQ (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.";"tianqing.zhu@uts.edu.au; psyu@uic.edu";;;;;;29;5;5;0;0;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA;1063-6927;;978-1-7281-2519-0;INT CON DISTR COMP S;;;2019;;;;;;;1601;1609;;10.1109/ICDCS.2019.00159;;;9;"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP8GA;WOS:000565234200148;;;;;2020-12-16;

When scheduling these tasks, the ultimate objective is to minimize the makespan of the schedule, which is equivalent to minimizing the job completion time. With task dependencies, however, minimizing the makespan of the schedule is non-trivial, especially when tasks in the DAG have different resource demands with respect to multiple resource types. In this paper, we present Spear, a new scheduling framework designed to minimize the makespan of complex jobs, while considering both task dependencies and heterogeneous resource demands at the same time. Inspired by recent advances in artificial intelligence, Spear applies Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in the specific context of task scheduling, and trains a deep reinforcement learning model to guide the expansion and rollout steps in MCTS. With deep reinforcement learning, search efficiency can be significantly improved by focusing on more promising branches. With both simulations and experiments using traces from production workloads, we compare the scheduling performance of Spear with state-of-the-art job schedulers in the literature, and Spear can outperform those approaches by up to 20%. Our results have validated our claims that MCTS and deep reinforcement learning can readily be applied to optimize the scheduling of complex jobs with task dependencies.;"[Hu, Zhiming; Tu, James; Li, Baochun] Univ Toronto, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada";Hu, ZM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada.;"zhiming@ece.utoronto.ca; james.tu@mail.utoronto.ca; bli@ece.toronto.edu";;;;;;26;0;0;0;0;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA;1063-6927;;978-1-7281-2519-0;INT CON DISTR COMP S;;;2019;;;;;;;2037;2046;;10.1109/ICDCS.2019.00201;;;10;"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP8GA;WOS:000565234200190;;;;;2020-12-16;

The flow rate of centrifugal pump is directly proportional to the speed of induction motor. Induction motor based electric drives are a complex nonlinear system to control due to their varying nature of speed with respect to changes in load. Thus, controllers are required for the speed control and performance enhancement of the induction motors. In this paper, a comparison of various controllers is discussed for the flow rate control of the pumping system. Among all the conventional controllers the proportional integral derivative (PID) is the mostly preferred for induction motor speed control. However, high overshoot, fixed gain constants and sluggish response are the disadvantages of the PID controller. So, automatic gain tuned PI controllers (i.e., adaptive PI controllers) arc introduced to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional PID controllers. Further advancements in the field of artificial intelligence lead to the development of fuzzy logic based controllers. These controllers are simple, compatible and can be modelled without detailed mathematical model of the system. Thus, they are gaining more popularity than other controllers. The rules and membership functions (Ws) are responsible for performance of fuzzy logic controllers are designed using trial and error method. The result comparison of all the controllers is presented and the performance of each controller is analyzed. From the observations, fuzzy logic controller provides better performance than the conventional controllers.;"[Shankar, Arun V.

Such a strategy frequently results in unplanned downtime, owing to unexpected failures. Scheduled maintenance replaces components frequently to avoid unexpected equipment stoppages, but increases the time associated with machine non-operation and maintenance cost. The emergence of Industry 4.0 and smart systems is leading to increasing attention to predictive maintenance (PdM) strategies that can decrease the cost of downtime and increase the availability (utilization rate) of manufacturing equipment. PdM also has the potential to foster sustainable practices in manufacturing by maximizing the useful lives of components. In this paper, the AI-based algorithms for predictive maintenance are presented, and are applied to monitor two critical machine tool system elements: the cutting tool and the spindle motor.

One prominent example application of ML is given by image recognition services that allow to recognize characteristics in images and classify them accordingly. One question that arises, also in light of current debates that are fueled with emotions rather than evidence, is to which extent such ML services can already pass image-based Turing Tests. In other words, can ML services imitate human (cognitive and creative) tasks to an extent that their behavior remains indistinguishable from human behavior? If so, what does this mean from a security perspective? In this paper, we evaluate a number of publicly available ML services for the degree to which they can be used to pass image-based Turing Tests. We do so by applying selected ML services to 10,500 randomly collected captchas including approximately 100,000 images. We further investigate the degree to which captcha solving can become an automated procedure. Our results strengthen our confidence in that today's available and ready-to-use ML services can indeed be used to pass image-based Turing Tests, rising new questions on the security of systems that rely on this image-based technology as a security measure.;"[Zarras, Apostolis] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Gerostathopoulos, Ilias; Fernandez, Daniel Mendez] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany";Zarras, A (corresponding author), Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands.;apostolis.zarras@maastrichtuniversity.nl;;"Gerostathopoulos, Ilias/0000-0001-9333-7101; Zarras, Apostolis/0000-0002-8480-6989";European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [833115];This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 833115 (PREVISION).;;0;0;0;0;0;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-30215-3; 978-3-030-30214-6";LECT NOTES COMPUT SC;;;2019;11723;;;;;;129;148;;10.1007/978-3-030-30215-3_7;;;20;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP8GD;WOS:000565241600007;;;;;2020-12-16;

To overcome the problem of ambiguity in emotion expression, a fuzzy approach is developed to analyze the facial components in determining the type of emotion. In this study, we proposed a framework for fuzzy emotion recognition as a representation of the psychologist knowledge. Three stages in the fuzzy emotion recognition were facial feature extraction with Active Appearance Model; Semantic-linguistic facial features extraction; fuzzy emotion recognition with Fuzzy Emotion Classification. System performance testing provided the best results on extended Cohn Kanade (CK+) facial expression dataset, with the accuracy of linguistic facial component recognition 0.98, and accuracy of fuzzy emotion recognition 0.90. Testing was also performed on custom-made Indonesian Mixed Emotion Dataset (IMED) which resulted in accuracy of 0.87.

Managing these large datasets is one of the critical challenges to be tackled. Continuous huge information collection through sensor-enabled devices is known as the massive IoT (mIoT). Thus, there is a need of self-adaptive artificial intelligence (AI)based strategies to effectively cluster, examine and interpret the entire entities in the system. With increased data volumes and power hungry natured IoT devices it is a dire need to manage their power wisely. To fairly allot the power levels to the tiny portable devices it is important to integrate mIoT with AI-based techniques. To remedy these issues this paper proposes a novel cross-layer based energy optimization algorithm (CEOA) in mIoT system by examining the detailed features and data patterns. Experimental analysis reveals that proposed CEOA outperforms its competing counterpart i.e., Baseline in terms of efficient power management and monitoring.;"[Sodhro, Ali Hassan] Sukkur IBA Univ, Sukkur, Sindh, Pakistan; [Obaidat, Mohammad S.] Nazarbayev Univ, ECE Dept, Astana, Kazakhstan; [Obaidat, Mohammad S.] Univ Jordan, KASIT, Amman, Jordan; [Obaidat, Mohammad S.] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Pirbhulal, Sandeep] Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Sodhro, Gul Hassan] Shah Abdul Latif Univ, Dept Phys, Khairpur Mirs Khairpur, Sindh, Pakistan; [Zahid, Noman] Sukkur IBA Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Sukkur, Sindh, Pakistan; [Rawat, Abhimanyu] Linkoping Univ, IDA Comp & Informat Sci Dept, Linkoping, Sweden";Sodhro, AH (corresponding author), Sukkur IBA Univ, Sukkur, Sindh, Pakistan.;"ali.hassan@iba-suk.edu.pk; mobaidat@gmail.com; sandeep@siat.ac.cn; hassangull183@gmail.com; noman.mece17@iba-suk.edu.pk; abhimanyu.awat@liu.se";;;;;;24;0;0;0;0;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA;;;;;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;6;Computer Science, Software Engineering;Computer Science;BP8EP;WOS:000564683600062;;;;;2020-12-16;

On the one hand, the man modifies (and evolves) the technology according to his needs, on the other the technology revolutionates the man and the way in which it lives. Psychology, therefore, as a discipline afferent to the human sciences, is called to take an interest in this relationship and to understand its complexity. A fundamental role in this sense is covered by cyberpsychology which investigates all those psychological phenomena that are associated with technology and aims to analyse the processes of change triggered by the interaction between man and the new media. From the psychological point of view, if on the one hand it is important to understand how man changes in contact with the new technologies and to what problems he is meeting. On the other hand, there is a need to understand how new technologies, given their transformative potential, can find a place within the therapeutic practice. In this regard, some of the technologies used in the clinical field have been analysed including: virtual reality, biosensors, artificial intelligence and affective computing. With the aim of understanding to what extent and how technological progress and the emergence of new technologies can contribute and generate value within the psychological panorama. Following the PRISMA statement a bibliographic research was carried out, which provided for consultation of the Medline and PsycINFO databases. The criteria according to which works have been selected rather than others refer to their precision and sensitivity with which they propose to treat technological applications in the field of health psychology and from this the emergence of the new theme CYBER HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY. The results of the research suggest that the integrated use of psychological techniques and new technologies is extremely productive in terms of potential improvement of health and therefore of health empowerment. In this vision, new technologies are not intended to replace traditional procedures but to integrate them by making available features and potential that man does not have in nature.

The paper presents the statement of the placement task in designing very large-scale integration circuits (VLSI). The authors propose the algorithm for solving this task on the basis of biological system behavior in nature, e.g. wolf pack. Wolves are considered as typical social animals having clear separation of social work. The paper describes the actions and rules of wolf pack behaviour in nature. Based on the wolves' behaviour rules and actions, the authors present the modified wolf pack algorithm. The benefits of the developed modified algorithm include the ability to improve each following iteration of the placement task. The wolf pack algorithm is implemented as a computer software on Java. To estimate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the authors use the well-known IBM benchmarks to compare with the developed algorithm. The comparison is implemented with the results of the following algorithms: Capo 8.6, Feng Shui 2.0, Dragon 2.23.

Games and simple physical simulations have been used as the main benchmark domains for many fundamental developments. As the field matures, it is important to develop more sophisticated learning systems with the aim of solving more complex real-world tasks, but problems like catastrophic forgetting remain critical, and important capabilities such as skill composition through curriculum learning remain unsolved. Continual learning is an important challenge for reinforcement learning, because RL agents are trained sequentially, in interactive environments, and are especially vulnerable to the phenomena of catastrophic forgetting and catastrophic interference. Successful methods for continual learning have broad potential, because they could enable agents to learn multiple skills, potentially enabling complex behaviors. In particular, while deep learning has shown excellent progress towards training systems to perform with human or superhuman ability on various tasks (domains like vision, speech, and language as well as games such as Starcraft and Go), the resulting systems are still sluggish to respond to new information, or non-stationarities in the environment, compared to humans. Learning algorithms do exist that can quickly adapt to new data, but these are often at odds with large-scale deep learning systems. Meta-learning is one example of a learning paradigm that may not have this dilemma and thus holds promise as a framework for supporting fast and slow learning in a single learner. In this framework, one could view the learning process as having two levels of optimisation: an outer loop, which might adapt slowly towards a species level of optimisation, tailored for an environment, a morphology, and a family of skills or tasks; and an inner loop which allows an individual agent to more quickly adapt and diversify in response to a lifetime of experiences. I would argue that model-free deep reinforcement learning is an effective algorithm for optimising the outer loop of this process, but it may not be as successful as an algorithm for effective lifelong learning - the inner loop of the process.";[Hadsell, Raia] Google DeepMind, London, England;Hadsell, R (corresponding author), Google DeepMind, London, England.;;;;;;;0;0;0;1;1;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA;;;978-1-4503-6111-8;;;;2019;;;;;;;3;3;;10.1145/3321707.3326934;;;1;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Operations Research & Management Science";"Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science";BO7CJ;WOS:000523218400003;;;;;2020-12-16;

However, the success of DNNs depends on the proper configuration of its architecture and hyperparameters. Such a configuration is difficult and as a result, DNNs are often not used to their full potential. In addition, DNNs in commercial applications often need to satisfy real-world design constraints such as size or number of parameters. To make configuration easier, automatic machine learning (AutoML) systems for deep learning have been developed, focusing mostly on optimization of hyperparameters. This paper takes AutoML a step further. It introduces an evolutionary AutoML framework called LEAF that not only optimizes hyperparameters but also network architectures and the size of the network. LEAF makes use of both state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and distributed computing frameworks. Experimental results on medical image classification and natural language analysis show that the framework can be used to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In particular, LEAF demonstrates that architecture optimization provides a significant boost over hyperparameter optimization, and that networks can be minimized at the same time with little drop in performance. LEAF therefore forms a foundation for democratizing and improving AI, as well as making AI practical in future applications.;"[Liang, Jason; Meyerson, Elliot; Hodjat, Babak; Fink, Dan; Mutch, Karl; Miikkulainen, Risto] Univ Texas Austin, Cognizant Technol Solut, Austin, TX 78712 USA";Miikkulainen, R (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Cognizant Technol Solut, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;risto.miikkulainen@cognizant.com;;;;;;52;0;0;0;0;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA;;;978-1-4503-6111-8;;;;2019;;;;;;;401;409;;10.1145/3321707.3321721;;;9;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Operations Research & Management Science";"Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science";BO7CJ;WOS:000523218400049;;;;;2020-12-16;

We found the resulting representations are far simpler than existing approaches while providing comparable reconstructive performance.

Researchers in Russia and abroad are trying to give an exhaustive description of this concept, to determine the goals and objectives of entrepreneurs for the future in the given conditions. The digital economy is an independent part of the new economy, which is of great interest to economists and entrepreneurs. The reason is that it can be used to improve the management of various economic entities based on changes in the regulatory framework, increase the speed of management decisions, create innovative products and technologies, and develop new economic areas: economy of impressions, MICE industry, Smart city, etc. The use of digital technology has had positive results both globally and locally. On the one hand, the digital economy is a collection of new emerging industries. In recent years, the introduction of new innovative technologies has led to the emergence of huge markets for cellular communications, Internet services, the online gaming industry and others. On the other hand, innovative technologies have an impact on some areas of economic activity of existing economic entities with the aim of their transformation and improvement. This basically involves the replacement of methods, principles and mechanisms of work with the modern digital ones, or having digital elements in them, as well as their further modernization. Globalization is becoming a fundamental tendency and principle for the development of a modern economic system due to the increased integration of various spheres related to the formation of the global electronic network. The identified development trends provide broad opportunities for the development of global business, on the one hand, and on the other, increasing the responsibility of entrepreneurs, primarily to consumers. The essence of the digital economy, as well as the so-called new economy, is closely connected with revolutionary innovative changes in the application of digital technologies in all areas of activity, the creation and rapid development of the Internet, and innovations in both hardware and software. The current trends in the development of the world economy are largely due and will be determined by the development of the global electronic network, the use of information-intellectual and digital technologies, and the fuller realization of human capital and artificial intelligence potentials. Consequently, the study of the digital economy problems is highly relevant both from the point of view of the economy and from the standpoint of the practical transformation of management systems at various levels: from e-government to digital smart-management models of various objects.

Deep learning models, in particular, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), were developed and implemented successfully for various biomedical applications. Therefore, it is of paramount importance for healthcare practitioners to understand the mechanisms behind the implemented CNNs to accurately interpret their outcomes. This tutorial summarises the key steps to train a functional CNNs. CNNs are usually constructed in the order of a convolution operation, ReLU, spatial pooling and followed by the fully connected layers.

Although several methods to estimate nutrient intake have been developed, there is still a clear demand for a more reliable and fully automated technique, as this could improve the data accuracy and reduce both the participant burden and the health costs. In this paper, we propose a novel system based on artificial intelligence to accurately estimate nutrient intake, by simply processing RGB depth image pairs captured before and after a meal consumption. For the development and evaluation of the system, a dedicated and new database of images and recipes of 322 meals was assembled, coupled to data annotation using innovative strategies. With this database, a system was developed that employed a novel multi-task neural network and an algorithm for 3D surface construction. This allowed sequential semantic food segmentation and estimation of the volume of the consumed food, and permitted fully automatic estimation of nutrient intake for each food type with a 15% estimation error.;"[Lu, Ya; Stathopoulou, Thomai; Vasiloglou, Maria F.; Christodoulidis, Stergios; Mougiakakou, Stavroula G.] Univ Bern, ARTORG Ctr Biomed Engn Res, Murtenstr 50, CH-3008 Bern, Switzerland; [Blum, Beat; Walser, Thomas; Meier, Vinzenz] Univ Hosp Bern, Dept Catering & Cent Kitchen, Bern, Switzerland; [Stanga, Zeno] Univ Bern, Bern Univ Hosp, Inselspital, Dept Diabet Endocrinol Clin Nutr & Metab UDEM, CH-3010 Bern, Switzerland";Lu, Y (corresponding author), Univ Bern, ARTORG Ctr Biomed Engn Res, Murtenstr 50, CH-3008 Bern, Switzerland.;"ya.lu@artorg.unibe.ch; thomai.stathopoulou@artorg.unibe.ch; maria.vasiloglou@artorg.unibe.ch; stergios.christodoulidis@artorg.unibe.ch; beat.blum@insel.ch; thomas.walser@insel.ch; vinzenz.meier@insel.ch; Zeno.Stanga@insel.ch; stavroula.mougiakakou@artorg.unibe.ch";;Vasiloglou, Maria/0000-0002-2013-2858;SV Stiftung Foundation;Research supported by SV Stiftung Foundation.;;11;0;0;1;1;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;1557-170X;;978-1-5386-1311-5;IEEE ENG MED BIO;;;2019;;;;;;;5696;5699;;;;;4;"Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";Engineering;BP5OL;WOS:000557295306029;31947145;;;;2020-12-16;

Despite their potential in enabling personalized medicine applications, the adoption of Deep Learning based solutions in clinical workflows has been hindered in many cases by the strict regulations concerning the privacy of patient health data. We propose a solution that relies on Fully Homomorphic Encryption, particularly on the MORE scheme, as a mechanism for enabling computations on sensitive health data, without revealing the underlying data. The chosen variant of the encryption scheme allows for the computations in the Neural Network model to be directly performed on floating point numbers, while incurring a reasonably small computational overhead. For feasibility evaluation, we demonstrate on the MNIST digit recognition task that Deep Learning can be performed on encrypted data without compromising the accuracy. We then address a more complex task by training a model on encrypted data to estimate the outputs of a whole-body circulation (WBC) model. These results underline the potential of the proposed approach to outperform current solutions by delivering comparable results to the unencrypted Deep Learning based solutions, in a reasonable amount of time. Lastly, the security aspects of the encryption scheme are analyzed, and we show that, even though the chosen encryption scheme favors performance and utility at the cost of weaker security, it can still be used in certain practical applications.;"[Vizitiu, Anamaria; Nita, Cosmin Ioan; Puiu, Andrei; Suciu, Constantin; Itu, Lucian Mihai] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Dept Automat & Informat Technol, Brasov, Romania; [Vizitiu, Anamaria; Nita, Cosmin Ioan; Puiu, Andrei; Suciu, Constantin; Itu, Lucian Mihai] Siemens SRL, Corp Technol, Brasov, Romania";"Vizitiu, A (corresponding author), Transilvania Univ Brasov, Dept Automat & Informat Technol, Brasov, Romania.; Vizitiu, A (corresponding author), Siemens SRL, Corp Technol, Brasov, Romania.";;;;"European Union's Horizon 2020 Programme (H2020/2014-2020) [732907]; Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CCCDI - UEFISCDI within PNCDI III [ERANET-FLAG CONVERGENCE (2)]";"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Programme (H2020/2014-2020) under grant agreement no 732907.; This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CCCDI - UEFISCDI, project number ERANET-FLAG CONVERGENCE (2), within PNCDI III.";;19;1;1;2;2;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;1557-170X;;978-1-5386-1311-5;IEEE ENG MED BIO;;;2019;;;;;;;6498;6504;;;;;7;"Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";Engineering;BP5OL;WOS:000557295306212;31947330;Green Published;;;2020-12-16;

However, many obstetrical complications originate from abnormal focal or global placental development. Technical difficulties in assessing the placenta as well as a lack of established objective criteria to classify echotexture are barriers to diagnosis of pathology by ultrasound imaging. As a first step towards the development of a computer aided placental assessment tool, we developed a fully automated method for placental segmentation using a convolutional neural network. The network contains a novel layer weighted by automated acoustic shadow detection to recognize artifacts specific to ultrasound. In order to develop a detection algorithm usable in different imaging scenarios, we acquired a dataset containing 1364 fetal ultrasound images from 247 patients acquired over 47 months was taken with different machines, operators, and at a range of gestational ages. Mean Dice coefficients for automated segmentation on the full dataset with and without the acoustic shadow detection layer were 0.92 +/- 0.04 and 0.91 +/- 0.03 when comparing to manual segmentation. Mean Dice coefficients on the subset of images containing acoustic shadows with and without acoustic shadow detection were 0.87 +/- 0.04 and 0.75 +/- 0.05. The method requires no user input to tune the detection. The automated placenta segmentation method can serve as a preprocessing step for further image analysis in artificial intelligence methods requiring large scale data processing of placental images.;"[Hu, Ricky; Singla, Rohit; Rohling, Robert N.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Yan, Ryan; Mayer, Chantal] Univ British Columbia, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Rohling, Robert N.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Mech Engn, Vancouver, BC, Canada";Hu, R (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;rhu@ece.ubc.ca;;;Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaCGIAR;This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.;;20;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;1557-170X;1558-4615;978-1-5386-1311-5;IEEE ENG MED BIO;;;2019;;;;;;;6718;6723;;;;;6;"Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";Engineering;BP5OL;WOS:000557295307035;31947383;;;;2020-12-16;

While deeper and wider neural networks are designed for complex healthcare applications, model compression is poised to be an effective way to deploy networks on medical devices that often have hardware and speed constraints. Most state-of-the-art model compression techniques require a resource centric manual process that explores a large space to find a trade-off solution between model size and accuracy. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) approaches are proposed to automate such hand-crafted process. However, most RL model compression algorithms are model-free, meaning a very long time to train such RL agents due to the huge state space. In this work, we develop a hybridRL model compression (HMC) method that integrates model-based and model-free RL approaches. We demonstrate our method on a wide range of imaging data on healthcare related model architectures. Compared to model-free RL approaches, our results show that HMC method reduces the training time significantly, exhibits better generalization capabilities across different data sets, and preserves comparable model compression performance.;"[Soni, Ravi; Guan, Jiahui; Avinash, Gopal; Saripalli, V.

Condition monitoring of railway infrastructure has become more and more important that railway companies move to take advantage of artificial intelligence (Al) based technologies. Successful deployment of the technology will enable railway companies to conduct proper predictive maintenances before defects and failures take place so as to improve operation safety and efficiency. This paper presents an end-to-end time series classification approach for the detection of rail joints on railway track using acceleration data by training Convolutional Neural Networks. The advantages of this approach are: 1) working with raw data to reduce the heavy preprocessing of data; and 2) being able to detect joints on left or right rail using one model.

The amount of different types of information that have to be analyzed by physicians in the screening for pathologies and medical test prescription can be overwhelming and significantly increases the complexity of this problem. Two decision-tree-based approaches are proposed in this study for subject profiling and medical test rationing. The proposed models perform well in terms of prediction.

One of the steps for drug discovery is molecular docking. Molecular docking mimics the interaction between ligand and the target protein for in-vitro testing. Solving molecular docking problem isn't an easy task, because molecular docking involves many degrees of freedom. A lot of methods had been applied for this problem, one of them is artificial intelligence. This research will study the usage of bat algorithm in solving the molecular docking problem. Bat algorithm is an algorithm tha uses the characteristic of the bats in searching prey. The research will solve the molecular docking of alkaloid compound SA2014 towards cyclin D1 protein in cancer. Alkaloid compound SA2014 is isolated from marine sponge Cinachyrella anomala. The objective function for thi problem will be to minimize the binding energy, the lower energy means the bound of protein and ligand will be stronger. We use root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of protein structures to check the validation of bat algorithm. For validation, we used structure 3ptb and 2cpp. The validation shows that the bat algorithm is a valid method to solve the molecular docking problem because of the RMSD is not over 2A and the free binding energy is negative. For docking SA2014 towards cyclin D1, bat algorithm shows a negative value -2.217.;"[Fernando, Fedric; Irawan, Mohammad Isa] Inst Teknol Sepuluh Nopember, Dept Math, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Fadlan, Arif] Inst Teknol Sepuluh Nopember, Dept Chem, Surabaya, Indonesia";Fernando, F (corresponding author), Inst Teknol Sepuluh Nopember, Dept Math, Surabaya, Indonesia.;"fedricfernando43@gmail.com; mii@its.ac.id; afadlan@chem.its.ac.id";;;"Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember; Kementrian Riset, Teknologi, dan Pendidikan Tinggi Indonesia (Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of Republic Indonesia)";Thank you to Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, for giving scholarship to the corresponding author to study in Department of Mathematics, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember.

They are gaining new features and functionalities. We are finally starting to perceive production as a holonic system. Machines, robots and products are becoming intelligent and advanced information and communication technologies are becoming the central nervous systems of the future production. In the near future, artificial intelligence will take on many management and decision-making functions in production. Production systems will be able to learn from their past operations. Virtualization will bring massive deployment of sensors in production, allowing us to collect large amounts of data, generate information, process these and use them to create and apply new knowledge. The new production environment will maintain and operate its virtual image using the technologies of the Internet of Manufacturing and clouds. Without intelligent and adaptive production and logistics, companies will not be able to operate effectively in the competitive environment of global markets. The effort to speed up and streamline the design cycle of such intelligent production and logistics systems leads to the current trend of digitalization and virtual design of such systems. Attempts to improve the level of visualization, transparency, presentation of design outputs, as well as the effort to assess the feasibility of the proposed solution in a complex way and identify potential collisions in the proposed system while still at the designing stage, lead to the creation and utilization of 3D models of individual objects as well as complex production and logistic systems.

This is particularly true when dealing with very crowded environments, such as museums or fairs, where cognitive systems could be profitably used. The existing datasets in the wild are not sufficiently representative for this purposes, thus there is a growing need to make publicly available a more complex dataset for speaker recognition in extremely noisy conditions. In this paper, we propose the Speaker Recognition dataset in the Wild (SpReW), a novel and more challenging Italian audio database for speaker recognition tasks.

This work deals with the development of a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller to automate the drug infusion for the control of hypnosis in patients undergoing anesthesia. To do that, a combination of Neural Networks and optimization techniques were applied to tune the internal parameters of the fuzzy controller. For the training process, data from 20 patients undergoing surgery were used. Finally, the controller proposed was tested over 16 virtual surgeries.

The success caused by deep learning in recent years as a major upheaval in the field of artificial intelligence depends greatly on the data representation, since these representations can encode different types of hidden syntactic and semantic relationships in data, making their use very common in data science tasks. Ontologies do not escape this trend, applying deep learning techniques in the ontology-engineering field has heightened the need to learn and generate representations of the ontological data, which will allow ontologies to be exploited by such models and algorithms and thus automatizing different ontology-engineering tasks. This paper presents a novel approach for learning low dimensional continuous feature representations for ontology entities based on the semantic embedded in ontologies, using a multi-input feed-forward neural network trained using noise contrastive estimation technique. Semantically similar ontology entities will have relatively close corresponding representations in the projection space. Thus, the relationships between the ontology entities representations mirrors exactly the semantic relations between the corresponding entities in the source ontology.;"[Benarab, Achref; Sun, Jianguo; Guan, Jian] Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Refoufi, Allaoua] Univ Setif 1, Comp Sci Dept, Setif, Algeria";Benarab, A (corresponding author), Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Harbin, Peoples R China.;"achref.benarab@hrbeu.edu.cn; sunjianguo@hrbeu.edu.cn; allaoua.refoufi@univ-setif.dz; j.guan@hrbeu.edu.cn";;;International Exchange Program of Harbin Engineering University for Innovation-oriented Talented Cultivation;This paper is funded by the International Exchange Program of Harbin Engineering University for Innovation-oriented Talented Cultivation.;;25;0;0;0;0;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;1865-0929;1865-0937;"978-3-030-21451-7; 978-3-030-21450-0";COMM COM INF SC;;;2019;1027;;;;;;51;62;;10.1007/978-3-030-21451-7_5;;;12;"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Operations Research & Management Science";"Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science";BP5RT;WOS:000558101000005;;;;;2020-12-16;

However, it seems that many companies struggle in finding the right tools and use cases for their distinct fields of application. Thus, the aim of the presented study was to evaluate the current state of machine learning and co in various European companies. Talking to 19 employees from various different industry sectors, we explored applicability of AI tools as well as human attitudes towards these technologies. Results show that AI implementations are still in their early stages, with a rather small number of viable use cases. Tools are predominantly bespoke and internally built, while off-the-shelf solutions suffer from a lack of trust in third party service providers. Although companies claim to have no intention of reducing the workforce in favor of AI technology, employees fear job loss and thus often reject adoption. Another important challenge concerns data privacy and ethics, which has grown in relevance with respect to recent changes in European legislation. In summary, we found that companies recognize the competitive advantage AI may attribute to their value chains, in particular when it comes to automation and increased process efficiency. Yet they are also aware of the rather social challenges, which currently inhibit the proliferation of AI-driven solutions.;"[Schloegl, Stephan; Postulka, Claudia; Bernsteiner, Reinhard; Ploder, Christian] MCI Management Ctr Innsbruck, Dept Management Commun & IT, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria";Schlogl, S (corresponding author), MCI Management Ctr Innsbruck, Dept Management Commun & IT, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.;stephan.schloegl@mci.edu;;"Schlogl, Stephan/0000-0001-7469-4381; Ploder, Christian/0000-0002-7064-8465";;;;60;0;0;3;3;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;1865-0929;1865-0937;"978-3-030-21451-7; 978-3-030-21450-0";COMM COM INF SC;;;2019;1027;;;;;;259;270;;10.1007/978-3-030-21451-7_22;;;12;"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Operations Research & Management Science";"Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science";BP5RT;WOS:000558101000022;;;;;2020-12-16;

There were realised three studies attended by students from engineering specialties, young engineering specialists and their employers. Research results highlight the key role of knowledge and skills that young professionals must possess to achieve technical performance, scientific and economic information in accordance with international standards. With an accelerated technological progress, it is clear that we are on the top of a new era of machine learning, machine doing and finally, of a true artificial intelligence (AI). It is a central point in history that presents both opportunities and challenges. And undoubtedly, the most significant social and economic impact will be on the job - it is required to determine what work will be performed and by whom. In this aspect, application of exponential technologies is analysed in order to strengthen labor and accelerate business growth, as we enter the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In this new era, the transition to innovations based on combinations of technologies, force companies to reconsider how they do business, including requirements put forward in preparing new specialists in the labor market.

This approach is demanded and necessary within technical equipment design stages, and is an integrant part of systems integrity design methodology. Designing the system integrity includes design criteria for reliability, availability, maintainability and safety of any system and equipment. The combination of these four concepts leads to the necessity of a comparative and integrative methodology that should ensure a good systems design, with required integrity values that can be computed easily, analyzed the most complete possible, and with the possibility to be modified accordingly. During the recent years, artificial intelligence techniques have been developed for dependability, that make use of: statistic methods (necessary for the realization of an operation history), deterministic mathematic algorithms (to determine the exact solutions when these can be determined and are required and the time resource is not critical), heuristic artificial intelligence methods (that can provide good quality solutions when time is a critical resource) - neuronal networks, genetic algorithms (to determine predicted or extreme values for system variables), as well as fuzzy methods for systems in which the system variables change within certain values intervals. All these techniques offer a global image of the artificial intelligence modelling (AIM) in designing the reliability, availability, maintainability and safety, in order to offer a continuous design feedback mean during the entire engineering design process. In this work, we shall develop a fuzzy model for a technical process and will compare our results with the results supplied by mathematical, neuronal and genetic models applied to the same system. The qualitative comparison of models will be completed with their quantitative comparison, by analyzing the complexity of algorithms and execution time. The utility of this work consists in the implementation of an inter-disciplinary tool easy to apply to technical systems with measurable dependability variables that can provide during the flow sheet, the values requested from technical and economic standpoint.;"[Vilcu, A.; Verzea, I.; Pislaruand, M.; Herghiligiu, I.] Gheorghe Asachi Tech Univ Iasi, Dept Engn & Management, D Mangeron 63, Iasi, Romania";Vilcu, A (corresponding author), Gheorghe Asachi Tech Univ Iasi, Dept Engn & Management, D Mangeron 63, Iasi, Romania.;avilcu@tuiasi.ro;;"HERGHILIGIU, IONUT VIOREL/0000-0003-4759-7839; Pislaru, Marius/0000-0003-3695-3463";National Research Grants of the Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania [GnaC2018_119];This work was supported by a National Research Grants of the Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania, project number GnaC2018_119.;;26;0;0;0;0;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;1757-8981;;;IOP CONF SER-MAT SCI;;;2019;591;;;;;;;;12072;10.1088/1757-899X/591/1/012072;;;10;"Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary";"Engineering; Materials Science";BP7TF;WOS:000562929900072;;Bronze;;;2020-12-16;

Some are related to common procedures, such as searching in files and text editors, or, more recently, to more advanced problems such as pattern detection in Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics. Tens of algorithms and methodologies have been developed for pattern matching and several programming languages, packages, applications and online systems exist that can perform exact string matching in biological sequences. These techniques, however, are limited to searching for specific and predefined strings in a sequence. In this paper a novel methodology (called Ex2SM) is presented, which is a pipeline of execution of advanced data structures and algorithms, explicitly designed for text mining, that can detect every possible repeated string in multivariate biological sequences. In contrast to known algorithms in literature, the methodology presented here is string agnostic, i.e., it does not require an input string to search for it, rather it can detect every string that exists at least twice, regardless of its attributes such as length, frequency, alphabet, overlapping etc. The complexity of the problem solved and the potential of the proposed methodology is demonstrated with the experimental analysis performed on the entire human genome. More specifically, all repeated strings with a length of up to 50 characters have been detected, an achievement which is practically impossible using other algorithms due to the exponential number of possible arrangements Sigma(50)(n=1)4(n) of such long strings.;[Xylogiannopoulos, Konstantinos F.] Univ Calgary, Dept Comp Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada;Xylogiannopoulos, KF (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Comp Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada.;kostasfx@yahoo.gr;;;;;;28;0;0;0;0;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA;;;978-1-4503-6868-1;;;;2019;;;;;;;801;808;;10.1145/3341161.3343517;;;8;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Telecommunications";BP5IK;WOS:000555683800138;;;;;2020-12-16;

The FusaHum graminearum Sehw., special fugus always damages the wheat ear, and produces vomitoxin,is difficult to control and prevent, and seriously threatens the health of humans, animals and China's food security. Currently, rapidly, accurately and non-destructively diagnostic devices or systems for this disease have not been disclosed. In this study, the infected ears with different severities were picked up in key growth stages. The diseased area of wheat ear was extracted using hypergreen characteristic, and a total of 30 features of infected ears were chosen including color (Lab, HSI, HSV, YCbCr color space), texture (LBP and LLE dimension reduction), and shape (squareness, shape complexity, and eccentricity). Then using the competitive adaptive re-weighted sampling (CARS) and rough set algorithm (RS) to screen the characteristics of the diseased ear, the four characteristics with the largest contribution were determined to establish the CARS-SVM and CARS-RS-SVM models respectively. The study found that the recognition rate of CARS-SVM model is 85.4%, while CARS-RS-SVM model is 92.7%. Thus the CARS-RS-SVM was thought of as the optimal model by two indicators of identification accuracy. On the basis, a wheat scab diagnosis system based on Android mobile phone was constructed. It consists of three parts - Clients, Service-Terminal and Database. The Client was designed by Android Studio and its functions mainly include image acquisition, image storage, GPS positioning, image uploading and diagnostic results display. The Service-Terminal was completed by the mixed programming of Myeclipse and Matlab software, and Tomcat was used as the Server. It mainly implements the functions of image receiving, image preprocessing, feature extraction and selection, and classifier modeling. The MySQL was used to establish two databases: the Disease Characteristics Database and the Disease Diagnosis Knowledge Base. Finally, through samples testing and validating, the Android-based mobile terminal can real-time collect the image of Fusarium head blight and upload the server. After the target image was processed and compared by the Disease Characteristics Database, the appropriate diagnostic knowledge was selected from the Disease Diagnosis Knowledge Base and feedbacked to the client. In summary, the results of this study showed that it was helpful for the rapid and non-destructive investigation of infected FHB in the field, and it would provide a reference for the study of other crop diseases, facilitate the application and development of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data in agriculture.;"[Zhang, Dongyan; Wang, Daoyong; Huang, Linsheng; Zhao, Haitao; Liang, Dong] Anhui Univ, Anhui Engn Lab Agroecol Big Data, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Du, Shizhou] Anhui Acad Agr Sci, Inst Crops, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Gu, Chunyan; Yang, Xue] Anhui Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect & Agroprod Safety, Hefei, Peoples R China";Zhang, DY (corresponding author), Anhui Univ, Anhui Engn Lab Agroecol Big Data, Hefei, Peoples R China.;"zhangdy@ahu.edu.cn; P17301169@stu.ahu.edu.cn; dsz315@sina.com; linsheng0808@163.com; 1095641104@qq.com; dliang@ahu.edu.cn; guchunyan0408@163.com; yangxue2121@163.com";;;"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41771463, 41771469]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0200608, 2016YFD0300700]; Anhui Provincial Science and Technology Major Project [16030701091]";This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41771463, 41771469), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFD0200608, 2016YFD0300700) and the Anhui Provincial Science and Technology Major Project(Grant No.16030701091).;;15;0;0;1;1;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2334-3168;;978-1-7281-2116-1;INT CONF AGRO-GEOINF;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;5;"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications";"Agriculture; Computer Science";BP7JF;WOS:000562356600092;;;;;2020-12-16;

Data-driven and artificial intelligence approaches have been used to facilitate finding relationships between alloy composition, and manufacturing processing conditions with mechanical properties of materials. Machine learning (ML) methods are a promising route to predict FLD of aluminium alloys that are increasingly used in automotive structural applications. In the present work, we developed a machine learning (ML) based tool to establish the relationships between alloy composition / thermomechanical processing route to the material's FLD, which is a measure of formability. Measured FLDs of various 5XXX and 6XXX aluminium alloys along with their chemical composition and thermomechanical processing parameters like homogenization, hot and cold rolling parameters etc. and the respective mechanical properties like n and r values were manually curated and stored in a database. A two-stage ML model was trained on this database. In the first stage, the minimum and maximum points of the minor strain were predicted using a feature set incorporating chemical composition, thermomechanical processing parameters, and n and r values using support vector regression (SVR). In the second stage, the predicted minor strain in the first stage was used as input in addition to the same feature set to predict the major strain using gradient boost regression (GBR). The trained ML model successfully predicted FLDs with R-2 value above 0.93. To study the impact of the difference between a predicted and a measured FLD on stamping simulation results, finite element simulations of a cross die were performed. The difference in draw depth of the cross-die using the predicted FLD and the measured FLD was between 5 to 10%. The current results show that ML can be a viable way for predicting FLDs.;"[Chheda, Amar M.; Nazro, Louis; Sen, Fatih G.; Hegadekatte, Vishwanath] Novelis Global Res & Technol Ctr, 1950 Vaughn Rd, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA";Sen, FG (corresponding author), Novelis Global Res & Technol Ctr, 1950 Vaughn Rd, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA.;"fatih.sen@novelis.adityabirla.com; vishwanath.hegadekatte@novelis.adityabirla.com";;;;;;22;0;0;0;0;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;1757-8981;;;IOP CONF SER-MAT SCI;;;2019;651;;;;;;;;12107;10.1088/1757-899X/651/1/012107;;;8;"Engineering, Mechanical; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing";"Engineering; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Materials Science";BP7IC;WOS:000562096600106;;Bronze;;;2020-12-16;

This upgrade can be performed only with the use of conceptual and methodological apparatus of dialectics. Its consistent application to objects, in either case connected with ideas about the intellect, results in the formulation of the dialectic symmetry principle. The first practical steps for the implementation of the proposed concept in practice are associated with the creation of a new education paradigm, which operates, including ideas that education being understood as a public institution, is not reducible to individual learning.

One of the important tasks in building design is to provide a reliable system for the evacuation of the users in emergency situations. Therefore, one of the motivations of this research is to provide a framework for architects and engineers to better design buildings at the conceptual design stage, regarding the necessary provisions in emergency situations.

The experiments provide a proof-of-concept of the effectiveness of integrating RL, graphs, and non-manifold topology within a visual data flow programming environment.

However creative interaction brings unexpected changes, obstacles, complexities and non-linearities which are encountered in real time and cannot be predicted in advance. This paper presents an experimental methodology for robotic path planning using Machine Learning. The focus of this methodology is obstacle avoidance. A neural network is deployed, providing a relationship between the robot's pose and its surroundings, thus allowing for motion planning and obstacle avoidance, directly integrated within the design environment. The method is demonstrated through a series of case-studies. The method combines haptic teaching with machine learning to create a task specific dataset, giving the robot the ability to adapt to obstacles without being explicitly programmed at every instruction. This opens the door to shifting to robotic applications for construction in unstructured environments, where adapting to the singularities of the workspace, its occupants and activities presents an important computational hurdle today.;"[Rossi, Gabriella] Odico, Odense, Denmark; [Nicholas, Paul] CITA KADK, Copenhagen, Denmark";Rossi, G (corresponding author), Odico, Odense, Denmark.;"gr@gabriellarossi.tech; paul.nicholas@kadk.dk";;;;;;18;3;3;1;1;ECAADE-EDUCATION & RESEARCH COMPUTER AIDED ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN EUROPE;BRUSSELS;DEPT ARCHITECTURE SINT-LUCAS BRUSSELS-GHENT, HOGESCHOOL VOOR WETENSCHAP & KUNST, PALEIZENSTRAAT 65, BRUSSELS, 1030, BELGIUM;;;978-94-91207-18-1;;;;2019;;;;;;;201;210;;;;;10;"Architecture; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Education, Scientific Disciplines";"Architecture; Computer Science; Education & Educational Research";BP7TK;WOS:000562937300023;;;;;2020-12-16;

Much work in this area focuses on image classification, where the required explanations can be given in terms of images, therefore making explanations relatively easy to communicate to end-users. For a classification problem, a contrastive explanation tries to understand why the classifier has not answered a particular class, say B, instead of the returned class A. Sparse dictionaries have been recently used to identify local image properties as main ingredients for a system producing humanly understandable explanations for the decisions of a classifier developed based on machine learning methods.

FMEA utilizes the risk priority number (RPN) to determine the risk priority order of failure modes. RPN is calculated by multiplying the values of three risk factors: severity (S), detection (D) and occurrence (O) Although FMEA techniques are used in different industries in many situations when multiple experts give their opinions about one failure mode, the risk evaluations can be vague and imprecise, which could arise conflicting evidence that is hard to manage. This paper presents a risk-cost analysis model that uses Genetic algorithms to generate an FMEA for the raw materials and finished parts reception process, in automotive industry. Unlike the classic FMEA analysis, in our model the risk factors D and O are determined by resources cost analysis involved in their improvement. Here comes the Genetic algorithm that will determine the optimal cost under an acceptable risk. The proposed solution uses modern information technology for data acquisition (complex event processing), automation of analysis process (artificial intelligence) and long-term support for quality staff in FMEA analysis (real time and batch data analytics).;"[Belu, N.; Rachieru, N.] Univ Pitesti, Mfg & Ind Management Dept, Targul Din Vale St 1, Pitesti, Romania; [Ionescu, L.

Many new plants are contracted constantly. Strategic planning and many other technical decisions are significant to these strategic systems. The proposed Artificial Intelligent (AI) methods provide decision makers with different choices for investment, where each is comprised of different desalination combinations regarding to locations, capacities, and energy sources in terms of several performance metrics. The intelligent decisions determine the optimal stations location and the water desalination system capacity for future expectations. Other smart decisions select the optimal desalination technologies for available existing and suggested desalination planting. In addition, AI methods provide decision makers to configure the pipeline network and transport water among the planting locations. The proposed work is a method to upkeep strategic decision making for the best water desalination facility. Our methodology offers a set of AI alternatives for several desalination plans. Decision support systems and tools are imperfect to deliver a set of alternatives. Therefore, the proposed work provides a systematic decision process to validate several water desalination alternatives, considering intelligent water pumping to the locations through the pumping network and water storage at every location. The proposed approach is validated for a case study in Jordan, which is a beginner country in desalination. The results show where economic and environmental benefits occurs.

Development; We developed a cloud building energy and environment monitoring system (cloud Building Management System (BEMS)) and an optimized control system (an artificial intelligence [AI] control system). Methodology; First, we designed an inefficiency analysis model and the analysis steps. Next, this model was tested in several actual buildings, and the method was confirmed to be adaptable. Finally, through iterative adaptations based on the results, we significantly improved our method. Findings; (1) The developed cloud BEMS and AI control system were confirmed to be useful for a) improvement of building management, b) improvement of equipment and system, and c) renovation. (2) Our analytical method and its steps can quantify inefficiency. (3) When using this methodology, we can quantitatively predict before implementation the effect of a) building improvement, b) equipment and system improvement, and c) renovation. Originality/value; Cloud BEMS collects time series data related to building energy consumption from sensors and building automation systems and accumulates data in a cloud server. The AI control system and analytical method finds energy inefficiencies and improves the operation of the building. Moreover, this improvement in operation is unmanned and carried out automatically.

One of the famous batik producing regions in Indonesia is Pekalongan City, Central Java. Pekalongan Batik has a distinctive characteristic compared to other regions, namely from the aspect of color and motif. Pekalongan batik uses bright colors and flora motifs. However, there are some batik craftsmen who still use dark colors. Identify Pekalongan's typical batik motifs become an obstacle for tourists that are visiting Indonesia. There needs to be an automatic identification system to recognize Pekalongan Batik motifs. The automatic identification system of batik images can contribute to the development of technology in the field of artificial intelligence. This research was conducted by collecting image data taken through observation, interviews and literature review. The image data obtained are four batik motifs. 5 images will be taken from each motif and will be implemented into the system using Matlab R2014a. The next process is feature extraction using the Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method to get information in the batik image. The author then identifies image using the Backpropagation method to obtain the epoch value, learning rate, and accuracy value based on the identification process. The tested system obtained the highest accuracy of 91.2% with epoch 100 and learning rate 0.03 on Sogan batik, 89.6% accuracy with epoch 100 and learning rate 0.02 on Jlamprang batik. 87.2% accuracy was obtained from Cap Kombinasi batik and Tiga Negeri batik with epoch 100, the learning rate was 0.01 and 0.04 respectively.

However, many automation systems rely on severely outdated technology that render it challenging, if not impossible, to implement recently developed, advanced building control approaches. By contrast, recent developments in cloud computing and wireless technology could support solutions to these challenges. However, many stakeholders require a suitable methodology to determine the potentials and the requirements of future, possibly next generation BAS. In this paper, we thus present and apply a method to answer the open questions and define minimum requirements. For that end, we investigate available communication technologies, protocols, and interfaces. Moreover, we present a simple test bench layout that could serve as a blueprint for future, more comprehensive test benches. It is a model a ventilation circuit consisting of a CO2 sensor for the supply air and an electronic damper. We turned these conventional components with analogue interfaces into IoT devices using a previously developed WiFi gateway. An exemplary test is the control of the CO2 concentration using a feedback controller implemented on an external machine. We aim to extend our initial prototype to a real-life building demonstration for dynamically scalable automation systems using wireless communication and develop our set-up into a platform enabling arbitrarily complex automation strategies and artificial intelligence applications.;"[Bode, Gerrit; Baranski, Marc; Schraven, Markus; Kuempel, Alexander; Storek, Thomas; Nuerenberg, Markus; Mueller, Dirk] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, E ON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52072 Aachen, Germany; [Rothe, Andreas; Ziegeldorf, Jan Henrik; Fuetterer, Johannes] Aedif GmbH, Hohenzollernring 72, D-50672 Cologne, Germany; [Rothe, Andreas; Ziegeldorf, Jan Henrik; Fuetterer, Johannes] AutomationOne GmbH, Wildsteig, Germany; [Scheuffele, Bernd] Wiesweg 32, D-82409 Wildsteig, Germany";Bode, G (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, E ON Energy Res Ctr, Inst Energy Efficient Bldg & Indoor Climate, Mathieustr 10, D-52072 Aachen, Germany.;gbode@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de;;;BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy) [03ET1657A];We gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the BMWi (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy), promotional reference 03ET1657A.;;16;1;1;0;0;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;1742-6588;1742-6596;;J PHYS CONF SER;;;2019;1343;;;;;;;;12059;10.1088/1742-6596/1343/1/012059;;;6;"Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels";"Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels";BP7FB;WOS:000561852800059;;Bronze;;;2020-12-16;

One of the main bottlenecks of this technique is the quadratic growth of the kNN graph size due to the high-quantity of new connections between nodes in the graph, resulting in long computation times. Several strategies have been proposed to address this, but none are effective and efficient. Our novel technique, based on LSH projections, obtains the same performance as the exact kNN graph after diffusion, but in less time (approximately 18 times faster on a dataset of a hundred thousand images).

Brick segmentation is an important initial step in the documentation and analysis of masonry wall images. However, due to the heterogeneous material, size, shape and arrangement of the bricks, it is highly challenging to develop a widely adoptable solution for the problem via conventional geometric and radiometry based approaches. In this paper, we propose a new technique which combines the strength of deep learning for brick seed localization, and the Watershed algorithm for accurate instance segmentation. More specifically, we adopt a U-Net-based delineation algorithm for robust marker generation in the Watershed process, which provides as output the accurate contours of the individual bricks, and also separates them from the mortar regions. For training the network and evaluating our results, we created a new test dataset which consist of 162 hand-labeled images of various wall categories. Quantitative evaluation is provided both at instance and at pixel level, and the results are compared to two reference methods proposed for wall delineation, and to a morphology based brick segmentation approach. The experimental results showed the advantages of the proposed U-Net markered Watershed method, providing average F1-scores above 80%.;"[Ibrahim, Yahya; Nagy, Balazs; Benedek, Csaba] Pazmany Peter Catholic Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Bion, 3In Res Grp, Esztergom, Hungary; [Nagy, Balazs; Benedek, Csaba] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Comp Sci & Control, Budapest, Hungary";Ibrahim, Y (corresponding author), Pazmany Peter Catholic Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Bion, 3In Res Grp, Esztergom, Hungary.;"ibrahim.yahya@itk.ppke.hu; nagy.balazs@sztaki.mta.hu; benedek.csaba@sztaki.mta.hu";;Ibrahim, Yahya/0000-0003-0131-985X;"National Research, Development and Innovation Fund, Budapest, Hungary [NKFIA K-120233, KH-125681]; Szechenyi 2020 Program, Budapest, Hungary [EFOP-3.6.2-16-2017-00013, 3.6.3-VEKOP-162017-00002]";This work was supported by the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund (grants NKFIA K-120233 and KH-125681), and by the Szechenyi 2020 Program (grants EFOP-3.6.2-16-2017-00013 and 3.6.3-VEKOP-162017-00002).

Having all the emerging technological trends and visions in mind (e.g., artificial intelligence or the IoT platform), the complexity will achieve an entirely new dimension within our knowledge-based society. In order to be successful in future, engineers or actually young aspirants need to change their learning behaviour to overcome these new issues in complexity management. Hence, cooperative and application-oriented learning including an exchange of knowledge and experience is increasingly gaining in importance, especially in view of the abstract and holistic thinking within the field of systems engineering. Dealing with this future complexity and difficulty, this contribution presents an innovative manner of transferring knowledge in a considerably practice-oriented way within the largely theory-based subject of systems design methodology for first semester bachelor students. In doing so, the pursued systematic product development procedure deals with the prospectively more important aspects of an integrated view on product design, material and technology selection as well as soft skills issues such as showing individual initiative, innovative spirit and time management, apart from social competences (e.g., appropriate teamwork skills as well as a strong ability to communicate and critical faculty).;"[Kaspar, Jerome; Vielhaber, Michael] Saarland Univ, Inst Engn Design, Saarbrucken, Germany";Kaspar, J (corresponding author), Saarland Univ, Inst Engn Design, Saarbrucken, Germany.;;;;;;;5;0;0;0;0;DESIGN SOC;GLASGOW;109 DUNDEE DRIVE, GLASGOW, G52 3HL, SCOTLAND;;;978-1-912254-05-7;E&PDE;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;6;"Education, Scientific Disciplines; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing";"Education & Educational Research; Engineering";BP7EZ;WOS:000561837600001;;;;;2020-12-16;

We are nowadays confronted with buzz words as: PropTech, Blockchains, artificial intelligence, machine augmented intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, deep learning, internet of things, Big Data etc. The change is holistic, and therefore we are more and more talking about digital ecosystem. Built heritage preservation is only a narrow discipline within cultural industries, however, its impact on our urban living is huge and therefore it is worthy of further consideration how our urban living and heritage preservation change in that new digital ecosystem. The flows of development of our urban areas, cities, metropolitan areas, regions and megacities are expecting to change and that implies game change for planning, governance and management on all levels. It is well known that global demographic growth increases land-efficiency demands, which further endangers our built heritage, but we need also to explore how heritage preservation may benefit in new environment despite all probabilities. Therefore, we analyze how built heritage preservation benefits from scientific methods enabled by new technologies, which inter alia, may accurately measure and therefore provide scientific evidence of unique and irreplaceable impact that our heritage has for society. We discuss how interaction between built heritage and new technologies reveal values for society, which we nowadays (un)intentionally associate with heritage preservation, revealing genuine legacy of our generation and ways to prevent contamination of our urban culture.;[Zivaljevic-Luxor, Natasa] Natl Heritage Fdn, Belgrade, Serbia;Zivaljevic-Luxor, N (corresponding author), Natl Heritage Fdn, Belgrade, Serbia.;luxornatasa@qmail.com;;;;;;25;0;0;0;0;GANGEMI EDITORE S P A;ROMA;PIAZZA SAN PANTALEO 4, ROMA, 00186, ITALY;2611-8998;;978-88-492-3752-8;ARCHIT HERIT DES;;;2019;4;;;;;;897;907;;;;;11;Architecture;Architecture;BP7AK;WOS:000561109000098;;;;;2020-12-16;

Mainly, IC participates rigorously for the development of society in a variety of application areas such as finance, marketing, health, industrial automation, education, and safety and security. Typically, an IC model takes image input data and tunes itself as per the required application task and classify accordingly. Among the various categories of images, color image category is better due to the capability of capturing more details, which are essential for classification purpose. However, the modern world demands Realtime or online image classification, which involves Imagery Streams. The highly likely uncertainty in Imagery Streams is due to non-stationary environment, for example, certain features or class boundaries which are valid at one-time step are not adequate for another time step. These uncertainties in Imagery Streams have deleterious effects on IC models, which causes performance degradation in terms of accuracy or make IC models, not in further use. Therefore, to overcome these issues, IC models need to adapt to changes caused by uncertainties in Imagery Streams. This paper focuses on the understanding the possible scenarios of such uncertainties in Color Imagery Streams, investigates the deleterious effects due to changes in Color Imagery Streams and provides the possible mitigation approach to overcome the issues in IC models. The contribution of this research is the first step towards an adaptive model development to mitigate the deleterious effects of uncertainty in Color Imagery Streams.

However, due to fluctuating annual production of Indonesian palm oil, the government is confused in determining palm oil import or export policies. Therefore, a good method is needed to predict Indonesian palm oil production. Soft computing can be used for classification and prediction. Soft computing is a model approach to compute by mimicking the ability of extraordinary human reason to reason and learn in environments that have uncertainty and inaccuracy. Some techniques in soft computing include fuzzy systems, artificial neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and probabilistic reasoning. One method in Artificial Neural Network is Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). RNN is that the network contains at least one feed-back connection, so the activations can flow round in a loop. In the last few years, the RNN network model has been developed, namely by using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer. By using the LSTM layer, the RNN learning process gets better. Therefore, in this study the prediction of palm oil production using the LSTM-RNN method is based on the time series data from 1970 to 2017. The results of this study are found that the LSTM-RNN method is very well used for predictions because it produces MAPE of 2.7098% for training data and 2.9861% for testing data compared to other prediction methods.;"[Sugiyarto, Aditya Wisnugraha; Abadi, Agus Maman] Univ Negeri Yogyakarta, Math Dept, Yogyakarta, Indonesia";Sugiyarto, AW (corresponding author), Univ Negeri Yogyakarta, Math Dept, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.;"adityawisnugraha@gmail.com; agusmaman@uny.ac.id";;;;;;20;0;0;0;1;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-3041-5;;;;2019;;;;;;;53;57;;;;;5;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP7EJ;WOS:000561709200011;;;;;2020-12-16;

However for Malay manuscripts (MM) written in old jawi, its exposure on such field is limited. Besides, most of the studies related to MM studies and NLP were focused on rule based or rule based machine transliteration (RBMT). Hence the objective of this study is to propose a statistical approach for old jawi to modern jawi transliteration of Malay manuscript contents using Phrase Based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) as its model. In order to achieve such purpose, quality score of Word Error Rate (WER) was computed on the transliteration output. Besides, the issues formerly encountered by rule based approach such as vocals limitation and homograph, reduplication, letters error and combination of multiple words were observed in the implementation. Moreover, this paper utilized exploratory approach as its research strategy and mixed method as its research method. The data for the analysis were extracted from a MM titled Bidayat al-Mubtadi bi-Fadlillah al-Muhdi. Quality score of WER was computed for the evaluation of SMT output. Afterwards, related issues were identified and assessed. The research found that quality score of PBSMT for old jawi to modern jawi transliteration was high in terms of WER, however the issues of rule based were generally addressed by PBSMT except homograph. The research is however limited to the approach of SMT that solely focused on PBSMT as its model. Moreover, the corpus size was limited to one manuscript while SMT relies on corpus size. Nevertheless the research contributes to the wider coverage on Malay language as one of the under resource languages in NLP, in form of old and modern jawi. Besides, to the best of the researcher's knowledge, it is also the first to apply SMT (PBSMT) approach on old jawi transliteration. Most importantly, the study is to contribute on MM's studies.;"[Razak, Sitti Munirah Abdul; Abu Seman, Muhamad Sadry; Ali, Wan; Mamat, Wan Yusoff Wan; Nizan, Noor Hasrul; Noor, Mohammad] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Informat Syst, Kulliyyah Informat & Commun Technol, Gombak 53100, Selangor, Malaysia";Razak, SMA (corresponding author), Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Dept Informat Syst, Kulliyyah Informat & Commun Technol, Gombak 53100, Selangor, Malaysia.;sittimunirahabdulrazak@gmail.com;;;;;;18;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-3041-5;;;;2019;;;;;;;137;141;;;;;5;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP7EJ;WOS:000561709200026;;;;;2020-12-16;

Different network architectures are proposed for training agents to navigate and find targeted objects in both real and simulated environments. Despite promising results, one key challenge remaining is that the agent has to perform well in unseen environments and objects. To solve this generalization problem, this work proposes a method using prior knowledge graph capturing relationships between target objects.

This study aims to use machine learning to distinguish between the speech of patients who suffer from mental disorders which cause psychosis from that of healthy individuals to improve early detection of schizophrenia. We analyzed forty interview transcripts from patients who have been diagnosed with first episode psychosis.

The preliminary test results achieved a prediction rate of 99%, which indicated that our speech classifier was able to discriminate speech in patients from healthy individuals' daily conversations. This suggested that machine learning models can learn and train upon features of natural languages to predict whether or not an individual is beginning to show the first signs of early psychosis based on their speech.

We focus on personnel rostering and scheduling problems in which there are often past schedules available and show that it is possible to automatically learn constraints from such examples. To realize this, we adapted some techniques from the constraint programming community and extended them in order to cope with multidimensional examples. The method uses a tensor representation of the example, which helps in capturing the dimensionality as well as the structure of the example, and applies tensor operations to find the constraints that are satisfied by the example. The algorithm also identifies inherent clusters in the data and uses it as background knowledge to learn more detailed constraints. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we used constraints from the Nurse Rostering Competition and generated solutions that satisfy these constraints; these solutions were then used as examples to learn constraints.

This technique is therefore relevant for the near-optimal control of nonlinear switched systems, for which the switching signal is the control. However, OP exhibits several limitations, which prevent its application in a standard control context. First, it requires the stage cost to take values in [0,1], an unnatural prerequisite as it excludes, for instance, quadratic stage costs. Second, it requires the cost function to be discounted. Third, it applies for reward maximization, and not cost minimization. In this paper, we modify OP to overcome these limitations, and we call the new algorithm OPmin. We then make stabilizability and detectability assumptions, under which we derive near-optimality guarantees for OPmin and we show that the obtained bound has major advantages compared to the bound originally given by OP. In addition, we prove that a system whose inputs are generated by OPmin in a receding-horizon fashion exhibits stability properties. As a result, OPmin provides a new tool for the near-optimal, stable control of nonlinear switched discrete-time systems for generic cost functions.;"[Granzotto, Mathieu; Postoyan, Romain; Daafouz, Jamal] Univ Lorraine, CNRS, CRAN, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Busoniu, Lucian] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Dept Automat, Memorandumului 28, Cluj Napoca 400114, Romania; [Nesic, Dragan] Univ Melbourne, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia";Granzotto, M (corresponding author), Univ Lorraine, CNRS, CRAN, F-54000 Nancy, France.;"mathieu.granzotto@univ-lorraine.fr; romain.postoyan@univ-lorraine.fr; lucian.busoniu@aut.utcluj.ro; dnesic@unimelb.edu.au; jamal.daafouz@univ-lorraine.fr";;Busoniu, Lucian/0000-0001-8017-1296;"Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, within PNCDI III [PN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2016-0670, TE 9/2018]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP170104099]";"Lucian Busoniu is with the Department of Automation, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Memorandumului 28, 400114 Cluj-Napoca, Romania (email:lucian.busoniu@aut.utcluj.ro).His work was supported by a grant of the Romanian Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P1-1.1-TE-2016-0670, contract TE 9/2018, within PNCDI III.; Dragan Nesic is with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia (e-mail: dnesic@unimelb.edu.au).His work was supported by the Australian Research Council under the Discovery Project DP170104099.";;22;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;0743-1546;;978-1-7281-1398-2;IEEE DECIS CONTR P;;;2019;;;;;;;3405;3410;;;;;6;"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering";BP6UW;WOS:000560779003019;;;;;2020-12-16;

This paper presents a problem called 'semantic inference', the goal of which is to automatically translate the behavior of a CPS to a formal specification written in signal temporal logic (STL). To reduce the potential combinatorial explosion inherent to the problem, this paper adopts a search strategy called agenda-based computation, which is inspired by natural language processing. Based on such a strategy, the semantic inference problem can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and then solved using reinforcement learning (RL). The obtained formal specification can be viewed as an interpretable classifier, which, on the one hand, can classify desirable and undesirable behaviors, and, on the other hand, is expressed in a human-understandable form.

Machine Learning plays an important role in medical systems. Earlier identification of diseases, we can be helped to detect earlier and more accurately, which can save many people as well as reduce the pressure on the system. Lung diseases are the one of the leading cause of death. The early identification and prediction of a lung diseases have become a necessity in the research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. Machine Learning based decision support system provide the contribution to the doctors in their diagnosis decisions. Project considered about the breathing problems of patients as well as Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Tuberculosis, Pneumothorax and Lung cancer. Machine Learning and Deep Learning used to process data as well as create models for diagnosing patients. Combining the processing of patient information with data from chest X-rays, using CNN with the well-known pre-trained model, Caps Net network for data this form are the methods used for this project to identify the lung diseases. Initially studied and analyzed the data set, then apply Machine Learning and Deep Learning to predict that the patient has a lung disease or not.

Trained on vast troves of digitized slides showing an enormous variety of tumors, AI systems will likely provide more accurate diagnoses than human pathologists, at least on fairly rote diagnostic tasks. To harness the power of deep learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), there arises a difficulty in training a CNN from scratch because it requires large amount of computing power and also large amount of training data. The latter aspect in training a CNN turns out to be an obstacle in the case of medical image analysis. Previous works have addressed this difficulty and have demonstrated that the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient training provide a performance better than training a CNN from scratch. In this paper, we provide a comparison of the results obtained by using weights pre-trained on medical images from CheXNet dataset with the results obtained by using weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. We performed experiments on the Chest X-ray dataset obtained from Kaggle. A 121-layer DenseNet when trained on top of a finely tuned CheXNet model, a test accuracy of 88.78% was obtained with precision, recall and F1-score of 0.71, 0.97 and 0.81 respectively. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that: 1) A finely tuned deep CNN model when used as a base for training dataset of medical images provided better accuracy than the CNN model trained from scratch by generating initial random weights. 2) The use of deep CNN's pre-trained weights on a medical image dataset provides better performance for medical image classification in terms of accuracy, precision and recall, than models trained on natural images like ImageNet dataset.;"[Mahajan, Sarang; Shah, Urmil; Tambe, Rucha; Agrawal, Mohit] Pune Inst Comp Technol, Dept Comp Engn, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Garware, Bhushan] Persistent Syst Ltd, Pune, Maharashtra, India";Mahajan, S (corresponding author), Pune Inst Comp Technol, Dept Comp Engn, Pune, Maharashtra, India.;"smsmahajan34@gmail.com; urmil2807@gmail.com; ruchatambe2598@gmail.com; agrawalm038@gmail.com; bhushan_garware@persistent.com";;;;;;20;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-5386-8075-9;;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;6;Engineering, Multidisciplinary;Engineering;BP6YB;WOS:000560958400023;;;;;2020-12-16;

Organizational decisions, artificial intelligence, machine learning, time critical processes, analytics, etc. are driven by highly profiled data. Data gives an organization the ability to act in a corresponding situation and hence, keep up with the market. Financial returns are directly associated with the quality of data being used. Today's world has experienced a data explosion with the advent of data sources like Hadoop, data lakes, clusters and many more. Even more, the day to day devices that we use collect data to present meaningful statistics to us. There is an exponential increase in data volumes which are characterized by heterogeneous data formats and disparate data sources which in turn is complicating the task of providing uniform and profiled data to the business users for analysis. Warehousing is also not able to cope up with the on-demand real-time data access. Holistic view of the entire data is extremely difficult to achieve and takes a considerable amount of time which is slowing down an organization's decision making capabilities. The complexity of the current systems has increased due to the interconnected nature of widely distributed systems which share data. Dirty data i.e. data which is inaccurate, inconsistent, unclean or incomplete is spread all across. As all the data is unrequired garbage data, there is no point in developing your business intelligence over this data.

It achieves classification based on membership function and fuzzy rules which can deal with the uncertainty of data and has semantics. However, the definition of fuzzy rules requires prior knowledge. And fuzzy rules is too sample to achieve high accuracy of classification for classification of handwritten digits. The classifier proposed in this paper combines convolution with fuzzy classifier to classify handwritten digits. The classifier can be divided into two parts: convolution feature extraction part and Gauss membership calculation part. Using back propagation algorithm, the classifier parameters are trained by a large number of labeled data. It can independently extract useful features of handwritten digits to build handwriting feature prototypes, and establish membership functions according to feature prototypes. Experiments on MNIST datasets show that, compared with traditional fuzzy classifiers, the proposed fuzzy classifier can greatly improve the accuracy with less raised time complexity. For MNIST datasets, the proposed fuzzy classifier with convolution can reach higher classification accuracy.;"[Yin, Rui; Lu, Wei] Dalian Univ Technol, Dalian, Peoples R China";Yin, R (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Dalian, Peoples R China.;"1024183360@qq.com; luwei@dlut.edu.cn";;;;;;17;0;0;0;0;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;2194-5357;2194-5365;"978-3-030-21920-8; 978-3-030-21919-2";ADV INTELL SYST;;;2019;1000;;;;;;738;745;;10.1007/978-3-030-21920-8_65;;;8;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied";"Computer Science; Mathematics";BP6YH;WOS:000560974300065;;;;;2020-12-16;

This article examines the question have AI technologies and their related hype already affects interaction design practice in the Western industry. It looks at the potential impact in tools, processes and products of interaction design. It highlights three potentially significant themes which stand out of the hype: 1) AI utilization as a technology push 2) generative AI, and 3) the ethics of AI. Each theme is analyzed to derive the claim that for now, AI has little specific impact on interaction design. On a closer observation, generative AI is one the themes that promises the biggest change in the longer run but is simultaneously an elusive hope, which may never lead to anything but AI-augmented creativity support tools, some of which already exist. The article describes the AI hype is partially positive, partially problematic for the advancement of design goals. The hype contributes positively by helping to surface healthy ethical debates that give more credence to designers' long-term attempts to be user-centered and ethical. This ethical discussion tends to neglect the fact that the ethical burden bestowed upon algorithms is not a new one but was going on long before the big data fuzz. It is evidently now more critical than ever. This articles' intention is to inform the academic researchers working on human-computer interaction and interaction design about the need to continue developing human-centered AI for both general audiences and specifically for interaction designers. There are already promising examples of HCI research that show potential to affect design practice. Common to all is that they do not attempt to roll out a full generative AI solution but rather support human designers in iterative and somewhat well-constrained tasks. Overall it seems that by 2020, interaction designers will be increasingly working on technology that involves AI elements, but those elements itself will not yet be core of how their work is carried out. Awareness of the ethical challenges and technical affordances related to AI technology and its utilization will become more important than the integration of AI into the interaction design process in the short term.

The mixed polarization equivalent model parameter identification method using frequency domain dielectric spectrum is studied. Firstly, the relationship between the frequency domain spectrum and the circuit parameters is derived based on the mixed polarization equivalent circuit. Secondly, the objective function of the equations for solving the multivariate parameters is established, and the artificial intelligence algorithm is used to solve the parameters. Finally, the method is used to verify the identification of the method. Feasibility and accuracy of mixed polarization equivalent model parameters. The calculation results show that the mixed equivalent model considering interface polarization can more accurately reflect the relaxation process of oil-paper insulation. Compared with the time domain dielectric spectrum parameter identification method, the identification method based on frequency domain dielectric spectrum has the advantages of simple solving process and accurate and reliable parameter calculation results.;"[Ye, Rong; Cai, Jinding; Chen, Qunjing] Fuzhou Univ, Coll Elect Engn & Automat, Fuzhou 350108, Fujian, Peoples R China";Ye, R (corresponding author), Fuzhou Univ, Coll Elect Engn & Automat, Fuzhou 350108, Fujian, Peoples R China.;623452500@qq.com;;;;;;10;0;0;1;1;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;1755-1307;;;IOP C SER EARTH ENV;IOP Conf.

One the most important algorithms used for similarity search is known as K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (KNN) which is widely adopted for predictive analysis, text categorization, image recognition etc. but comes at the cost of high computation. Large companies that process big data on modern data centers adopt this technique combined with approximations on algorithm level in order to compute critical workloads every second. However, a significant computation and energy overhead is formed further with the high dimensional nearest neighbor queries. In this paper, we deploy a hardware accelerated approximate KNN algorithm built upon FAISS framework (Facebook Artificial Intelligence Similarity Search) using FPGA-OpenCL platforms. The FPGA architecture on this framework addresses the problem of vector indexing on training and adding large-scale high-dimensional data. The proposed solution uses an in memory FPGA format that outperforms other high performance systems in terms of speed and energy efficiency. The experiments were done on Xilinx Alveo U200 FPGA achieving up to 115x accelerator-only speed-up over single-core CPU and 2.4 x end-to-end system speed-up over a 36 -thread Xeon CPU.

During motors normal operation, some unexpected damages may occur, resulting in economic losses.

The electrical winding faults, namely the stator inter-turns short circuits and rotor bar damages constitutes around 40% of all faults of the induction motors. Nowadays, faults early detection systems play an essential role in IMs drive control systems. In the aim of faults detection process automation, diagnostic systems are increasingly based on artificial intelligence methods.

The performance of the pump deteriorates for various reasons, such as cavitation, sedimentation of silt and water hammering, electrical and mechanical faults. Performance of the pump under silt-laden and identification of silt is seldom studied. It causes severe damage in the pumping system. Identification of sludge particles can productively result in energy savings, water conservation, and energy efficiency. With the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence, pumps can incorporate these methods to become self-reliant in the identification of type and concentration of silt while pumping the fluid.

To mitigate such faults and assure enhanced services to consumers, power system operators need to deploy appropriate hard and soft-computing solutions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to fault mitigation based on a new type of artificial intelligence technique dedicated to time series prediction called Auditory Machine Intelligence (AMI). The actual fault mitigation approach uses a Resonant Fault Current Limiter (RFCL) to fine-tune inductances in circuit in order to estimate the clearance times for a fault. The fault mitigation approach is cast as a time series problem where the resonant inductances (L) and associated clearance times (t(c)) are re-sequenced in a temporal aggregated fashion; this approach is then applied to a double-circuit transmission line (Alaoji-Afam sub-transmission) of the Nigerian power network. The results using the proposed technique on a generated L-t(c) sequence are compared with that of the Group Method of Data Handling for time series (GMDH (time-series)) which is a state-of-the-art neural network; the results indicate that the both techniques are competitive but the AMI technique will outperform the GMDH (time-series) to the tune of 0.57% for a number of GMDH (time-series) and AMI equal simulation trials.";"[Wokoma, Biobele A.] Rivers State Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Port Harcourt, Nigeria; [Osegi, Emmanuel N.] NOUN, Dept Informat Technol, Lagos, Nigeria";Wokoma, BA (corresponding author), Rivers State Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Port Harcourt, Nigeria.;"biobele.wokoma@ust.edu.ng; emmaosegi@gmail.com";;;;;;16;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-0713-4;;;;2019;;;;;;;87;+;;;;;5;"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP6PM;WOS:000560366400014;;;;;2020-12-16;

To avoid power outages, utility companies obligation to identify and locate the main causes of faults as soon as possible to protect energy systems. In this paper, a new technique for fault classification and detection in the transmission lines of micro-grids using a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and a Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is proposed. MATLAB is used to complete the simulation and training process of the neural network. The Daubechies4 mother wavelet 'Db4' is used to decompose the high-frequency components of these signals. Wavelet Transform Coefficients (WTCs) and Wavelet Energy Coefficients (WPCs) are used to classify faults and detect patterns that are used as inputs for back propagation in neural network training. This information is then fed into the neural network to classify and detect the fault. This paper proposes a Wavelet Transform (WT)-based fault-detection method and disturbance-recognition method. To detect the faults, voltage signals are collected under fault conditions and processed by WT. The simulation also shows that the new algorithm is reliable and accurate.;[Abdulwahid, Ali Hadi] Southern Tech Univ, Engn Tech Coll, Dept Elect Engn Tech, Basra, Iraq;Abdulwahid, AH (corresponding author), Southern Tech Univ, Engn Tech Coll, Dept Elect Engn Tech, Basra, Iraq.;dr.alhajji_ali@yahoo.com;;;;;;11;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-0713-4;;;;2019;;;;;;;303;308;;;;;6;"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP6PM;WOS:000560366400045;;;;;2020-12-16;

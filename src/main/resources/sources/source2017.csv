In the classification problem the outcome yields one of a discrete set of values thus, assumptions on them could be established to obtain the most likely prediction model at the training stage. In this paper, a novel case-based model selection method is proposed, which combines hypothesis testing from a discrete set of expected outcomes and feature extraction within a cross-validated classification stage. This wrapper-type procedure acts on fully-observable variables under hypothesis-testing and improves the classification accuracy on the test set, or keeps its performance at least at the level of the statistical classifier. The model selection strategy in the cross validation loop allows building an ensemble classifier that could improve the performance of any expert and intelligence system, particularly on small sample-size datasets. Experiments were carried out on several databases yielding a clear improvement on the baseline, i.e., SPECT dataset Acc = 86.35 +/- 1.51, with Sen = 91.10 +/- 2.77, and Spe = 81.11 +/- 1.61. In addition, the CV error estimate for the classifier under our approach was found to be an almost unbiased estimate (as the baseline approach) of the true error that the classifier would incur on independent data.

In this sense, it is common that traditional optimization algorithms fail in local optimal values. The Sine Cosine Algorithms (SCA) has been recently proposed; it is a global optimization approach based on two trigonometric functions. SCA uses the sine and cosine functions to modify a set of candidate solutions; such operators create a balance between exploration and exploitation of the search space. However, like other similar approaches, SCA tends to be stuck into sub-optimal regions that it is reflected in the computational effort required to find the best values. This situation occurs due that the operators used for exploration do not work well to analyze the search space. This paper presents an improved version of SCA that considers the opposition based learning (OBL) as a mechanism for a better exploration of the search space generating more accurate solutions. OBL is a machine learning strategy commonly used to increase the performance of metaheuristic algorithms. OBL considers the opposite position of a solution in the search space. Based on the objective function value, the OBL selects the best element between the original solution and its opposite position; this task increases the accuracy of the optimization process. The hybridization of concepts from different fields is crucial in intelligent and expert systems; it helps to combine the advantages of algorithms to generate more efficient approaches. The proposed method is an example of this combination; it has been tested over several benchmark functions and engineering problems. Such results support the efficacy of the proposed approach to find the optimal solutions in complex search spaces. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Many computerized techniques have been reported in the literature to diagnose and classify the disease with satisfactory skin cancer detection performance. However, reducing the false detection rate is still challenging and preoccupying because false positives trigger the alarm and require intervention by an expert pathologist for further examination and screening. In this paper, an automatic skin cancer diagnosis system that combines different textural and color features is proposed. New textural and color features are used in a bag-of-features approach for efficient and accurate detection. We particularly claim that the Histogram of Gradients (HG) and the Histogram of Lines (HL) are more suitable for the analysis and classification of dermoscopic and standard skin images than the conventional Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and the Histogram of Oriented Lines (HOL), respectively. The HG and HL are bagged separately using a codebook for each and then combined with other bagged color vector angles and Zernike moments to exploit the color information. The overall system has been assessed through intensive experiments using different classifiers on a dermoscopic image dataset and another standard dataset. Experimental results have shown the superiority of the proposed system over state-of-the-art techniques. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The k-means algorithm is a well-known method in solving data clustering problems. It suffers not only from a high dependency on the algorithm's initial solution but also from the used distance function. A number of algorithms have been proposed to address the centroid initialization problem, but the produced solution does not produce optimum clusters. This paper proposes three algorithms (i) the search algorithm C-LCA that is an improved League Championship Algorithm (LCA), (ii) a search clustering using C-LCA (SC-LCA), and (iii) a hybrid-clustering algorithm called the hybrid of k-means and Chaotic League Championship Algorithm (KSC-LCA) and this algorithm has of two computation stages. The C-LCA employs chaotic adaptation for the retreat and approach parameters, rather than constants, which can enhance the search capability. Furthermore, to overcome the limitation of the original k-means algorithm using the Euclidean distance that cannot handle the categorical attribute type properly, we adopt the Gower distance and the mechanism for handling a discrete value requirement of the categorical value attribute. The proposed algorithms can handle not only the pure numeric data but also the mixed-type data and can find the best centroids containing categorical values. Experiments were conducted on 14 datasets from the UCI repository. The SC-LCA and KSC-LCA competed with 16 established algorithms including the k-means, k-means++, global k-means algorithms, four search clustering algorithms and nine hybrids of k-means algorithm with several state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms. The experimental results show that the SC-LCA produces the cluster with the highest F-Measure on the pure categorical dataset and the KSC-LCA produces the cluster with the highest F-Measure for the pure numeric and mixed-type tested datasets. Out of 14 datasets, there were 13 centroids produced by the SC-LCA that had better F-Measures than that of the k-means algorithm. On the Tic-Tac-Toe dataset containing only categorical attributes, the SC-LCA can achieve an F-Measure of 66.61 that is 21.74 points over that of the k-means algorithm (44.87). The KSC-LCA produced better centroids than k-means algorithm in all 14 datasets; the maximum F-Measure improvement was 11.59 points. However, in terms of the computational time, the SC-LCA and KSC-LCA took more NFEs than the k-means and its variants but the KSC-LCA ranks first and SC-LCA ranks fourth among the hybrid clustering and the search clustering algorithms that we tested. Therefore, the SC-LCA and KSC-LCA are general and effective clustering algorithms that could be used when an expert or intelligent system requires an accurate high-speed cluster selection.

However, the lack of integration between the radiologist and CAD systems restrains the rate of progress as well as the reach of such advancements in clinical use. This article aims to improve the clinical efficiency of ultrasound based CAD systems for classification of breast lesions by integrating back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN), support vector machine (SVM) and radiologist feedback. The acquired breast ultrasound images were subjected to wavelet based filtering in order to reduce speckle noise followed by feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Experiments on a database of 178 ultrasound images of breast anomalies (88 benign and 90 malignant) show that the proposed methodology achieves classification accuracy of 98.621% and 98.276%, respectively, when all 457 and 19 most relevant features selected by multi-criteria feature selection method were used for classification. The accuracy achieved is significantly higher than that using conventional classifiers based on BPANN and SVM. Further, it is found that integrating expert opinion in CAD systems improves its overall performance. The quantitative results obtained are discussed in light of some recently reported studies.

Multilevel thresholding is a widely used technique that uses threshold values for image segmentation. However, from a computational stand point, the search for optimal threshold values presents a challenging task, especially when the number of thresholds is high. To get the optimal threshold values, a meta-heuristic or optimization algorithm is required. Our proposed algorithm is referred to as Rr-cr-IJADE, which is an improved version of R-cr-IJADE. Rr-cr-IJADE uses a newly proposed mutation strategy, DE/rand-to-rank/1, to improve the search success rate. The strategy uses the parameter F adaptation, crossover rate repairing, and the direction from a randomly selected individual to a ranking-based leader. The complexity of the proposed algorithm does not increase, compared to its ancestor. The performance of Rr-cr-IJADE, using Otsu's function as the objective function, was evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and swarm intelligence algorithms (SIs), under both 'low-level' and 'high-level' experimental sets, Within the 'low-level' sets, the number of thresholds varied from 2 to 16, within 20 real images. For the 'high-level' sets, the threshold numbers chosen were 24, 32, 40, 48, 56 and 64, within 2 synthetic pseudo images, 7 satellite images, and three real images taken from the set of 20 real images. The proposed Rr-cr-IJADE achieved higher success rates with lower threshold value distortion (TVD) than the other state-of-the-art EA and SI algorithms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The adaptive neural network is constructed based on the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) portfolio matrix. The adaptive neural network was established by applying the simulated annealing algorithm. The model enables decision makers to evaluate and assess human resources potential in accordance with the environment and its circumstances. The purpose of creating this model is to enable insight into the existing potential and plan assets to improve and promote the employees' potential in a company. The model allows the priorities of the suggested strategies to be defined, which eliminates one of the flaws of the classic BCG portfolio matrix. In this neuro-fuzzy model the input variables are described using fuzzy sets that are represented by Gaussian functions. Using expert reasoning a unique knowledge base is formed which enables employees to be scheduled by strategies. The portfolio model is tested in a realistic industrial environment.

It focuses on the critical case of anti-fraud rule repositories for the inspection of Card Not Present (CNP) transactions in e-commerce environments. The main motivation is to examine and curate anti-fraud rule datasets to avoid semantic conflicts that could lead the underpinning expert system to incorrectly perform, e.g., by accepting fraudulent transactions and/or by discarding harmless ones. The proposed approach is based on Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) technologies to develop an anti-fraud rule ontology and reasoning tasks, respectively. The three main contributions of this work are: first, the creation of a conceptual knowledge model for describing anti-fraud rules and their relationships; second, the development of semantic rules as conflict resolution methods for anti-fraud expert systems; third, experimental facts are gathered to evaluate and validate the proposed model. A real-world use case In the e-cotnmerce (e-Tourlsm) Industry Is used to explain the ontological knowledge design and its use. The experiments show that ontological approaches can effectively discover and classify conflicts in rule-based expert systems in the field of anti-fraud applications. The proposal is also applicable to other domains where knowledge rule bases are involved. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, it is crucial to detect any possible symptoms of a leak as soon as possible. Most of existing leak detection techniques require specialized equipment to be used, while purely software-based methods rely solely on data analysis and are very desirable since they can be deployed on petrol stations without any changes to the existing infrastructure. Moreover, such techniques can be considered as complementary to the hardware leak detection systems, as they provide additional security level. In this paper we present the TUBE algorithm, which detects fuel leaks from underground storage tanks, using only standard measurements that are normally registered on petrol stations, i.e. the amount of stored, sold, and delivered fuel. The TUBE algorithm is an autonomous solution capable of making decisions independently as well as supporting human-made decisions and thus can be considered as an expert leak detection system. The TUBE algorithm introduces a new data mining technique for trend detection and cleaning data over time series, which can be easily adapted to any other problem domain. A trend detection technique, called tubes, created for the TUBE algorithm is a novel data analysis method that allows to envelop uncertainties and oscillations in data and produce stable trends. Trend interpretation technique described in this paper has been designed especially for fuel leak detection purposes using our industrial experience. This paper includes a step-by-step usage example of the TUBE algorithm and its evaluation according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency requirements for leakage detection systems (the EPA SIR standard). Such an evaluation involves calculating the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm. The TUBE algorithm has obtained 98.84% probability of detection and 0.07% probability of false alarm while rejecting 42.22% of analyzed datasets due to their uncertainty. Rejecting datasets from analysis is compliant with the EPA SIR standard; however, rejection rate higher than 20% is not acceptable. Therefore we have evaluated the two-phase filtering stage of the algorithm in order to find the best combination of filters as means of data cleaning. Moreover, we have discussed the results pointing at the overall data quality problem, since it is the main cause of rejecting some datasets from the analysis. Finally, the TUBE algorithm has obtained 93.11% probability of detection and 0.73% probability of false alarm for the best combination of all parameters with 15.56% rejection rate, which is acceptable by the EPA SIR standard. The value of probability of detection is not fully compliant with the EPA SIR standard where 95% probability of detection with probability of false alarm lower than 5% is required. We have found that the requirements for the aforementioned probabilities have been completely fulfilled for datasets representing manifolded tank systems but not for single tank datasets. Such a situation was unexpected since manifolded tank systems are generally claimed to be more complex for analysis as they are in fact systems of multiple single tanks directly connected. In this paper we have also measured the time and memory complexity of the TUBE algorithm as well as discussed the issues connected to the TUBE algorithm deployment on petrol stations using our industrial experience in the topic.

Most of the previous studies focus only on fraudulent (or intentional) restatements and the literature has largely ignored unintentional restatements. Earlier studies have shown that large scale unintentional restatements can be equally detrimental and may erode investors' confidence. Therefore it is important for us to pay a close to the significant unintentional restatements as well. A lack of focus on unintentional restatements could lead to a more relaxed internal control environment and lessen the efforts for curbing managerial oversights and instances of misreporting. In order to address this research gap, we focus on developing predictive models based on both intentional (fraudulent) and unintentional (erroneous) financial restatements using a comprehensive real dataset that includes 3,513 restatement cases over a period of 2001 to 2014. To the best of our knowledge it is the most comprehensive dataset used In the financial restatement predictive models. Our study also makes contributions to the datamining literature by (i) focussing on various datamining techniques and presenting a comparative analysis, (ii) ensuring the robustness of various predictive models over different time periods. We have employed all widely used data mining techniques in this area, namely, Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) Classifier while developing the predictive models. We find that ANN outperforms other data mining algorithms in our empirical setup in terms of accuracy and area under the ROC curve. It is worth noting that our models remain consistent over the full sample period (2001-2014), pre-financial-crisis period (2001-2008), and post-financial-crisis period (2009-2014). We believe this study will benefit academics, regulators, policymakers and investors. In particular, regulators and policymakers can pay a close attention to the suspected firms and investors can take actions in advance to reduce their investment risks. The results can also help improving expert and intelligent systems by providing more insights on both intentional and unintentional financial restatements. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

First, a proposal of a model is presented. This model aims at introducing adaptivity to current e-learning systems, which are rigid and limited in offering a truly personalised learning to individual students. Many of current e-learning systems enable personalised learning. However, in this paper, there is a new, innovative approach proposed for an adaptive personalised e-learning system. The primary area of our research is English as a second language (ESL). Adaptivity in our view is considered as an ability of the system to adapt to student's knowledge and characteristics. This pedagogical perspective requires introduction of such processes that enable to work the pedagogical aspects of teaching/learning. The required processes are of informatics nature. The proposed model was subsequently designed into a real application. Finally, the application was implemented and verified on a real data set. The results are also provided. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to compare the accuracy, measured as priority level, between two Swedish dispatch protocols - the three-graded priority protocol Medical Index and a newly developed prototype, the four-graded priority protocol, RETTS-A. Methods: A simulation study was carried out at the Emergency Medical Communication Centre (EMCC) in Stockholm, Sweden, between October and March 2016. Fifty-three voluntary telecommunicators working at SOS Alarm were recruited nationally. Each telecommunicator handled 26 emergency medical calls, simulated by experienced standard patients. Manuscripts for the scenarios were based on recorded real-life calls, representing the six most common complaints. A cross-over design with 13 + 13 calls was used. Priority level and medical condition for each scenario was set through expert consensus and used as gold standard in the study. Results: A total of 1293 calls were included in the analysis. For priority level, n = 349 (54.0%) of the calls were assessed correctly with Medical Index and n = 309 (48.0%) with RETTS-A (p = 0.012). Sensitivity for the highest priority level was 82.6% (95% confidence interval: 76.6-87.3%) in the Medical Index and 54.0% (44.3-63.4%) in RETTS-A. Overtriage was 37.9% (34.2-41.7%) in the Medical Index and 28.6% (25.2-32.2%) in RETTS-A. The corresponding proportion of undertriage was 6.3% (4.7-8.5%) and 23.4% (20.3-26.9%) respectively. Conclusion: In this simulation study we demonstrate that Medical Index had a higher accuracy for priority level and less undertriage than the new prototype RETTS-A. The overall accuracy of both protocols is to be considered as low. Overtriage challenges resource utilization while undertriage threatens patient safety. The results suggest that in order to improve patient safety both protocols need revisions in order to guarantee safe emergency medical dispatching.;"[Torlen, Klara; Kurland, Lisa; Castren, Maaret; Bohm, Katarina] Karolinska Inst, Sodersjukhuset, Dept Clin Sci & Educ, SE-11883 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kurland, Lisa] Orebro Univ, Dept Med Sci, Orebro, Sweden; [Kurland, Lisa] Orebro Univ Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Orebro, Sweden; [Castren, Maaret] Helsinki Univ Hosp, Dept Emergency Med & Serv, Helsinki, Finland; [Castren, Maaret] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; [Olanders, Knut] Lund Univ Hosp, Dept Anaesthesiol & ICU, Lund, Sweden; [Bohm, Katarina] Soder Sjukhuset, Dept Emergency Med, Stockholm, Sweden";Torlen, K (corresponding author), Karolinska Inst, Sodersjukhuset, Dept Clin Sci & Educ, SE-11883 Stockholm, Sweden.;klara.torlen@ki.se;;;;;;40;3;3;0;7;BIOMED CENTRAL LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;1757-7241;;;SCAND J TRAUMA RESUS;Scand.

This, together with the waning interest in surgery as a career among medical students, is a serious issue confronted by hospitals and healthcare systems worldwide. We, therefore, developed and implemented an intensive one-day surgical-skill training course for two purposes; it would improve surgical skills and increase interest in surgery among medical students. Methods: The surgical-skill training program is named Surgical Skill Weekend (SSW) and it includes hands-on training sessions for surgical-suturing techniques and advanced surgical procedures (i.e. laparoscopic and robotassisted surgery), hybrid simulation sessions, and an operating-room session where aforementioned sessions are all put together. By the end of the program, students' improvements in surgical-suturing skills were assessed by experts in a form of checklist, and changes in the interest in a surgical career, if there were any, were answered by the students who participated in the program. Results: A total of ninety-one (91) medical students participated in the 2015 and 2016 SSW courses. Their overall satisfaction level with the course was very high (Very satisfied: 78%, Quite satisfied: 22%). All of the participant's surgical-suturing skills significantly improved (median score range: 14-20, P < 0.05) and their interest in a surgical career increased significantly (from 56% to 81%, P < 0.05) by completing the program.

But, high capital cost and uncertainty regarding future cost and performance improvements are barriers to investment in water electrolysis. Expert elicitations can support decision-making when data are sparse and their future development uncertain. Therefore, this study presents expert views on future capital cost, lifetime and efficiency for three electrolysis technologies: alkaline (AEC), proton exchange membrane (PEMEC) and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC). Experts estimate that increased R&D funding can reduce capital costs by 0-24%, while production scale-up alone has an impact of 17-30%. System lifetimes may converge at around 60,000-90,000 h and efficiency improvements will be negligible. In addition to innovations on the cell-level, experts highlight improved production methods to automate manufacturing and produce higher quality components. Research into SOECs with lower electrode polarisation resistance or zero-gap AECs could undermine the projected dominance of PEMEC systems. This study thereby reduces barriers to investment in water electrolysis and shows how expert elicitations can help guide near-term investment, policy and research efforts to support the development of electrolysis for low-carbon energy systems.

Objectives The aim of this article is to provide an overview of different initiatives and policies that may influence the uptake of biosimilars in different European countries. Recommendations will be formulated on how to create sustainable uptake. Methods An overview of policies on biosimilars was obtained via a questionnaire, supplemented with relevant articles. Topics were organized in five themes: availability, pricing, reimbursement, demand-side policies, and recommendations to enhance uptake. Results In all countries studied, biological medicines are available. Restrictions are mainly dependent on local organization of the healthcare system. Countries are willing to include biosimilars for reimbursement, but for commercial reasons they are not always marketed. In two thirds of countries, originator and biosimilar products may be subjected to internal reference pricing systems. Few countries have implemented specific incentives targeting physicians. Several countries are implementing pharmacist substitution; however, the scope and rules governing such substitution tend to vary between these countries. Reported educational policies tend to target primarily physicians, whereas fewer initiatives were reported for patients. Recommendations as proposed by the different country experts ranged from the need for information and communication on biosimilars to competitive pricing, more support for switching and guidance on substitution. Conclusions Most countries have put in place specific supply-side policies for promoting access to biosimilars. To supplement these measures, we propose that investments should be made to clearly communicate on biosimilars and educate stakeholders. Especially physicians need to be informed on the entry and use of biosimilars in order to create trust. When physicians are well-informed on the treatment options, further incentives should be offered to prescribe biosimilars. Gainsharing can be used as an incentive to prescribe, dispense or use biosimilars.

However, few interventions focus on improving healthcare worker (HCW) competencies and skills for provision of high-quality adolescent care. Standardized patients (SPs) are trained actors who work with HCWs in mock clinical encounters to improve clinical assessment, communication, and empathy skills. This stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial will evaluate a clinical training intervention utilizing SPs to improve HCW skills in caring for HIV-positive AYA, resulting in increased retention in care. Methods/design: The trial will utilize a stepped-wedge design to evaluate a training intervention using SPs to train HCWs in assessment, communication, and empathy skills for AYA HIV care. We will recruit 24 clinics in Kenya with an active electronic medical record (EMR) system and at least 40 adolescents enrolled in HIV care per site. Stratified randomization by county will be used to assign clinics to one of four waves - time periods when they receive the intervention - with each wave including six clinics. From each clinic, up to 10 HCWs will participate in the training intervention. SP training includes didactic sessions in adolescent health, current guidelines, communication skills, and motivational interviewing techniques. HCW participants will rotate through seven standardized SP scenarios, followed by SP feedback, group debriefing, and remote expert evaluation. AYA outcomes will be assessed using routine clinic data. The primary outcome is AYA retention in HIV care, defined as returning for first follow-up visit within 6 months of presenting to care, or returning for a first follow-up visit after re-engagement in care in AYA with a previous history of being lost to follow-up. Secondary outcomes include HCW competency scores, AYA satisfaction with care, and AYA clinical outcomes including CD4 and viral load. Additional analyses will determine cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Discussion: This trial will contribute valuable information to HIV programs in Kenya and other low-resource settings, providing a potentially scalable strategy to improve quality of care and retention in critical HIV services in this population.;"[Wilson, Kate S.;

The search for more sustainable system for maritime-hinterland transportation has culminated in the development of the synchromodality concept. In this study, mathematical model is formulated and used to experiment the feasibility and applicability of the concept of synchromodality in Ghana. Data for the numerical analysis for the given corridor is obtained from online sources and through the direct interview of experts in the field. Coupled with this, expert judgment of the researchers is also used. The results of the optimisation were plotted in a graph using OriginPro 9.0, 32-Bit Software. From the study results, the synchromodal service design yielded a difference of about 22% cost savings compared with the unimodal service due to the usage of fewer of trucks. The waiting penalty at the terminal of origin is also considerably reduced. When compared with the intermodal service, the synchromodal service offered a cost savings of about 8%. The results of this research show that the innovative concept has the potentials of ensuring sustainability, flexibility and cost reduction among other things, in freight transportation sector. The sustainability is obtained through better modal split and parallel use of modes for maritime-hinterland freight transportation. Furthermore, the study reveals that synchromodality has the potentials of increasing transport service utilisation. The benefits of environmental sustainability are achieved through less usage of trucks resulting in a reduction in environmental pollution, road congestion, noise, etc.;"[Agbo, Aaron Agbenyegah] Ghana Prisons Serv, Dept Logist & Transportat Serv, Accra, Ghana; [Zhang, Yanwei] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Logist Engn, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China";Agbo, AA (corresponding author), Ghana Prisons Serv, Dept Logist & Transportat Serv, Accra, Ghana.;"aaron.agbo200@yahoo.com; zytg@wut.edu.cn";Agbo, Aaron Agbenyegah/Q-5102-2016;;;;;89;6;6;3;23;TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS;OSLO;KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY;2331-1916;;;COGENT ENG;Cogent Eng.;DEC 27;2017;4;1;;;;;;;1421005;10.1080/23311916.2017.1421005;;;21;Engineering, Multidisciplinary;Engineering;FS5RQ;WOS:000419856300001;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-02-18;

Compare to conventional forklift vehicle, a robotic arm is more efficient and reliable because it requires no human operator. Unfortunately, a robotic system needs high investment and maintenance cost, commonly due to its control system as a consequence of its high Degree of Freedom (DOF). For medium enterprises it is still difficult to find high capacity but affordable system. Customized system with a hydraulic power pack is a considerable alternative solution since speed and accuracy is not a mandatory. Therefore, this paper provide a preliminary study report for a low DOF hydraulic robotic arm. Basically, this is a conceptual product development study. This research used the first 5 activity stages of Concept Development Phase from Generic Development Process. The first stage was Identifying Customer Needs which involved automation experts from academician. The second stage was Translating Customer Needs into Technical Requirement. The third stage was Generating Concept Alternatives which was more focused on mechanical structure alternatives. The fourth stage was Selecting The Best Concept which was based on valuation with some technical criteria. The final stage was Testing The Best Concept which addressed to evaluate its operational abilities by building a prototype. The development process produce three design alternatives which featured with only three DOF linkage system. A flexible material handling with PRR (Prismatic-Revolute-Revolute) robotic arm then selected as the best concept. The robotic arm was inspired by VANTA MD410ib/300 Palletizing Robot. The arm is actuated with a hydraulic cylinders for each DOF. The system was designed to handle material from or to a graded vertical shelf. A 450 mm sized prototype was build using small plastic hydraulics components. From several trial, we found a critical part on the second link actuator thus an additional counter balance or spring system should take in to consideration.;"[Priadythama, Ilham] Univ Sebelas Maret, Dept Ind Engn, Surakarta, Indonesia; [Laksono, Pringgo Widyo] Univ Sebelas Maret, Ctr Study Technol Dev & Ind Collaborat, Surakarta, Indonesia";Laksono, PW (corresponding author), Univ Sebelas Maret, Ctr Study Technol Dev & Ind Collaborat, Surakarta, Indonesia.;"priadythama@gmail.com; pringgo@ft.uns.ac.id";Laksono, Pringgo Widyo/AAZ-4268-2020;"Laksono, Pringgo Widyo/0000-0003-0502-5453; Priadythama, Ilham/0000-0001-7330-2921";;;;14;0;0;0;2;TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS;OSLO;KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY;2331-1916;;;COGENT ENG;Cogent Eng.;DEC 27;2017;4;1;;;;;;;1421416;10.1080/23311916.2017.1421416;;;8;Engineering, Multidisciplinary;Engineering;FS5RU;WOS:000419856700001;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-02-18;

PBL can be further reinforced through the utilization of metacognitive skills on the part of the students. Such approaches are particularly useful in Process Systems Engineering (PSE) and Process Integration (PI), where proficiency in the use of methodologies for problem-solving is paramount. In this paper, we describe how such educational strategies can be used to improve learning outcomes through the use of the process graph (P-graph) framework for the synthesis of polygeneration systems, in addition to conventional approaches using lectures and drills. Practical pedagogic implications are then discussed for potential use in teaching related topics in PSE/PI. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A two-layer algorithm based on metaheuristics is proposed for the optimal operation of smart distribution network in self-healing mode considering microgrid (MG) and direct load control (DLC) programme capability in the presence of micro turbine (MT) and energy storage (ES) in the distribution network. In the first layer, a new approach based on the graph theory is proposed to find the optimal forming of MGs, while in the second layer the optimal energy management of MGs, including storages, is determined considering self-healing mode. To illustrate the advantage of the proposed method, the proposed algorithm is implemented on the modified IEEE 33 bus distribution network.;"[Zadsar, Masoud; Haghifam, Mahmoud Reza; Larimi, Sayyed Majid Miri] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Elect & Comp Engn, POB 14115-143, Tehran, Iran";Larimi, SMM (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Elect & Comp Engn, POB 14115-143, Tehran, Iran.;m.miri@modares.ac.ir;"Zadsar, Masoud/AAK-1122-2020; Larimi, Sayyed Majid Miri/K-3478-2019; Haghifam, Mahmoud-Reza/AAC-8901-2019";;;;;35;26;26;1;33;INST ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY-IET;HERTFORD;MICHAEL FARADAY HOUSE SIX HILLS WAY STEVENAGE, HERTFORD SG1 2AY, ENGLAND;1751-8687;1751-8695;;IET GENER TRANSM DIS;IET Gener.

Here we adapt a least-cost-path solver and specially tailored cost functions to rapidly interpolate structural features between manually defined control points in point cloud and raster datasets. We implement the method in the geographic information system QGIS and the point cloud and mesh processing software CloudCompare. Using these implementations, the method can be applied to a variety of three-dimensional (3-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) datasets, including high-resolution aerial imagery, digital outcrop models, digital elevation models (DEMs) and geophysical grids. We demonstrate the algorithm with four diverse applications in which we extract (1) joint and contact patterns in high-resolution orthophotographs, (2) fracture patterns in a dense 3-D point cloud, (3) earthquake surface ruptures of the Greendale Fault associated with the M(w)7(.)1 Darfield earthquake (New Zealand) from high-resolution light detection and ranging (lidar) data, and (4) oceanic fracture zones from bathymetric data of the North Atlantic. The approach improves the consistency of the interpretation process while retaining expert guidance and achieves significant improvements (35-65 %) in digitisation time compared to traditional methods.

This exploratory study aims to provide an overview of the workforce changes implemented as part of integrated chronic care interventions. Methods An interactive and emergent research design was used consisting of a literature review, qualitative expert questionnaires and case reports. We defined integrated care as interventions targeting at least two of the six Chronic Care Model components. Workforce changes were defined as those changes experienced by clinical and non-clinical staff responsible for public and individual health intervention. Results Seven workforce changes were identified: (1) nurse involvement, (2) multidisciplinary staff, (3) multidisciplinary protocols/pathways, (4) provider training, (5) case manager/care coordinator, (6) team meetings, and (7) new positions. Most interventions included more than one of these workforce changes. Conclusion The results of this study provide detailed insights into the current implementation of workforce changes in integrated care interventions and thereby pave the way for further investigations into the relative effectiveness of different workforce changes within the scope of complex interventions.

After applying standard critical appraisal policy and endorsement procedures, ASCO chose to endorse the ASTRO guideline. Methods The ASTRO guideline was reviewed by ASCO content experts for clinical accuracy and by ASCO methodologists for developmental rigor. On favorable review, an ASCO Expert Panel was convened to review the guideline contents and recommendations. The ASCO guideline approval body, the Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee, approved the final endorsement. Results The ASCO Expert Panel determined that the ASTRO guideline recommendations, published in July 2017, are clear, thorough, and based upon the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO endorsed the ASTRO guideline and added minor qualifying statements. Recommendations Recommendations for the addition of systemic therapy to definitive radiotherapy in the treatment of OPSCC, postoperative radiotherapy with and without systemic therapy following primary surgery of OPSCC, induction chemotherapy in the treatment of OPSCC, and the appropriate dose, fractionation, and volume regimens with and without systemic therapy in the treatment of OPSCC are outlined for a variety of disease stages and clinical scenarios.

A new measure called the Staff Assessment of Engagement with Evidence (SAGE) incorporates an interview that explores policymakers' research use within discrete policy documents and a scoring tool that quantifies the extent of policymakers' research use based on the interview transcript and analysis of the policy document itself. We aimed to conduct a preliminary investigation of the usability, sensitivity, and reliability of the scoring tool in measuring research use by policymakers. Methods: Nine experts in health policy research and two independent coders were recruited. Each expert used the scoring tool to rate a random selection of 20 interview transcripts, and each independent coder rated 60 transcripts. The distribution of scores among experts was examined, and then, interrater reliability was tested within and between the experts and independent coders. Average-and single-measure reliability coefficients were computed for each SAGE subscales. Results: Experts' scores ranged from the limited to extensive scoring bracket for all subscales. Experts as a group also exhibited at least a fair level of interrater agreement across all subscales. Single-measure reliability was at least fair except for three subscales: Relevance Appraisal, Conceptual Use, and Instrumental Use. Average-and single-measure reliability among independent coders was good to excellent for all subscales. Finally, reliability between experts and independent coders was fair to excellent for all subscales. Conclusions: Among experts, the scoring tool was comprehensible, usable, and sensitive to discriminate between documents with varying degrees of research use. Secondly, the scoring tool yielded scores with good reliability among the independent coders. There was greater variability among experts, although as a group, the tool was fairly reliable. The alignment between experts' and independent coders' ratings indicates that the independent coders were scoring in a manner comparable to health policy research experts. If the present findings are replicated in a larger sample, end users (e.g. policy agency staff) could potentially be trained to use SAGE to reliably score research use within their agencies, which would provide a cost-effective and time-efficient approach to utilising this measure in practice.;"[Makkar, Steve R.; Williamson, Anna; Redman, Sally] Sax Inst, Level 13,Bldg 10,235 Jones St, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [D'Este, Catherine] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Populat Hlth, NCEPH, 62 Mills Rd, Acton, ACT 0200, Australia";Makkar, SR (corresponding author), Sax Inst, Level 13,Bldg 10,235 Jones St, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.;steve.makkar@saxinstitute.org.au;;;"Centre for Informing Policy in Health with Evidence from Research (CIPHER), an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Centre for Research Excellence [APP1001436]; NSW Ministry of Health; NHMRC Post-Doctoral FellowshipNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [510 391]";This study was funded as part of the Centre for Informing Policy in Health with Evidence from Research (CIPHER), an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Centre for Research Excellence (APP1001436), and administered by the University of Western Sydney.

Accuracy and variability of cardiac function parameters were measured from manual segmentation of rat heart images with and without filtering. Methods: Ten rats were studied using a 7T Varian system. End-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, ejection fraction and left ventricle mass (LVM) were calculated from manual segmentation by two experts on cine-FLASH short-axis slices covering the left ventricle. Series were denoised with an anisotropic diffusion filter, a whole variation regularization or an optimized Rician non-local means (ORNLM) filtering technique. The effect of the different filters was evaluated by the calculation of signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratios, followed by a study of intra-and inter-expert variability of the measurement of physiological parameters. The calculated LVM was compared to the LVM obtained by weighing the heart ex vivo. Results: The SNR and the CNR increased after application of the different filters. The performance of the ORNLM filter was superior for all the parameters of the cardiac function, as judged from the inter-and intra-observer variabilities. Moreover, this filtering technique resulted in the lowest variability in the LVM evaluation. Conclusions: In cardiac MRI of rats, filtering is an interesting alternative that yields better contrast between myocardium and surrounding tissues and the ORNLM filter provided the largest improvements.;"[Tricot, Benoit; Descoteaux, Maxime; Dumont, Matthieu; Tremblay, Luc; Lesur, Olivier; Lepage, Martin] CHUS, Hop Fleurimont, Ctr Imagerie Mol Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [Tricot, Benoit] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Tricot, Benoit] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Descoteaux, Maxime] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Informat, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [Chagnon, Frederic; Lesur, Olivier] CHUS, Hop Fleurimont, Soins Intensifs Med, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [Carpentier, Andre] CHUS Hop Fleurimont, Dept Med, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [Lalande, Alain] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Fac Med, Le2I, 7 Bld Jeanne dArc,BP 87900, F-21079 Dijon, France";Lalande, A (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Fac Med, Le2I, 7 Bld Jeanne dArc,BP 87900, F-21079 Dijon, France.;alain.lalande@u-bourgogne.fr;Lalande, Alain/T-1050-2017;"Lalande, Alain/0000-0002-7970-366X; Lepage, Martin/0000-0002-5363-9487";"<< Programme d'aide financiere interne >> of the Research Centre of the Sherbrooke University Hospital Centre (CRCHUS); CFQCU (Conseil Franco-Quebecois de Cooperation Universitaire) [2014-134/SCAC]";Grant support from the << Programme d'aide financiere interne >> of the Research Centre of the Sherbrooke University Hospital Centre (CRCHUS).

Elevated mammographic breast density (MBD) is an established breast cancer risk factor and is known to mask tumors within the dense tissue. However, the association of MBD with high risk benign breast disease (BBD) is unknown. Method: We analyzed data for 3400 women diagnosed with pathologically confirmed BBD in the Mayo Clinic BBD cohort from 1985-2001, with a clinical MBD measure (either parenchymal pattern (PP) or Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (BI-RADS) density) and expert pathology review. Risk factor information was collected from medical records and questionnaires. MBD was dichotomized as dense (PP classification P2 or DY, or BI-RADS classification c or d) or non-dense (PP classification N1 or P1, or BI-RADS classification a or b). Associations of clinical and histologic characteristics with MBD were examined using logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Of 3400 women in the study, 2163 (64%) had dense breasts. Adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI), there were positive associations of dense breasts with use of hormone therapy (HT), lack of lobular involution, presence of atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH), histologic fibrosis, columnar cell hyperplasia/flat epithelia atypia (CCH/FEA), sclerosing adenosis (SA), cyst, usual ductal hyperplasia, and calcifications. In fully adjusted multivariate models, HT (1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1. 5), ALH (1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.2), lack of lobular involution (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1, compared to complete involution), fibrosis (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.9-2.6) and CCH/FEA (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6) remained significantly associated with high MBD. Conclusion: Our findings support an association between high risk BBD and high MBD, suggesting that risks associated with the latter may act early in breast carcinogenesis.;"[Ghosh, Karthik] Mayo Clin, Breast Diagnost Clin, Gen Internal Med, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN USA; [Vierkant, Robert A.; Frank, Ryan D.; Winham, Stacey; Scott, Christopher G.; Vachon, Celine M.] Mayo Clin, Hlth Sci Res, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55904 USA; [Visscher, Daniel W.] Mayo Clin, Anat Pathol, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN USA; [Pankratz, Vernon S.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Internal Med, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Brandt, Kathleen] Mayo Clin, Dept Radiol, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN USA; [Sherman, Mark E.] Mayo Clin, Hlth Sci Res, 4500 San Pablo Rd, Jacksonville, FL USA; [Radisky, Derek C.] Mayo Clin, Canc Biol, 4500 San Pablo Rd, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA; [Frost, Marlene H.; Hartmann, Lynn C.; Degnim, Amy C.; Vachon, Celine M.] Mayo Clin, Womens Canc Program, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55904 USA; [Hartmann, Lynn C.] Mayo Clin, Med Oncol, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN USA; [Degnim, Amy C.] Mayo Clin, Breast Endocrine Metab & GI Surg, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN USA; [Vachon, Celine M.] Mayo Clin, Dept Hlth Sci Res, Minnesota BioBusiness Ctr 5-81,200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55904 USA";"Vachon, CM (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Hlth Sci Res, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55904 USA.; Vachon, CM (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Womens Canc Program, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55904 USA.; Vachon, CM (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Dept Hlth Sci Res, Minnesota BioBusiness Ctr 5-81,200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55904 USA.";vachon.celine@mayo.edu;"Radisky, Derek/B-6569-2018; Vierkant, Robert/AAP-4927-2020";"Radisky, Derek/0000-0002-1962-8784; Vierkant, Robert/0000-0001-6242-5221";"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 CA187112, R21 CA186734]; Write up and Publish Award, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [R21CA186734, R21CA186734, R01CA187112, R01CA187112, R01CA187112, R01CA187112, R01CA187112] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";This study is supported by grants R01 CA187112 and R21 CA186734 from the National Institutes of Health, and Write up and Publish Award, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic.;;33;13;13;1;1;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;1465-542X;1465-5411;;BREAST CANCER RES;Breast Cancer Res.;DEC 19;2017;19;;;;;;;;134;10.1186/s13058-017-0922-6;;;10;Oncology;Oncology;FQ3ZH;WOS:000418296700002;29258587;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-02-18;

DNA barcoding is conspicuous in almost all areas of the biological sciences and has already been added to the British pharmacopeia and Chinese pharmacopeia for routine herbal drug authentication. However, DNA barcoding for the Korean pharmacopeia still requires significant improvements. Here, we present a DNA barcode reference library for herbal drugs in the Korean pharmacopeia and developed a species identification engine named KP-IDE to facilitate the adoption of this DNA reference library for the herbal drug authentication. Using taxonomy records, specimen records, sequence records, and reference records, KP-IDE can identify an unknown specimen. Currently, there are 6,777 taxonomy records, 1,054 specimen records, 30,744 sequence records (ITS2 and psbA-trnH) and 285 reference records. Moreover, 27 herbal drug materials were collected from the Seoul Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market to give an example for real herbal drugs authentications. Our study demonstrates the prospects of the DNA barcode reference library for the Korean pharmacopeia and provides future directions for the use of DNA barcoding for authenticating herbal drugs listed in other modern pharmacopeias.";"[Liu, Jinxin; Shi, Linchun; Song, Jingyuan; Han, Jianping; Hou, Dianyun; Yao, Hui; Li, Mingyue; Chen, Shilin] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Med Plant Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jinxin; Shi, Linchun; Song, Jingyuan; Han, Jianping; Hou, Dianyun; Yao, Hui; Li, Mingyue; Chen, Shilin] Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jinxin] Chengde Med Coll, Hebei Key Lab Study & Exploitat Chinese Med, Chengde, Peoples R China; [Shi, Linchun; Sun, Wei; Liu, Xia; Chen, Shilin] Chinese Acad Chinese Med Sci, Inst Chinese Mat Med, Beijing, Peoples R China";"Chen, SL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Med Sci, Inst Med Plant Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Chen, SL (corresponding author), Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Chen, SL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Chinese Med Sci, Inst Chinese Mat Med, Beijing, Peoples R China.";slchen@implad.ac.cn;;;"CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences (CIFMS) [2016-I2M-3-016]; College Youth Talent Project of Hebei Province [BJ2016002]; Hebei Provincial Natural Science Foundation [H2017406031]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81703659]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M610815]";We thank Zhigang Hu and Li Xiang for plant materials.

In this paper, we use causal mapping from soft OR to analyse longitudinal data from nine televised Brexit debates spread across the 4 weeks leading up to the referendum. We analyse these causal maps to build one view on why Brexit happened. The maps are analysed for the breadth, depth and consistency of arguments in the debate and, broadly, finds that the Leave campaign focused more consistently on a smaller set of campaign themes, contributed more detail to those themes, and focused on their own core issues rather than being diverted onto Remain strongholds. In contrast, Remain shared more information but across a broader range of themes (meaning they were less consistent), and followed Leave into themes that were clearly not their core battleground. The novelties for soft OR in this paper include: the difficulties of building and validating causal maps from secondary data; new techniques for analysing a group of causal maps to uncover the properties of arguments that spread longitudinally through a campaign; a methodology for a teaching case using publicly availability data; linking the paper, philosophically, to critical realism given the unique dataset. Finally, we identify differences in the Leave and Remain debate campaigns to offer one answer to the question 'Why did Brexit happen?' (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Renewables and other non-fossil resources provide potential alternatives to diversify the electricity generation system. In this paper, various potential local non-fossil fuel resources, hydro, solar, wind, biomass and uranium are reviewed and an assessment framework for prioritizing these resources is established. A multi-criteria decision making approach, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based on expert opinion, is utilized for developing the assessment model, using four main criteria of technical, economic, social and environmental aspects and thirteen sub-criteria. The review reveal that Kazakhstan has ample potential to develop a non-fossil fuel based electricity system. Furthermore, the model shows hydro to be the most favorable resource followed by solar; wind and nuclear are ranked third and fourth, respectively while biomass is found to be the least attractive option. It is also found that each resource is inclined towards a particular criterion; hydro towards social, solar towards economic, nuclear towards technical, with biomass and wind directed towards environmental. Besides reporting the use of the AHP model for the first time in the Kazakhstan context, the assessment carried out in this paper can assist decision-makers to articulate long-term energy policy for any country.

In principle, we propose to analyse and refine each major hydrological process separately, sequentially, and iteratively. To test the method, the HYPE model concept (HYdrological Predictions for the Environment, originally developed for Sweden) was here applied to the data-sparse Niger River basin in West Africa. Errors in the baseline Niger-HYPE model were analysed to identify inadequately described processes. These process descriptions were subsequently isolated and refined through a set of experiments focusing on concept development, input data enhancement, and multivariable calibration. The refinements were guided by in situ discharge observations, earth observations, local expert knowledge, and previous studies. The results show that the original model concept could simulate the annual cycle of discharge, but not the magnitudes or daily dynamics (56-station average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency=-1). The main processes requiring improved descriptions were precipitation, evaporation, surface runoff, infiltration, soil storage, reservoir regulations, aquifer recharge, and flooding and river-atmosphere exchange in the Inner Niger Delta. Of these, evaporation, flooding and river-atmosphere exchange differ so much between Sweden and the Niger River that the model concept had to be refined. All refinements were synthesized in a new model version (Niger-HYPE2.0) performing significantly better across the basin (56-station average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency=0.4). This study demonstrates the danger of applying a model off the shelf, and the obligation to carefully evaluate and revise process descriptions when applying a model concept to a new region. Moreover, the results indicate that our approach to separately, sequentially, and iteratively refine processes together with local experts can substantially improve process-oriented hydrological models.;"[Andersson, Jafet C.

However, with more than 500 million tweets flowing per day, it is necessary to find efficient ways of collecting, storing, managing, mining and visualizing all this information. This is especially relevant if one considers that Twitter has no ways of indexing tweet contents, and that the only available categorization mechanism is the #hashtag, which is totally dependent of a user's will to use it. This paper presents an intelligent platform and framework, named MISNIS - Intelligent Mining of Public Social Networks' Influence in Society - that facilitates these issues and allows a non-technical user to easily mine a given topic from a very large tweet's corpus and obtain relevant contents and indicators such as user influence or sentiment analysis. When compared to other existent similar platforms, MISNIS is an expert system that includes specifically developed intelligent techniques that: (1) Circumvent the Twitter API restrictions that limit access to 1% of all flowing tweets. The platform has been able to collect more than 80% of all flowing portuguese language tweets in Portugal when online; (2) Intelligently retrieve most tweets related to a given topic even when the tweets do not contain the topic #hashtag or user indicated keywords. A 40% increase in the number of retrieved relevant tweets has been reported in real world case studies. The platform is currently focused on Portuguese language tweets posted in Portugal. However, most developed technologies are language independent (e.g. intelligent retrieval, sentiment analysis, etc.), and technically MISNIS can be easily expanded to cover other languages and locations.

The analysis of the ultrasonic data gathered from the pressure tubes is often a long and repetitive process on the critical path to the restart of the reactor. Motivations for developing an automated system include saving time on the critical path, minimising human subjectivity from the process and increasing repeatability of measurements. An automated system providing decision support to analysts also reduces the risk of operator fatigue by minimising time spent processing routine defects. This paper describes a novel system for the automated analysis of CANDU pressure tube inspection data. The system automates the entire initial examination process including the complex decision-making procedures by implementing an expert system with an associated rule-base. Results from this system are detailed, illustrating the location and characterisation of defects and key features within the pressure tube with a high degree of accuracy while increasing repeatability through the removal of subjectivity in measurements.;"[Lardner, Timothy; West, Graeme; Dobie, Gordon; Gachagan, Anthony] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, 204 George St, Glasgow G1 1XW, Lanark, Scotland";West, G (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, 204 George St, Glasgow G1 1XW, Lanark, Scotland.;graeme.west@strath.ac.uk;"Dobie, Gordon/AAC-5702-2020; West, Graeme/I-7914-2016";"Dobie, Gordon/0000-0003-3972-5917; West, Graeme/0000-0003-0884-6070";"Bruce Power; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/G038627/1] Funding Source: researchfish";The authors wish to thank Bruce Power for funding this work.

The FlowCAM (Flow Cytometer and Microscope) is an Imaging Flow Cytometry designed to obtain the particle concentration, images, and quantitative morphologic information. The objective in this paper is to establish the basis for transforming the FlowCAM from being a laboratory analyzer into a tool for systematic monitoring of ballast water. The capacity of the FlowCAM was evaluated by analyzing artificial microbeads, phytoplankton monocultures, and real seawater samples. Microbead analyses reported high accuracy and precision in size and concentration measurements. Monoculture analyses showed the effect of disinfection treatments in cell appearance and growth. Low concentration and heterogeneity of particles in real seawater analyses require the comprehensive observation of images by experts. Additionally, some physical characteristics of the device must be improved. The optimization of device configuration enables the quick transferring of files and information between parties involved in ballast water management. FlowCAM may become a feasible technology for this after the device and protocols are adapted. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These constraints can be based on religious believes, be due to food allergies or illnesses, or be derived from personal preferences or dislikes. For instance, preparing the menus at a hospital can be really complex. Another special situation arises when traveling abroad or simply when eating at a foreign cuisine restaurant (it is not always enough to know the brief description in the restaurant's menu or the explanation of the waiter). Therefore, we consider that it would be very interesting to develop a knowledge-based system that automatically obtained a personalized menu for each customer, according to the precise recipes of the restaurant and taking into account the data given by the customer and the ingredients out of stock (if any). Although there are many knowledge-based systems devoted to diabetic's meals, diets, food supply chains, etc., we do not know of any comparable system. We have developed a rule based expert system that uses sets and lists for handling data and an algebraic inference engine. It has been implemented in the computer algebra system Maple.

J;Williams, J;;;;Williams, Joanna;;;Lost in translation: Translating low carbon experiments into new spatial contexts viewed through the mobile-transitions lens;JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Low carbon experiments; Policy mobility; Sustainable urban transitions; Mobile transitions; Translation; Bedzed; Hammarby";"BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS; POLICY TRANSFER; URBAN; CHINA; PERSPECTIVE; POWER; CITY";"Low carbon urban transition experiments are emerging across cities globally. These experiments are socio-technical innovations with a high potential to contribute to a low carbon. Through the Global Intelligence Corps knowledge of these experiments is being disseminated across a variety of spatial contexts. Foreign cities are keen to replicate these examples of best practice; whilst technical experts, technology providers and governments are keen to export their expertise and technologies. However, the factors influencing the successful translation - movement, transformation and adaptation - of these experiments across spatial contexts requires deeper investigation. This paper explores the process using a mobile transitions conceptualisation. In this paper we develop a theoretical conceptualisation of the mobile transition process and test it using two low carbon experiments - Hammarby Sjostad (Stockholm) and BedZed (London). We identify the type of knowledge that is translatable (in the global form), and how this is modified both by the global and local assemblages throughout the process. The implication of our findings is that greater clarity is needed throughout the translation process if outcomes are to improve. Firstly, in order to determine the potential for an urban experiment to translate into a new spatial context the practitioner must understand the context from which it emerged and the context into which it will be translated. Secondly practitioners need to clearly define the translatable global form emerging from an experiment. It must be possible to decontextualise and re-contextualise the global form if it is to translate successfully. In some cases it may be impossible to decontextualise the global form without undermining the fundamental principles underlying the experiment. Thirdly, practitioners need to be aware of how the global form can be manipulated and re-represented by the global and local assemblages during the translation process. The global form is not fixed. Finally practitioners should be aware that new socio-technical systems (adopting the fundamental principles developed in the experiment) will emerge from the translation process. (C) 2017 The Author.

It has been shown that the classification of kidney stones can lead to an important reduction of the recurrence rate. The classification of kidney stones by human experts on the basis of certain visual color and texture features is one of the most employed techniques. However, the knowledge of how to analyze kidney stones is not widespread, and the experts learn only after being trained on a large number of samples of the different classes. In this paper we describe a new device specifically designed for capturing images of expelled kidney stones, and a method to learn and apply the experts knowledge with regard to their classification. We show that with off the shelf components, a carefully selected set of features and a state of the art classifier it is possible to automate this difficult task to a good degree. We report results on a collection of 454 kidney stones, achieving an overall accuracy of 63% for a set of eight classes covering almost all of the kidney stones taxonomy. Moreover, for more than 80% of samples the real class is the first or the second most probable class according to the system, being then the patient recommendations for the two top classes similar. This is the first attempt towards the automatic visual classification of kidney stones, and based on the current results we foresee better accuracies with the increase of the dataset size.

At the same time to promote strong diversity, the proposed algorithm imposes penalties (disadvantageous weights) to those attributes that participated in the latest tree in order to generate the subsequent trees. Besides, some other weight-related concerns are taken into account so that the trees generated by the proposed algorithm remain individually accurate and retain strong diversity. In order to show the worthiness of the proposed algorithm, we carry out experiments on 20 well known data sets that are publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is effective in generating highly accurate and more balanced decision forests compared to other prominent decision forest algorithms. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm is expected to be very effective in the domain of expert and intelligent systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To facilitate the daily use of safety checklists, computerized systems embedded in the clinical workflow and adapted to patient-context are increasingly developed. However, the current hard-coded approach of implementing checklists in these systems increase the cognitive efforts of clinical experts and coding efforts for informaticists. This is due to the lack of a formal representation format that is both understandable by clinical experts and executable by computer programs. Methods: We developed a dynamic checklist meta-model with a three-step approach. Dynamic checklist modeling requirements were extracted by performing a domain analysis. Then, existing modeling approaches and tools were investigated with the purpose of reusing these languages. Finally, the meta-model was developed by eliciting domain concepts and their hierarchies. The feasibility of using the meta-model was validated by two case studies. The meta-model was mapped to specific modeling languages according to the requirements of hospitals. Results: Using the proposed meta-model, a comprehensive coronary artery bypass graft peri-operative checklist set and a percutaneous coronary intervention peri-operative checklist set have been developed in a Dutch hospital and a Chinese hospital, respectively. The result shows that it is feasible to use the meta-model to facilitate the modeling and execution of dynamic checklists. Conclusions: We proposed a novel meta-model for the dynamic checklist with the purpose of facilitating creating dynamic checklists. The meta-model is a framework of reusing existing modeling languages and tools to model dynamic checklists. The feasibility of using the meta-model is validated by implementing a use case in the system.;"[Nan, Shan; Lu, Xudong; Kaymak, Uzay; Duan, Huilong] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Biomed Engn & Instrumental Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Nan, Shan; Van Gorp, Pieter; Lu, Xudong; Kaymak, Uzay; Korsten, Hendrikus] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Ind Engn, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Korsten, Hendrikus] Catharina Ziekenhuis Eindhoven, Anesthesiol & Intens Care, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Vdovjak, Richard] Philips Res Europe, Eindhoven, Netherlands";"Lu, XD (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Biomed Engn & Instrumental Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Lu, XD (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Ind Engn, Eindhoven, Netherlands.";lvxd@zju.edu.cn;"Nan, Shan/AAD-1486-2021; Kaymak, Uzay/A-3364-2008; Van Gorp, Pieter/L-9144-2013";"Nan, Shan/0000-0002-7807-3125; Kaymak, Uzay/0000-0002-4500-9098; Van Gorp, Pieter/0000-0001-5197-3986; Lu, Xudong/0000-0001-7658-5250";"Brain Bridge Project - Philips Research; Chinese National Science and Technology Major Project [2016YFC0901703]";The research leading to these results has received funding from the Brain Bridge Project sponsored by Philips Research and Chinese National Science and Technology Major Project (grant number 2016YFC0901703).;;37;7;7;0;6;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;;1472-6947;;BMC MED INFORM DECIS;BMC Med.

The management strategy differs between those with structural heart disease and those without. For the former, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is typically required due to an elevated risk for sudden cardiac death, and catheter ablation can be used as adjunctive therapy to treat or prevent repetitive ICD therapies. In contrast, VT or premature ventricular contractions in the setting of a structurally normal heart carries a low risk for sudden cardiac death; accordingly, there is typically no indication for an ICD. In these patients, catheter ablation is considered for symptom management or to treat tachycardiomyopathy and is potentially curative.

However, itappears that there is no scientific standard for validation of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs). In this paper, we present a novel combination of BBN validation approaches. A set of qualitative and quantitative validation approaches for the BBN structure, the Conditional Probability Tables and the BBN output is presented and discussed. The validation approaches were tested for a BBN on food provision under land use and land cover changes and different weather scenarios in rural northern Ghana. Experts played an important role in developing and validating the BBN due to data scarcity. Furthermore, selected nodes and the BBN output were compared to existing data. A sensitivity analysis was conducted. Validation approaches show that structural model uncertainties are still high and reliability of input data is low. However, the extreme-condition test shows that the BBN works according to the assumed system understanding that food provision decreases under floods, droughts, land pressure and poverty. Therefore, the BBN can provide general trends for output nodes but lacks reliability if detailed results of single system components are required. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: We examined 82 patients with early gastric cancer (EGC) diagnosed between April 2014 and August 2015. Five expert and 5 non-expert endoscopists retrospectively compared images obtained on non-magnifying BLI bright mode (BLI-BRT) and LCI with those obtained via conventional white light imaging (WLI). Interobserver agreement was also assessed. Results: In experts' evaluation of the images, an improvement in visibility was observed in 73% (60/82) and 20% (16/82) of cases under LCI and BLI-BRT, respectively. In non-experts' evaluation of the images, an improvement in visibility was observed in 76.8% (63/82) and 24.3% (20/82) of cases under LCI and BLI-BRT, respectively. There were no significant differences between experts and non-experts in the evaluation of the images. The improvement in visibility was significantly higher with LCI than with BLI-BRT in experts and non-experts (p < 0.01). With regard to tumor color on WLI, the improvement in the visibility of reddish and whitish tumors was significantly higher than that of isochromatic tumors when LCI was used. The improvement in visibility with LCI was observed in 71% (12/17) and 74% (48/65) of patients with and without Helicobacter pylori (Hp) eradication, respectively; no significant difference in improvement was observed between these groups. The interobserver agreement was good to satisfactory at >= 0.62. Conclusions: In Conclusion, our study showed that LCI improved the visibility of EGC, regardless of the level of endoscopists' experience or Hp eradication in patients, particularly for EGCs with a reddish or whitish color. The improvement in visibility was significantly higher with LCI than that with BLI.";"[Yoshifuku, Yoshikazu; Oka, Shiro; Kurihara, Mio; Mizumoto, Takeshi; Miwata, Tomohiro; Urabe, Yuji; Chayama, Kazuaki] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Dept Gastroenterol & Metab, Hiroshima, Japan; [Sanomura, Yoji; Tanaka, Shinji] Hiroshima Univ Hosp, Dept Endoscopy, Minami Ku, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Hiroshima 7348551, Japan; [Hiyama, Toru] Hiroshima Univ, Hlth Serv Ctr, Higashihiroshima, Japan";Sanomura, Y (corresponding author), Hiroshima Univ Hosp, Dept Endoscopy, Minami Ku, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Hiroshima 7348551, Japan.;y-sanomura@hiroshima-u.ac.jp;;;;;;29;23;26;2;5;BIOMED CENTRAL LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;1471-230X;;;BMC GASTROENTEROL;BMC Gastroenterol.;DEC 8;2017;17;;;;;;;;150;10.1186/s12876-017-0707-5;;;7;Gastroenterology & Hepatology;Gastroenterology & Hepatology;FP3ID;WOS:000417511000003;29216843;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-02-18;

For organizations, complexity arises when the procurement function is to purchase a massive amount of shredders of the same type. This study initiated the idea to use the analytic hierarchy process with graph theory and matrix approach for solving the problem. The proposed model determines the best shredder from a pool of alternatives, given the buyer-side decision-maker's preference settings. With the expert questionnaire polled and the heterogeneous real data collected, the model is applied to a reduced data set. The size of the decision problem is defined as 8 alternatives are filtered among 26, while the 7 justification attributes considered are fully kept for not losing the experimental meaning. The result shows the effectiveness and applicability of the approach to manage the encountered decision scientifically. As this also implies that not only buyers but also the manufacturers can use this model to analyse 'something', it is confident to conduct more future studies. The R script which implements the dynamic programming concept to calculate the assessed index scores for graph theory and matrix approach is perhaps another contribution of this study.;"[Zhuang, Zheng-Yun; Chiang, I-Jen] Taipei Med Univ, Coll Management, Grad Inst Data Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Su, Chia-Rong] Chang Gung Univ, Coll Management, Grad Inst Business & Management, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Chen, Chih-Yung] St Johns Univ, Coll Human Ecol & Design, Dept Multimedia Design, 499,Sec 4,Tam King Rd, New Taipei 25135, Taiwan";Chen, CY (corresponding author), St Johns Univ, Coll Human Ecol & Design, Dept Multimedia Design, 499,Sec 4,Tam King Rd, New Taipei 25135, Taiwan.;yung@mail.sju.edu.tw;Zhuang, Zheng-Yun/H-6132-2012;Zhuang, Zheng-Yun/0000-0002-8098-7495;"TMU Research Project, Taipei Medical University [TMU105-AE1-B46]; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (ROC)Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST106-2410-H-038-001]";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The funding supports of the study are disclosed as follows: TMU Research Project, Taipei Medical University: TMU105-AE1-B46 (received funds for covering the costs to publish in open access), Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (ROC): MOST106-2410-H-038-001.;;39;6;6;0;11;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1687-8140;;;ADV MECH ENG;Adv.

We aim to characterize the composition of the population of SO seekers, their reasons for seeking a SO and choosing a specific physician, and their perceived outcomes following the SO. Methods: A cross-sectional national telephone survey, using a representative sample of the general Israeli population (n = 848, response rate = 62%). SO utilization was defined as seeking an additional clinical opinion from a specialist within the same specialty, for the same medical concern. We describe the characteristics of respondents who obtained SOs, their reasons for doing so and their perceived outcomes: (1) Satisfaction with the SO; (2) Experiencing health improvement after receiving a SO; (3) A difference in the diagnosis or treatment suggested in the first opinions and the second opinions; (4) Preference of the SO over the first one. Results: Most of the respondents who sought a SO (n = 344) were above 60 years old, secular, living with a partner, perceived their income to be above average and their health status to be not so good. For the patients who utilized SOs, orthopedic surgeons were sought out more than any other medical professional. Reasons for seeking a SO included doubts about diagnosis or treatment (38%), search for a sub-specialty expert (19%) and dissatisfaction with communication (19%). SO seekers most frequently chose a specific specialist based on a recommendation from a friend or a relative (33%). About half of the SO seekers also searched for information on the internet. Most of the respondents who sought a SO mentioned that they were satisfied with it (84%), felt health improvement (77%), mentioned that there was a difference between the diagnosis or treatment between the first opinion and the SO (56%) and preferred the SO over the first one (91%). Conclusions: Clinical uncertainty or dissatisfaction with patient-physician communication were the main reasons for seeking a SO. Policy makers should be aware that many patients choose a physician for a SO based on recommendations made outside the medical system. We recommend creating mechanisms that help patients in the complicated process of seeking a SO, suggest specialists who are suitable for the specific medical problem of the patient, and provide tools to reconcile discrepant opinions.";"[Shmueli, Liora; Davidovitch, Nadav; Pliskin, Joseph S.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Hlth Syst Management, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Pliskin, Joseph S.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Ind Engn & Management, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Balicer, Ran D.] Clalit Hlth Serv, Clalit Res Inst, 101 Arlozorov, IL-62098 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Hekselman, Igal] Clalit Hlth Serv, Clalit Mushlam Hlth Insurance Syst, 1 Ben Gurion, IL-5120149 Bnei Braq, Israel; [Greenfield, Geva] Imperial Coll London, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Primary Care & Publ Hlth, Reynolds Bldg,St Dunstans Rd, London W6 8RP, England";Shmueli, L (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Hlth Syst Management, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.;liora.jana@gmail.com;;Pliskin, Joseph/0000-0002-1554-0371;Israel National Institute for Health Policy and Health Services Research (NIHP) [R/10/144];We gratefully acknowledge the support (Grant No R/10/144) from the Israel National Institute for Health Policy and Health Services Research (NIHP).;;54;10;10;0;5;BIOMED CENTRAL LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;2045-4015;;;ISR J HEALTH POLICY;Isr.

However, the ability to exploit reasoning on rating scale data is still limited. The objective of this work is to facilitate the integration of the semantics required to automatically interpret collections of standardized clinical data. We developed an electronic prototype for the Scale of the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), broadly used in neurology. In order to address the modeling challenges of the SARA, we propose to combine the best performances from OpenEHR clinical archetypes, guidelines and ontologies. Methods: A scaled-down version of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) was built, extracting the terms that describe the SARA tests from free-text sources. This version of the HPO was then used as backbone to normalize the content of the SARA through clinical archetypes. The knowledge required to exploit reasoning on the SARA data was modeled as separate information-processing units interconnected via the defined archetypes. Each unit used the most appropriate technology to formally represent the required knowledge. Results: Based on this approach, we implemented a prototype named SARA Management System, to be used for both the assessment of cerebellar syndrome and the production of a clinical synopsis. For validation purposes, we used recorded SARA data from 28 anonymous subjects affected by Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 36 (SCA36). When comparing the performance of our prototype with that of two independent experts, weighted kappa scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.86. Conclusions: The combination of archetypes, phenotype ontologies and electronic information-processing rules can be used to automate the extraction of relevant clinical knowledge from plain scores of rating scales. Our results reveal a substantial degree of agreement between the results achieved by an ontology-aware system and the human experts.;"[Maarouf, Haitham; Taboada, Maria; Rodriguez, Hadriana] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Elect & Comp Sci, Campus Vida, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Arias, Manuel; Sesar, Angel] Univ Hosp Santiago de Compostela, Dept Neurol, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Jesus Sobrido, Maria] Ctr Invest Biomd Red Enfermedades Raras CIBERER, IDIS, Santiago De Compostela, Spain";Taboada, M (corresponding author), Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Elect & Comp Sci, Campus Vida, Santiago De Compostela, Spain.;maria.taboada@usc.es;"Sesar, Angel/AAL-3199-2020; Taboada, Maria/Y-9449-2019";"Sesar, Angel/0000-0003-0511-0922; Arias, Manuel/0000-0002-4938-5402; Maarouf, Haitham/0000-0001-5370-9740; Taboada, Maria/0000-0002-2353-596X";"National Institute of Health Carlos III [FIS2012-PI12/00373: OntoNeurophen]; FEDER for national and European funding; PEACE II, Erasmus Mundus Lot 2 Project [2013-2443/001-001-EMA2]; Modern University for Business and Science (M.U.B.S)";"This work presented in this paper was supported by the National Institute of Health Carlos III [grant no.

Because of the large quantity of literature, a reliable automatic system to identify this information for future curation is essential. Such a system provides important and up to date data for database construction and updating, and even text summarization. In this paper we present a machine learning method to identify these genotype-phenotype relationships. No large human-annotated corpus of genotype-phenotype relationships currently exists. So, a semi-automatic approach has been used to annotate a small labelled training set and a self-training method is proposed to annotate more sentences and enlarge the training set. Results: The resulting machine-learned model was evaluated using a separate test set annotated by an expert. The results show that using only the small training set in a supervised learning method achieves good results (precision: 76.47, recall: 77.61, F-measure: 77.03) which are improved by applying a self-training method (precision: 77.70, recall: 77.84, F-measure: 77.77). Conclusions: Relationships between genotypes and phenotypes is biomedical information pivotal to the understanding of a patient's situation. Our proposed method is the first attempt to make a specialized system to identify genotype-phenotype relationships in biomedical literature. We achieve good results using a small training set. To improve the results other linguistic contexts need to be explored and an appropriately enlarged training set is required.;"[Khordad, Maryam; Mercer, Robert E.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Comp Sci, 1151 Richmond St, London N6A 5B7, England";Khordad, M (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Comp Sci, 1151 Richmond St, London N6A 5B7, England.;mkhordad@alumni.uwo.ca;;;Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC);Support for this work was provided through a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant to Robert E.

In the search for new modeling paradigms, we expect ontologies to play a big role. One of the critical challenges we face is the scarcity of semantically rich, properly populated, ontologies in most application domains in chemical and materials engineering. Developing such ontologies is a very challenging task requiring considerable investment in time, effort, and expert knowledge. One needs automation tools that can assist an ontology engineer to quickly develop and curate domain-specific ontologies. We consider our conceptual framework in this paper, a general approach for populating scientific ontologies, and its implementation as the prototype HOLMES, as an early attempt towards such an automated knowledge management environment. Our approach integrates a variety of machine learning and natural language processing methods to extract information from journal articles and store them semantically in an ontology. In this work, identification of key terms (such as chemicals, drugs, processes, anatomical entities, etc.) from abstracts, and the classification of these terms into 25 classes are presented. Two methods, a multi-class classifier (SVM) and a multi-label classifier (HOMER), were tested on an annotated data set for the pharmaceutical industry. The test was done using two different versions of the same data set, one using the BIO notation and the other not. The F1 scores for HOMER, were better in the BIO notation (63.6% vs 48.5%) while SVM performed better in the non-BIO version (54.1% vs 53.2%). However, the standard metrics did not consider the effect of the multiple answers that the multi-label classifier is allowed to obtain. As the results of our computational experiments show, while the performance of multi-label classifier is encouraging, much more remains to be done in order to develop a practically viable automated ontology-based knowledge management system.

High-quality maternal health care is necessary to address this burden. Implementation of WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist (SCC), whose items address the major causes of maternal deaths, is hypothesized to improve adherence of providers to essential childbirth practices. Method: The SCC was adapted for the local context through expert consultation meetings, creating a total of 27 checklist items. This study was a pre-post evaluation of SCC implementation. Data were collected over 8 months at Magura District Hospital. We analysed 468 direct observations of birth (main analysis using 310 complete observations and sensitivity analysis with the additional 158 incomplete observations) from admission to discharge. The primary outcome of interest was the number of essential childbirth practices performed before compared to after SCC implementation. The change was assessed using adjusted Poisson regression models accounting for clustering by nurse-midwives. Result: After checklist introduction, significant improvements were observed: on average, around 70% more of these safe childbirth practices were performed in the follow-up period compared to baseline (from 11 to 19 out of 27 practices). Substantial increases were seen in communication between nurse-midwives and mothers (counselling), and in management of complications (including rational use of medicines). In multivariable models that included characteristics of the mothers and of the nurse-midwives, the rate of delivering the essential childbirth practices was 1.71 times greater in the follow-up compared to baseline (95% CI 1.61-1.81). Conclusion: Implementation of SCC has the potential to improve essential childbirth practice in resource-poor settings like Bangladesh. This study emphasizes the need for health system strengthening in order to achieve the full advantages of SCC implementation.;"[Nababan, Herfina Y.; Islam, Rubana; Tariqujjaman, Md] Int Ctr Diarrhoeal Dis Res, Hlth Syst & Populat Studies Div, Ctr Universal Hlth Coverage, 68 Shahid Tajuddin Ahmed Sharani, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh; [Nababan, Herfina Y.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Nossal Inst Global Hlth, 333 Exhibit St, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Islam, Rubana] Univ New South Wales, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Fac Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Mostari, Shabnam; Sarker, Malabika] BRAC Univ, James P Grant Sch Publ Hlth, 68 Shahid Tajuddin Ahmed Sharani, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh; [Islam, Mohammad Tajul] JICA, 3rd Floor,57 Gulshan Ave,CWS A19,Gulshan 1, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh; [Moucheraud, Corrina] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 650 Charles E Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA";"Nababan, HY (corresponding author), Int Ctr Diarrhoeal Dis Res, Hlth Syst & Populat Studies Div, Ctr Universal Hlth Coverage, 68 Shahid Tajuddin Ahmed Sharani, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh.; Nababan, HY (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Nossal Inst Global Hlth, 333 Exhibit St, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia.";herfina.nababan@gmail.com;"Tariqujjaman/ABG-4290-2020; Islam, Rubana/I-7331-2019";"Tariqujjaman/0000-0002-0172-9501; Islam, Rubana/0000-0002-9538-5390; Nababan, Herfina/0000-0002-7818-4132";Maternal Health Task Force (MHTF) through icddr,b;This study is supported by Maternal Health Task Force (MHTF) through icddr,b.

We investigated the levels of trust that consumers place in different information sources and how trust is associated with cultural worldviews, risk perceptions, ENDS use, and sociodemographic characteristics using a nationally representative sample of 6051 U.S. adults in 2015. Seventeen percent of adults were uncertain about their trust for one or more potential sources. Among the rest, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), health experts, and the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) elicited the highest levels of trust. In contrast, tobacco and vapor manufacturers, vape shop employees, and, to a lesser extent, the news media were distrusted. Adults who had higher incomes and more education or espoused egalitarian and communitarian worldviews expressed more trust in health sources and the FDA, whereas those identifying as non-Hispanic Black or multiracial reported less trust. Current smokers, those who identified as non-Hispanic Black or other race, had lower incomes, and espoused hierarchy and individualism worldviews expressed less distrust toward the tobacco and vapor industry. Greater trust (or less distrust) toward the tobacco and vapor industry and an individualism worldview were associated with perceptions of lower risk of premature death from daily ENDS use, greater uncertainty about those risks, and greater odds of using ENDS. Public health and the FDA should consider consumer trust and worldviews in the design and regulation of public education campaigns regarding the potential health risks and benefits of ENDS.;"[Weaver, Scott R.; Jazwa, Amelia; Popova, Lucy; Rothenberg, Richard B.; Eriksen, Michael P.] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Slovic, Paul] Decis Res, Eugene, OR USA; [Slovic, Paul] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA";Weaver, SR (corresponding author), Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol & Biostat, POB 3995, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.;srweaver@gsu.edu;;;"National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIH/NIDA) [P50DA036128]; Food and Drug Administration, Center for Tobacco Products (FDA CTP); National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NIH/NCI)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [R00CA187640]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [R00CA187460, R00CA187460, R00CA187460] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128, P50DA036128] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";Research reported in this publication was supported by grant number P50DA036128 from the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIH/NIDA) and Food and Drug Administration, Center for Tobacco Products (FDA CTP) and by grant number R00CA187640 from the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NIH/NCI) and Food and Drug Administration, Center for Tobacco Products (FDA CTP).

The attention is paid to the forms of its realization - prevention of offences (a preventive sub function) and separate types of administrative procedures, which are characterized by a protective directionality. When writing the article, the author examined the content of a protective function of administrative law, revealed its elements and ascertained the mechanism of its interaction with a regulatory function. The analysis of preventive activity as forms of realization of guarding function of administrative law is carried out. The place of administrative and procedural production in the system of other procedural regulators is specified; need for adoption of the Federal Law About Administrative Procedure is proved; administrative procedures in the context of realization of guarding function of administrative law are analyzed. The author used the following methods: system analysis, dialectic, logic, a comparative legal method, analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction. The research resulted in the following conclusions: - preventive measures must be based on the formation of the need for lawful behavior on the part of subjects, their internal assurance in need to observe current legislation and intolerance to its violations and the conditions which provide them; - the main way of formation of persuasion is the creation and realization of educational mechanism and appropriate means of educational impact on consciousness, views and feelings of citizens at all stages of formation of the personality (the kernel of a preventive mechanism); - it is necessary to reduce the system of preventive legislation and related normative legal acts to a common denominator, having eliminated contradictory provisions, atypical definitions and other shortcomings. The Federal Law About Bases of System of Prevention of Offences in the Russian Federation has to act as the backbone legal document. - administrative procedures of positive contents are characterized by a pronounced protective orientation, they participate in the realization of a protective function of administrative law, playing a securing role; - control and supervising procedure is directed at the prevention, identification and suppression of offenses that emphasizes its securing content; - expert and certifying administrative procedures illustrate a guarding orientation of administrative procedures in the context of ensuring environmental protection.";[Vedyashkin, Sergey V.] Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia;Vedyashkin, SV (corresponding author), Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia.;;Vedyashkin, Sergey/O-8323-2014;;;;;13;1;1;0;1;TOMSK STATE UNIV;TOMSK;LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;2225-3513;2311-3693;;VESTN TOSK GOS U-PR;Vestn.

Since the technical valuation of a patent is calculated according to the opinion of experts, it is costly and time consuming, and hence, the quality of the patent is judged based on subjective opinions of non-experts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an objective and rational evaluation system for the qualitative level of patents. In this paper, we classify the valuation of patents into technicality, rights, and usability, and consider the quantitative and objective evaluation modeling of patents using Bayesian structural equation model. In particular, based on the data collected by the Korea Invention Promotion Association, we apply the Bayesian approach, which is capable of stable modeling even under small samples by using prior information, and the structural equation model, which is excellent for modeling and evaluating qualitative performance that is difficult to measure directly, to develop a patent evaluation model.;"[Woo, Ho-young; Lim, Changwon] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Appl Stat, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea; [Kwak, Jungae] Korea Invent Promot Assoc, Seoul, South Korea";Lim, C (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Dept Appl Stat, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea.;clim@cau.ac.kr;;;;;;29;2;2;2;10;KOREAN STATISTICAL SOC;SEOUL;SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, BLDG RM 709, 635-4 YEOGSAM-DONG, KANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-703, SOUTH KOREA;1225-066X;2383-5818;;KOREAN J APPL STAT;Korean J.

PTCLs are highly diverse, reflecting the diverse cells from which they can originate and are currently sub-classified usingWorld Health Organization (WHO) 2008 criteria. In 2006 the International T-Cell Lymphoma Project launched the T-Cell Project, building on the retrospective study previously carried on by the network, with the aim to prospectively collect accurate data to improve knowledge on this group of lymphomas. Based on previously published reports from International Study Groups it emerged that rendering a correct classification of PTCLs is quite difficult because the relatively low prevalence of these diseases results in a lack of confidence by most pathologists. This is the reason why the T-Cell Project requested the availability of diagnostic material from the initial biopsy of each patient registered in the study in order to have the initial diagnosis centrally reviewed by expert hematopathologists. In the present report the results of the review process performed on 573 cases are presented. Overall, an incorrect diagnosis was centrally recorded in 13.1% cases, including 8.5% cases centrally reclassified with a subtype eligible for the project and 4.6% cases misclassified and found to be disorders other than T-cell lymphomas; 2.1% cases were centrally classified as T-Cell disorders not included in the study population. Thus, the T-Cell Project confirmed the difficulties in providing an accurate classification when a diagnosis of PTCLs is suspected, singled out the major pitfalls that can bias a correct histologic categorization and confirmed that a centralized expert review with the application of adequate diagnostic algorithms is mandatory when dealing with these tumours.

Generally, Balinese tourism attractions are more concerned on unique natural environment and culture, but a mass tourism industry develop rapidly in Bali and inevitably get alarming environmental and culture degradation issues. A green tourism concept becomes very urgent to be introduced in order to mitigate some negative effects of the mass tourism development. The green concept is not only concern to the environmental friendly concept but also the local people benefit consideration. The study was carried out with both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Site survey (observation), questionnaire and supporting data from the relevant literatures are used for data collection and the next step the model will be validated by an expert. The results showed that model developed should be integrated from the green components including, natural material, green local food, waste management, water source conservation, local eco-agriculture system, renewable energies, and green transportation. The integrated green components should be supporting by the local government regulation and also funding, local indigenous culture, and green behavior of the local people. The model will be eligible to be implemented, since it was accepted very well by local people, and overseas tourists. The beneficial value from the green implementation also seems positive. The existing local regulation rule also shows strong relationship with the green concept. But, the green knowledge of the local people still need to be improved.;"[Santosa, I. Dewa M.

Eight basic aspects of agricultural education can be identified in the historical literature available, while a ninth aspect the teacher centered lecture can be defined as being the reason for starting the modern system of agricultural vocational schools due to its perceived lack of suitability in education farmers. Taking the data into account, agricultural education was mostly focused on the concept of problem-based and active learning concepts. This was further added by out of school learning, cognitive learning, and learning in groups. Experiments, expert interviews, and the use of literature can be taken as essential for educational processes in this vocational field. Taking these into account, we find a close similarity with modern macro methods like Forest Case Studies and Animal Case Studies, pointing out the specific suitability of these methods and concepts.;[Hepper, Jens] BBS II Northeim, Sudheimer Str 24, D-37154 Northeim, Germany;Hepper, J (corresponding author), BBS II Northeim, Sudheimer Str 24, D-37154 Northeim, Germany.;jens.hepper@bbs2-northeim.de;;;;;;104;0;0;1;6;JOHANN HEINRICH VON THUNEN INST-VTI;BRAUNSCHWEIG;BUNDESALLEE 50, BRAUNSCHWEIG, 38116, GERMANY;0458-6859;;;LANDBAUFORSCHUNG-GER;Landbauforschung;DEC;2017;67;3-4;;;;;111;121;;10.3220/LBF1509962715000;;;11;Agriculture, Multidisciplinary;Agriculture;GE8IE;WOS:000431474600001;;;;;2021-02-18;

The species were classified according to the existing literature and experts' judgment, as established, casual, invasive and expected. Finally, factsheets were compiled for ten species of high importance based on their expanding/invading character. Of the 160 species comprising the list, 149 were already present in the ESENIAS countries, while eleven were invasive species either present in the Mediterranean or in other European Seas, likely to be recorded in the ESENIAS countries. The majority of the species were of Red Sea/Indo-Pacific origin (97 species; 60.6%). Italy, Turkey and Greece were the countries with the highest representation of species (159, 152 and 139 species respectively), due to their extended coastline and the number of scholars working on marine invasive species. The highest number of established species was recorded in Turkey (116 species), whereas in Italy and Greece the most numerous species were the expected ones (85 and 48 species, respectively). The eastern Adriatic Sea countries (i.e. Albania, Croatia, Montenegro and Slovenia) had generally low numbers of species in this list, many of which are still expected to arrive from the neighbouring countries of Greece and Italy. Finally, the most frequently potential pathway was transfer stowaways (ship ballast water: 41 cases; ship hull fouling: 55), whereas unaided spread of Lessepsian immigrants followed (95 cases).

The second method uses particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique and it is based on a detailed cost equation with all design variables. In both the methods, sizing of PV array is attempted after an appropriate time shifting of loads. It has been established that such alteration of the time of consumption brings down the cost of storage system. The complete procedure for the optimal sizing of DC Nano-grid system by both the methods has been demonstrated for a locality in India. It has been established that sizing of the PV array using intuitive method is adequate for designing a DC Nano-grid in a rural area. (C) 2017 Karabuk University.

The expenditure data based on the defined categories through the public rates published in the ports' tariff documents were collected and used as inputs in the system. Conversion factors were developed to standardize port tariffs and expenditure profiles based on the common knowledge of the literature and expert's justification. Case studies provided were to re-examine and verify as the sensitivity analysis to simulate economic impacts based on changes to cargo flows using tariff data in the spending profiles. Compared to the traditional survey approach, we found that using tariff data in place of traditional surveys provides a time-effective way to capture and update port characteristics, business structure and flows, as well as to extract detail information that is otherwise neglected for economic impact analysis.;"[Wang, Grace] Texas A&M Univ, Galveston, TX 77554 USA; [Chang, Wen-Huei] US Army Corp Engineers, Washington, DC USA; [Cui, Yue] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA";Wang, G (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Galveston, TX 77554 USA.;wangw@tamug.edu;;;;;;22;0;0;0;3;FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE;PISA;PO BOX  NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY;0391-8440;;;INT J TRANSP ECON;Int.

Scholars and practitioners alike are adopting UAVs to study ecological phenomena and contribute to natural resource management decision-making processes. But while UAVs have been readily adopted in the global north their movement into spaces where resource management decision-making processes can benefit from the aerial perspective has not kept pace. In this paper, we describe the process we followed to introduce UAVs to two Amerindian communities in the North Rupununi, Guyana. Following consultations on the benefits and potential dangers associated with UAV operation, we successfully built and flew UAVs over swidden agriculture plots of various ages with indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples suggested that UAVs can be important tools in their natural resource management efforts and in planning for long-term food security. We suggest that scholars willing to embrace and respect indigenous culture, regulatory guidelines, and customary norms, can build mutualistic relationships with indigenous peoples to introduce technology. The adoption of UAVs by indigenous people can lead to potential global-level benefits, including their involvement in monitoring above-ground biomass and carbon sequestration potential on their lands, rather than importing experts to complete these tasks.;"[Cummings, Anthony R.] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Geospatial Informat Sci, 800 W Cambell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Cummings, Garvin R.; Hamer, Esan] Minist Agr, Hydrometeorol Serv, 18 Brickdam, Georgetown, Guyana";Cummings, AR (corresponding author), Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Geospatial Informat Sci, 800 W Cambell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.;anthony.cummings@utdallas.edu;;;School of Economic, Political and Policy Science (EPPS) Advisory Council;This work could not have been possible without a grant from the School of Economic, Political and Policy Science (EPPS) Advisory Council.

Along with classical approaches to structural and functional construction of geoinformation systems of GIS analysis and monitoring of environmental risks, a new approach to the organization of the process of analysis and monitoring of environmental risks in conditions of fuzziness is considered. The approach is based on applying modern theory and practice of risk analysis and monitoring in complex software projects. In the proposed approach, the process of analyzing and monitoring environmental risks in the GIS includes an algorithm consisting of the following steps: identification of environmental risks; a qualitative analysis of environmental risks; quantitative analysis of environmental risks; planning of response to environmental risks; monitoring and risk management. An important step of this algorithm is a qualitative analysis of environmental risks, performed by expert methods. As a result of this analysis, experts form a ranked register of environmental risks, which are grouped by category. The established register of environmental risks is the basis for the following stages of the algorithm for system analysis and monitoring of environmental risks. At the same time, the process of qualitative analysis of environmental risks is a very laborious process. To formalize this process, it is proposed to use modern methods to support the adoption of expert decisions in conditions of fuzziness. In this connection, the article considers the approach to presenting fuzzy product rules in a fuzzy production GIS designed for the analysis and monitoring of environmental risks. Existing fuzzy decision-making decision support systems by definition are designed to implement the process of fuzzy inference and serve as a conceptual basis for modern fuzzy logic. The achieved successes in the application of these systems for solving a wide class of control tasks and served as the basis for choosing a mathematical apparatus for formalizing the process of analysis and reducing environmental risks based on the use of models, methods and algorithms of fuzzy sets theory and fuzzy Petri nets. Within the framework of the proposed formalized approach to risk analysis, NSPs obtained as a result of the introduction of fuzziness in the initial marking and in the rules for triggering the transitions of the basic formalism of ordinary JVs are considered. The considered system analysis of the NSP allows us to concretize the proposed way of presenting the rules of fuzzy products in solving applied problems of fuzzy modeling and performing the process of approximate reasoning on environmental risks. Based on the use of modified NSPs, a pilot version of an automated decision support system for environmental risks can be developed. This system is essentially an expert system that reflects the fuzzy logic of the interrelation of input values-expert assessments of the state of the region's ecology and output values-the degrees of truth of possible environmental risks. The main functional modules of such an automated system should be considered: a base of rules for fuzzy products, a block of fuzzy logic inference, an interface module, a rule base modification module, modules for fuzzification and defuzzification. The user interface of the automated system should be based on the representation of all system objects and functions available to the user in the form of graphic components of the screen. To formalize the process of environmental risk analysis, the paper proposes a way to present fuzzy product rules in a fuzzy environmental risk analysis system based on the use of fuzzy Petri nets. A program implementation of a fuzzy production system for the analysis of environmental risks based on the use of modified fuzzy Petri nets was implemented. The software product has a sufficiently effective application for solving problems in the GIS of environmental monitoring. The modern theory and practice of GIS development for the analysis and monitoring of environmental risks in conditions of diverse initial geodata indicates the need to develop new effective approaches and algorithms for supporting decision-making on environmental risks in conditions of fuzziness. As a result of the software implementation of the algorithm for analyzing environmental risks using the mathematical apparatus of the NRS, an effective and easy-to-use software product has been developed that is intended for application in practice both independently and as part of industrial GIS.";"[Natalia, Akinina, V; Vladimir, Psoyants G.; Aleksandr, Kolesenkov N.; Aleksandr, Taganov, I] Ryazan State Radio Engn Univ, Ryazan, Russia";Natalia, VA (corresponding author), Ryazan State Radio Engn Univ, Ryazan, Russia.;natalya.akinina@gmail.com;;;;;;16;0;0;0;3;TOMSK STATE UNIV;TOMSK;LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;1947-8488;1947-8496;;VESTN TOMSK GOS U-UP;Int.

A variety of methods have been developed to characterize the metabolic state of the cell by determining its intracellular flux distribution, and together, they are called metabolic flux analysis (MFA) or fluxomics. These methods, in addition to other X-omics technologies (i.e., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) constitute a recent arsenal of the system biology estimation approaches. One of the most well-developed approaches for intracellular carbon flux estimation in vivo in (quasi) steady-state conditions is C-13-MFA, which uses substrates that are labeled with a heavy carbon (C-13). Applying C-13-MFA requires the coordination of experts in biochemistry, applied mathematics and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or mass spectrometry. Therefore, the authors have prepared a three-part review highlighting the different but equally important aspects of C-13-MFA. In the first part, which is presented below, the focus is on the basic principles of C-13-MFA, such as stoichiometric model development, labeling experiments and experimental data extraction. The principles of the labeling experiments modeling and quantitative carbon flux estimation and statistics are discussed in the second part.

Using GTA missions, interdependencies between systems, and individual system components are modeled together as a collection of abstract and physical system components that form a directed graph system diagram. The component relationships defined in the diagram model is used to structure trace algorithm based analysis and data management. In the example, load priorities are assigned using system traces that propagate priorities from mission objects down through the system to individual fluid and electrical system loads. Resulting load priority assignments are then used by a separate algorithm to perform reconfiguration analysis, which in turn uses power and fluid flow analysis to check system operation constraints. The paper also discusses other interdependent system analysis approaches that can be found in the literature that address the use of load priority information. Load priority assignment is typically done using detailed scenarios and expert knowledge. This is then used to generate load priority data sets that are defined specifically for each individual operation condition to be analyzed, and then stored for use in follow-on analysis. For complex problems involving large numbers of prioritized loads, damage to multiple areas, and changing mission priorities, load priority assignment is difficult to perform. The goal of this paper is to help further define the load priority data management and reconfiguration analysis problem, and to also present new ideas for load priority dependent analysis solutions that fit well with standard system operation management procedures.;"[Russell, Kevin J.] Elect Distribut Design Inc EDD, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA; [Russell, Kevin J.] Wyoming Area Off, Engn Branch, Mills, WY 82644 USA; [Russell, Kevin J.] US Bur Reclamat, Washington, DC 20240 USA; [Russell, Kevin J.] ASNE, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Russell, Kevin J.] IEEE, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA; [Broadwater, Robert P.] Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA";"Russell, KJ (corresponding author), Elect Distribut Design Inc EDD, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA.; Russell, KJ (corresponding author), Wyoming Area Off, Engn Branch, Mills, WY 82644 USA.; Russell, KJ (corresponding author), US Bur Reclamat, Washington, DC 20240 USA.; Russell, KJ (corresponding author), ASNE, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.; Russell, KJ (corresponding author), IEEE, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.";;;;;;;20;1;1;0;2;AMER SOC NAVAL ENG INC;ALEXANDRIA;1452 DUKE STREET, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-3458 USA;0028-1425;1559-3584;;NAV ENG J;Nav.

Almost ten years after the beginning of the crisis, we can state that only now new technological solutions have emerged (NBIC technologies, Industry 4.0, the Internet of things, industrial systems using elements of artificial intelligence) that can give new impetus to the development of the world economy. However, the dynamics of economic development of many industrialized countries can significantly slow down if the problems of the accelerating income gap between the most and the least well-off strata of the population are not solved. In this paper it is shown that exceeding the critical thresholds of inequality indicators (Gini index) leads to significant slowdowns in economic growth rates. Calculations carried out on the basis of production and institutional functions for industrialized countries show that the GDP losses associated with the actual values of the inequality indices exceeding their optimal values range from 0.5 to 1.9 percent. The Gini index values below their optimal values also lead to GDP losses, for example for Scandinavian countries such losses range from 0.6 to 3.7 percent. Dynamic optimization of GDP output has a significant effect, substantially increasing the potential volumes of its production.;"[Akaev, Askar A.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, 1 Leninskie Gory,GSP 1, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Sarygulov, Askar I.] St Petersburg State Univ Architecture & Civil Eng, 4,2 Ya Krasnoarmeyskaya Ul, St Petersburg 190005, Russia; [Sokolov, Valentin N.] St Petersburg State Univ Econ, 27 Ul Marata, St Petersburg 191002, Russia";Akaev, AA (corresponding author), Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, 1 Leninskie Gory,GSP 1, Moscow 119991, Russia.;"askarakaev@mail.ru; asarygulov@lan.spbgasu.ru; svn@engec.ru";"Sarygulov, Askar/D-7422-2019; Sokolov, Valentin/D-8711-2019; Akaev, Askar/M-9560-2013";"Sarygulov, Askar/0000-0002-8165-0122; Sokolov, Valentin/0000-0002-4723-044X; ";;;;14;0;0;0;6;EKONOMICESKAA POLITIKA;MOSCOW;EKONOMICESKAA POLITIKA, MOSCOW, 00000, RUSSIA;1994-5124;2411-2658;;EKONOMICHESKAYA POLI;EKONOMICHESKAYA POLIT.;DEC;2017;12;6;;;;;8;23;;10.18288/1994-5124-2017-6-01;;;16;Economics;Business & Economics;FX9EF;WOS:000426397900001;;Bronze;;;2021-02-18;

This paper presents the features of a system for the collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of data regarding the health status of pets in the Veneto region (Italy). The system involved the construction of a Web-based database containing the diagnoses of transmissible and non-transmissible diseases of dogs and cats made by veterinarians in their practices, hospitals, kennels and catteries. Each diagnosis constitutes a single record, also containing data on the identification of the individual animal and on several characteristics of epidemiological relevance. The World Health Organization (WHO) 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) for human diseases has been adapted to canine and feline diseases to standardise the diagnostic nomenclature. Software has been specifically created for online data entry and data management. The first results show that the main disorders were digestive (21%), dermatological (18%) and cardiovascular (11%) among 1,087 diagnostic records in dogs, and digestive (23%), dermatological (15%) and urinary (14%) among 289 diagnostic records in cats. The main causes of death are represented by cardiovascular (21%) and gastrointestinal (21%) diseases in dogs and by urinary (31%) disorders in cats.

Plamondon and C. Ouellet-Plamondon, in On Recent Developments in Theoretical and Experimental General Relativity, Astrophysics, and Relativistic Field Theories, edited by K. Rosquist, R. T. Jantzen, and R. Ruffini (World Scientific, Singapore, 2015), p. 1301] for studying the space-time geometry of a static symmetric massive object. This metric depends on a complementary error function (erfc) potential that characterizes the emergent gravitation field predicted by the model. This results in two types of deviations as compared to computations made on the basis of a Newtonian potential: a constant and a radial outcome. One key feature of the metric is that it postulates the existence of an intrinsic physical constant r, the massive object-specific proper length that scales measurements in its surroundings. Although r must be evaluated experimentally, we use a heuristic to estimate its value and point out some latent relationships between the Hubble constant, the secular increase in the astronomical unit, and the Pioneers delay. Indeed, highlighting the systematic errors that emerge when the effect of sigma is neglected, one can link the Hubble constant H-0 to rSun and the secular increase V-AU to sigma(Earth). The accuracy of the resulting numerical predictions, H-0 = 74.42(0.02) (km/s)/Mpc and V-AU congruent to 7: 8 cmyr(-1), calls for more investigations of this new metric by specific experts. Moreover, we investigate the expected impacts of the new metric on the flyby anomalies, and we revisit the Pioneers delay. It is shown that both phenomena could be partly taken into account within the context of this unifying paradigm, with quite accurate numerical predictions.

The solution of this problem is influenced by a large number of various factors, but one of the most important is the correct choice of supplier. The paper considers mathematical multi-criteria methods of supplier choice; in particular, the methods SAW, TOPSIS, ELECTRA, and AHP. A conditional example of supplier choice by these methods is presented and considered, on the basis of which a comparative analysis of methods is carried out, their advantages, disadvantages and specific features are revealed. Based on the results of the analysis of these methods, conclusions are drawn that: the results of calculations by the methods presented may not coincide; all methods are sufficiently universal, but differ significantly in the complexity of the calculations; the methods considered are subjective, since they are based on expert assessments; the choice of the supplier evaluation method should be based on an analysis of a number of factors (planned labor intensity of research, planned amount of research funding, availability of qualified researchers, and quality of expert assessments).

It means to judge the extent to which certain weather-related extreme events have changed due to human influences on climate with probabilistic statements. Extreme Event Attribution is often anticipated to spur more than just scientific ambition. It is able to provide answers to a commonly asked questions after extreme events, namely, `can we blame it on climate change' and is assumed to support decision- making of various actors engaged in climate change mitigation and adaptation. More in-depth research is widely lacking about who these actors are; in which context they can make use of it; and what requirements they have, to be able to actually apply Extreme Event Attribution. We have therefore addressed these questions with two empirical case studies looking at regional decision- makers who deal with storm surge risks in the German Baltic Sea region and heat waves in the Greater Paris area. Stakeholder interviews and workshops reveal that fields of application and requirements are diverse, difficult to explicitly identify, and often clearly associated with stakeholders' specific mandate, the hazard background, and the regional socio-economic setting. Among the considered stakeholders in the Baltic Sea region, Extreme Event Attribution is perceived to be most useful to awareness-raising, in particular for climate change mitigation. They emphasised the importance of receiving understandable information - and that, rather later, but with smaller uncertainties than faster, but with higher uncertainties. In the Paris case, we typically talked to people engaged in adaptation with expertise in terms of climate science, but narrowly defined mandates which is typical for the Paris-centred political system with highly specialised public experts. The interviewees claimed that Extreme Event Attribution is most useful to political leverage and public discourses. If novel information like this is not sorted out a priori, it needs to be clearly linked to impacts, preferably as monetary values lost. These examples underline the significance of conducting case-specific stakeholder mappings and consultation. Overall, our studies can thereby provide methods and exemplary empirical evidence to support developing useful services from Extreme Event Attribution for targeted groups of users.";"[Schwab, Maria; Meinke, Insa; von Storch, Hans] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Vanderlinden, Jean-Paul] Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, Versailles, France";Schwab, M (corresponding author), Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany.;maria.schwab@hzg.de;"Vanderlinden, Jean-Paul/Y-8421-2019; von Storch, Hans/J-4165-2012";von Storch, Hans/0000-0002-5825-8069;EUCLEIA (EUropean Climate and weather Events: Interpretation and Attribution) project under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme[FP7] [607085];The research leading to these results has received funding under the EUCLEIA (EUropean Climate and weather Events: Interpretation and Attribution) project under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme[FP7/2007-2013] under grant agreement no 607085.

Several changes in the Human Machine Interface (HMI) of the tractor cab have been introduced to accommodate this technology. HMIs arc known to raise issues about their ease of use; however, this topic has been under-investigated in the agricultural sector. The present study introduces a method to investigate the perceived ease of use of the HMI of agricultural tractors equipped with technological innovations. The HMI required to manage a CVT tractor was evaluated by sixteen tractor drivers (8 novices and 8 experts). During the first contact with the machine and after having performed two targeted tasks with the tractor, participants filled in a questionnaire about the ease of use of the controls and of the touch-screen display, and evaluated the general perception of ease of use, safety, quality and solidity of the machine. The trial pointed out some significant differences between novices and experts, thus confirming the validity of the proposed method. In particular, novice users showed some difficulties when interacting for the first time with the HMI of the CVT tractor working station, whereas experts did not report similar difficulties. Thus, expertise seems to play a role in determining the quality of the interaction with the HMI. Training interventions should be designed to help novices in increasing their expertise effectively, avoiding effort and errors and improving user's comfort and system performance.";"[Caffaro, Federica; Cavallo, Eugenio] Natl Res Council Italy CNR, Inst Agr & Earthmoving Machines IMAMOTER, Str Cacce 73, I-10135 Turin, Italy; [Bisaglia, Carlo; Cutini, Maurizio] CREA, Res Ctr Engn & Agrofood Proc, Via Milano 43, I-24047 Treviglio, Italy; [Micheletti Cremasco, Margherita] Univ Torino, Dept Life Sci & Syst Biol, Via Accademia Albertina 13, I-10123 Turin, Italy";Cavallo, E (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Italy CNR, Inst Agr & Earthmoving Machines IMAMOTER, Str Cacce 73, I-10135 Turin, Italy.;eugenio.cavallo@cnr.it;"Cavallo, Eugenio/F-2820-2014; Caffaro, Federica/P-2359-2018; Cremasco, Margherita Micheletti/S-8354-2019; Bisaglia, carlo/Q-2607-2019; Cremasco, Margherita Micheletti/C-3689-2018";"Cavallo, Eugenio/0000-0002-2759-9629; Caffaro, Federica/0000-0003-3911-5924; Cremasco, Margherita Micheletti/0000-0002-5948-7584; Bisaglia, carlo/0000-0002-2699-0757; Cremasco, Margherita Micheletti/0000-0002-5948-7584; Cutini, Maurizio/0000-0002-6003-5382";Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Alimentary and Forestry Policies, MiPAAF (Project INTRAC - Integration of ergonomic aspects and safety in agricultural tractors) [12488/7303/11];"Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Alimentary and Forestry Policies, MiPAAF (Project INTRAC - Integration of ergonomic aspects and safety in agricultural tractors; Decree n. 12488/7303/11; June 6th, 2011).";;47;1;1;0;7;SPANISH NATL INST AGRICULTURAL & FOOD RESEARCH & TECHNOLO;MADRID;AUTOPISTA A-6, KM 7 5, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN;1695-971X;2171-9292;;SPAN J AGRIC RES;Span.

The solution to this problem is currently implemented using the Gartner scale, the CMMI methodology, the five-level BI maturity model, the People-CMM model; and classification of the process management system conditions in industrial enterprises. Within the framework of this paper, the existing toolkit has been supplemented by two ways of assessing process maturity: based on the technology of studying business processes and the stages of implementing process management, taking into account the applied methodologies. The advantages and shortages of the toolkit were revealed. The shortage of determining the enterprise management system maturity based on the technology used to study existing business processes is the absence of a scale for assessing the maturity, as well as the subjective factor influence on an expert assessment. The shortages of the existing process management system maturity classifications are specific. When choosing a classification (scale), it must take into account its unique features that affect the results of the analysis. The shortage of assessing the process management maturity based on the stages of process management implementation and applied methodologies is the possibility of simultaneous implementation of the process management stages, which complicates determination of the achieved maturity level.

Further improvements will be driven by the development of intelligent image analysis allowing automated detection of microbial growth, release of sterile samples, identification and quantification of bacterial colonies and reading of AST disk diffusion assays. We investigated the potential benefit of intelligent imaging analysis by developing algorithms allowing automated detection, semi-quantification and identification of bacterial colonies. Methods: Defined monomicrobial and clinical urine samples were inoculated by the BD Kiestra (TM) InoqulA (TM) BT module. Image acquisition of plates was performed with the BD Kiestra (TM) ImagA BT digital imaging module using the BD Kiestra (TM) Optis (TM) imaging software. The algorithms were developed and trained using defined data sets and their performance evaluated on both defined and clinical samples. Results: The detection algorithms exhibited 97.1% sensitivity and 93.6% specificity for microbial growth detection. Moreover, quantification accuracy of 80.2% and of 98.6% when accepting a 1 log tolerance was obtained with both defined monomicrobial and clinical urine samples, despite the presence of multiple species in the clinical samples. Automated identification accuracy of microbial colonies growing on chromogenic agar from defined isolates or clinical urine samples ranged from 98.3% to 99.7%, depending on the bacterial species tested. Conclusion: The development of intelligent algorithm represents a major innovation that has the potential to significantly increase laboratory quality and productivity while reducing turn-around-times.

J;Kim, DG;;;;Kim, Dae-Gi;;;Selection and Management of Medical Official during the Yuan Dynasty;KOREAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL HISTORY;;;Korean;Article;;;;;;"Yuan healthcare; Song healthcare; Medical examination system; Yihu; Guanyitijusi; Yixuetijus. Zhusehuji. Yixue; medical school";;"Although the healthcare system of the Yuan Dynasty followed that of the Song Dynasty, there are certain differences between these two dynasties in terms of practices. Including appointing 'Yihus' in 'Zhusehuji' and setting up 'Guanyitijusi' to oversee Yihus, the Yuan Dynasty developed an effective management system for their physicians and, soon after the coronation of Khubilai, built 'Yixue (Medical school)' all over its territories in order to establish an organized and substantial medical training system. Moreover, the Yuan Dynasty not only revived the civil service examination system system between 1314 and 1320 as well as the medical examination system, but also increased the quota for qualification to twice that of Confucian examination in Song. These changes resulted in producing many brilliant people at the time. In the second half of the reign of Emperor Chengzong it was decided that the incompetence of the government healthcare organizations and the abundance of charlatans could not be neglected any longer. Existing policies and systems was limited in educating and training proper physicians, and this problem was not restricted to the field of medicine. The need for new systems that could reform the social order led to the restoration of the civil service examination system. The civil service examination system for Confucianism and for medicine began in 1314 and 1316, respectively. The purpose of the medical examination system was to select medical officials. The medical examination system which started in 1316 had a significant impact on the medicine of the Yuan dynasty for many reasons. Firstly, the qualification to apply to the medical examination did not remain constricted to 'Yixue' but opened to all 'Zhusehuji'; and secondly, the examination system did not have a restriction on the number of applicants was not restricted. The most important aspect of the examination system was that the number of test takers that passed the first test was one hundred and the number of passers of the second test were thirty, which were not low compared to the number of passers of the Confucianism examination. As such, the impact of the medical examination on the Yuan society was substantial. The Confucian examination selected 300 persons to pass the first test. The second test had 100 test takers which was equally divided among the four social classes at 25 percent each. The medical system selected 100 persons in the first test and 30 in the second. What is important is that unlike the Confucian examination system, the medical system was not divided into four classes. Hypothetically, the 30 qualified persons could all be South Chinese. In terms of the number of passers, it was much more promising for the South Chinese to flourish through the medical test than through Confucian examination test. Such facts support the claim that the Yuan Dynasty emphasized the field of medicine compared to the Song Dynasty. Although the Song Dynasty implemented the civil service examination system early on, the medical system was not implemented until 1115, which started with the founding of 'Yixue' across the country and assigning student capacity. During the Song Dynasty, the number of students in the medical system was 15 percent of that in the Confucianism system, and compared to that in Yuan, it raised to 30 percent, which is twofold. The indications of the Yuan Dynasty valuing medicine and making an effort to educate and train medical experts can be seen in the 'Yihu system', 'Guanyitijusi', Yixuetijusi', and medical school as well as the ratio of the medical system capacity.";[Kim, Dae-Gi] Kangwon Nation Univ, Dept Hist, Chunchon, South Korea;Kim, DG (corresponding author), Kangwon Nation Univ, Dept Hist, Chunchon, South Korea.;dgkim@kangwon.ac.kr;;;;;;0;0;0;0;2;KOREAN SOC HIST MED;SEOUL;SEOUL NAT UNIV, DEPT MED HIST, COLL MED, 28 YEONGEON-DONG, JONGRO-GU, SEOUL, 00000, SOUTH KOREA;1225-505X;;;KOR J MED HIST;Kor.

The idea is to configure robot work cells based on the total number of robots and its variations of layouts. At present, the multi-shaped layout of robot work cells is developed by joining two or more robot work cells in the form of a square-shaped layout based on several constraints and conditions. Data on the probable multi-shaped layouts of robot work cells have been tabulated, and the complexity of data for each configuration was compared. Afterward, the configuration with the least complexity was selected to be the optimum configuration concept. As a result, a configuration pattern with a mathematical relation between the number of robots and the number of possible multi-shaped layouts was able to be extracted using MATLAB. The details regarding the development phases of this work are presented. The primary purpose of this work is to provide a configuration concept of robot work cells for assisting system design engineers in configuring robot work cells which could enhance configuration time, minimise human and expert involvement, and capitalise available investment resources in future. This developmental outcome is relevant for inline configurations of robot work cells. The currentoutcomes of this work provide a basic concept for future investigation on developing a flexible configuration system for multiple robot work cells.;"[Osman, N. S.; Rahman, M. A.

The research literature about political micro-targeting hardly ever focusses on campaigns in parliamentary democracies with strict data protection laws. Based on in-depth expert interviews we introduce a framework of constraints in strategic political communication and reveal several restrictions on the macro, meso and micro levels which hinder the implementation of sophisticated data strategies in Germany.

Automated formal techniques for consistency checking of requirements, mostly by means of model checking, have been proposed in academia. Sometimes such techniques incur a high modeling cost or analysis time, or are not applicable. To address such problems, in this paper we propose an automated consistency analysis technique of requirements that are formalized based on patterns, and checked using state-of-the-art Satisfiability Modulo Theories solvers. Our method assumes several transformation steps, from textual requirements to formal logic, and next into the format suited for the SMT tool. To automate such steps, we propose a tool, called PROPAS, that does not require any user intervention during the transformation and analysis phases, thus making the consistency analysis usable by non-expert practitioners. For validation, we apply our method on a set of timed computation tree logic requirements of an industrial automotive system called the Fuel Level Display.;"[Filipovikj, Predrag; Rodriguez-Navas, Guillermo; Seceleanu, Cristina] Malardalen Univ, Vasteras, Sweden; [Nyberg, Mattias] Scania AB CV, Sodertalje, Sweden";Filipovikj, P (corresponding author), Malardalen Univ, Vasteras, Sweden.;"predrag.filipovikj@mdh.se; guillermo.rodriguez-navas@mdh.se; mattias.nyberg@scania.com; cristina.seceleanu@mdh.se";Seceleanu, Cristina/AAG-7625-2020;;Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA)Vinnova [2013-01299];This work has been funded by the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA) under the VeriSpec project 2013-01299.;;26;0;0;0;1;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;1559-6915;;;APPL COMPUT REV;Appl.

J;Alexin, Z;;;;Alexin, Zoltan;;;Hungary's unorthodox approach to personal privacy;HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Medical privacy; Medical research ethics; Medical secrecy; Legal regulation; Personal data protection; Fundamental rights; Right to respect private and family life";;Hungary's special approach to political and social questions is frequently analysed by the media. Taking a closer look at the details of the privacy regulations, we can also identify several unique features. For Hungary, the era of socialism ended with the proclamation of the new Republic of Hungary on 23rd October, 1989. The substantially renewed constitution was entered into force on the same day. The fundamental rights defined in the European Convention of Human Rights were included in it and, in addition, the right to the protection of personal data. The main characteristic of the legal system is that politicians understand the constitution so that it would always require passing a new law whenever they want a public authority to collect personal data for some purpose. By now, Hungary has several hundred laws and decrees in effect on the obligatory collection and transfer of personal data. The nature of such types of regulation ab ovo excludes the possibility of objection and challenging a regulation before the court. Turning our attention to healthcare, we see that medical authorities and researchers are authorized by the law to collect personal medical data without providing information and the right to object to data subjects. The author has been studying the changes in the medical privacy regulations since 2004. Here, he gives an account of the key characteristics of the Hungarian legislation and provides a comparison with the relevant European Union legislation in relation to medical data. When the EU General Data Protection Regulation came into force, the conflict between the two became obvious. This paper gives the reader an expert's view of the Hungarian data protection policy, while attempting to pave the way to stimulate social debate concerning the necessity for better, and more privacy aware legislation.;[Alexin, Zoltan] Univ Szeged, Dept Software Engn, Dugon Ter 13, H-6720 Szeged, Hungary;Alexin, Z (corresponding author), Univ Szeged, Dept Software Engn, Dugon Ter 13, H-6720 Szeged, Hungary.;alexin@inf.u-szeged.hu;;;European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [COST IC1206];The author wishes to express his thanks for the valuable support received from the COST IC1206 De-identification for privacy purposes of multimedia content project of the European Union.;;17;0;0;0;0;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;2190-7188;2190-7196;;HEALTH TECHNOL-GER;Health Technol.;DEC;2017;7;4;;;;;423;440;;10.1007/s12553-017-0181-7;;;18;Medical Informatics;Medical Informatics;FU8BG;WOS:000424076200012;;;;;2021-02-18;

Failed airway management results in death or anoxic brain injury. A codified, systems-based approach to bring personnel and equipment to the bedside for multidisciplinary airway assessment and rescue was reflected in the initial implementation of an airway rapid response (ARR) team. Methods: A retrospective review of records of 117 ARR events in a 40-month period (August 2011-November 2014) was undertaken at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, a 789-bed, academic, urban, tertiary care, Level 1 trauma center. Results: Of the 117 ARR events, 60 (51.3%) were called in the ICU, and 43 (36.8%) in the general ward. A definitive airway was secured in all patients for whom airway management was attempted. A new surgical airway was performed in five of the patients. Seven patients went to the operating room for airway management. Nine patients died or had care withdrawn shortly after the ARR. Conclusion: Difficult airway emergencies represent a small but critical element of airway rescue scenarios. Before the implementation of the ARR system, the process to bring the right team, equipment, expertise, and consensus on the right actions to critical airway emergencies was ad hoc. ARR activation, which brings multidisciplinary airway consultation, expert skills, and advanced airway equipment to the bedside, contributed to definitive airway management for surgical and nonsurgical airways. Performance of a bedside emergency surgical airway was uncommon. The ARR system represents a significant enhancement of the anesthesia stat system that typifies the airway emergency system at many institutions.;"[Atkins, Joshua H.] Univ Penn, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Atkins, Joshua H.; Rassekh, Christopher H.] Univ Penn, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Chalian, Ara A.] Univ Penn, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Chalian, Ara A.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Zhao, Jing] Perelman Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Zhao, Jing] Beijing Union Med Coll Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jing] Perelman Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care, Philadelphia, PA USA";"Atkins, JH (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.; Atkins, JH (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.";Atkinsj@uphs.upenn.edu;;;;;;12;7;7;0;2;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;1553-7250;1938-131X;;JT COMM J QUAL PATIE;Jt.

This paper proposes a novel hybrid method encompassing factor relationship (FARE) and multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC) methods for selection and evaluation of NTMPs. The application of FARE method is pioneered in NTMP assessment domain to estimate criteria weights. It significantly condenses the problem of pairwise comparisons for estimating criteria weights in MCDM environment. In order to analyze and rank different NTMPs in accordance with their performance and technical properties, MABAC method is applied. Computational procedure of FARE-MABAC hybrid model is demonstrated while solving an NTMP selection problem for drilling cylindrical through holes on non-conductive ceramic materials. The results achieved by FARE-MABAC method exactly corroborate with those obtained by the past researchers which validate the usefulness of this method while solving complex NTMP selection problems.;"[Chatterjee, Prasenjit; Banerjee, Arnab] MCKV Inst Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Howrah 711204, India; [Mondal, Supraksh] Mallabhum Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Boral, Soumava] Indian Inst Technol, Subir Chodhury Sch Qual & Reliabil, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India; [Chakraborty, Shankar] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Prod Engn, Kolkata, W Bengal, India";Chatterjee, P (corresponding author), MCKV Inst Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Howrah 711204, India.;prasenjit2007@gmail.com;"Banerjee, Arnab/C-1149-2019; Boral, Soumava/AAJ-9610-2020; Chatterjee, Prasenjit/D-4254-2011; Boral, Soumava/K-7261-2018";"Banerjee, Arnab/0000-0003-0004-4276; Boral, Soumava/0000-0001-9616-3397; Chatterjee, Prasenjit/0000-0002-7994-4252; Boral, Soumava/0000-0001-9616-3397";;;;39;31;31;0;3;UNIV NIS;NIS;UNIVERZITETSKI TRG 2, PO BOX 123, NIS, 18000, SERBIA;0354-2025;2335-0164;;FACTA UNIV-SER MECH;Facta Univ.-Ser.

This is often driven by the desire to find the best subject matter experts, strongly incentivize them, and engage them with as little coordination cost as possible. A growing number of authors, however, are calling for increased collaboration in crowdsourcing settings, hoping to draw upon the advantages of teamwork observed in traditional settings. The question is how to effectively incorporate team-based collaboration in a setting that has traditionally been individual-based. We report on a large-field experiment of team collaboration on an online platform, in which incentives and team membership were randomly assigned, to evaluate the influence of exogenous inputs (member skills and incentives) and emergent collaboration processes on performance of crowd-based teams. Building on advances in machine learning and complex systems theory, we leverage new measurement techniques to examine the content and timing of team collaboration. We find that temporal burstiness of team activity and the diversity of information exchanged among team members are strong predictors of performance, even when inputs such as incentives and member skills are controlled.

In order to achieve sustainable power development and improve the power supply structure, China's government has focused on distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation projects due to their advantages of clean emission and local consumption. However, their unstable output power still brings a series of problems concerning reliability, investment income, and available substitution proportion to traditional power, and so on. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the competitive development abilities of distributed PV generation projects and measure them effectively. First, through various investigation methods such as literature reviews, feasibility report analysis and expert interviews, the factors that influence the core abilities of distributed PV-generation projects were explored based on the micro-grid structure. Then, with the indexed exploration results, the factors were classified into 6 dimensions, i.e., investment and earning ability, production and operation ability, power-grid coordination ability, energy-conservation and emission-reduction ability, sustainable development ability, and society-serving ability. Meanwhile, an evaluation index system for core abilities of distributed PV-generation project was constructed using all quantitative indicators. Third, for examining the availability of the evaluation index system, combination weighting and techniques for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods were adopted to assess the practical distributed PV-generation projects. The case study results showed that installed capacity, local economy development, and grid-connected power quantity will influence the core abilities of distributed PV-generation project, obviously. The conclusions of the evaluation analysis on core abilities can provide useful references to operate and manage distributed PV-generation projects and promote their sustainable and health advantages. The proposed evaluation index system can also be used to assess power-generation projects in other types of energy, such as wind power and hydropower.;"[He, Lin; Li, Chang-Ling; Men, Yan; Shao, Hai] State Grid Xinjiang Elect Power Corp, Econ & Technol Res Inst, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Nie, Qing-Yun] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jiang] State Power Investment Corp Res Inst, Strateg & Econ Res Dept, Beijing 102209, Peoples R China";Zhu, J (corresponding author), State Power Investment Corp Res Inst, Strateg & Econ Res Dept, Beijing 102209, Peoples R China.;"hbdlljp@163.com; paperxjl@163.com; nqyncepu@ncepu.edu.cn; ljp@ncepu.edu.cn; shaohaixj@126.com; zhujiang1125@126.com";;;"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71501071]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M550937]; Ministry of Education in China Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [14JF005]; Beijing Social Science Fund [16YJC064]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities";This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (71501071), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2014M550937), the Ministry of Education in China Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (14JF005), the Beijing Social Science Fund (16YJC064), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.;;37;8;8;2;13;MDPI AG;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;1996-1073;;;ENERGIES;Energies;DEC;2017;10;12;;;;;;;2083;10.3390/en10122083;;;18;Energy & Fuels;Energy & Fuels;FT4WW;WOS:000423156900154;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-02-18;

Although the skills of expert engineers have a great influence on the finish, learning these skills require a lot of experience and time. In Japan, the number of young people in the automobile mechanic and automobile repair industry is drastically decreasing due to the declining birthrates, the trend of young people turning away from driving cars, and the diversification of occupation options. Moreover, the aging of the mechanics and repair technicians has been progressing, and the average age of the mechanics and repair technicians remaining in this industry has been increasing every year. In the near future, there is a high possibility that the shortage of human resources supporting this industry will become apparent. In this study, we aimed to construct a self-study support system for young engineers engaged in automobile repair painting to support skill acquisition, using e-learning teaching materials utilizing motion analysis data on block painting by solid paint done by experienced engineers.

J;Tutt, A;;;;Tutt, Andrew;;;AN FDA FOR ALGORITHMS;ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW;;;English;Article;;;;;;;INNOVATION;The rise of increasingly complex algorithms calls for critical thought about how best to prevent, deter, and compensate for the harms that they cause. This Article argues that the criminal law and tort regulatory systems will prove no match for the difficult regulatory puzzles algorithms pose. Algorithmic regulation will require federal uniformity, expert judgment, political independence, and pre-market review to prevent without stifling innovation the introduction of unacceptably dangerous algorithms into the market. This Article proposes that certain classes of new algorithms should not be permitted to be distributed or sold without approval from a government agency designed along the lines of the FDA. This FDA for Algorithms would approve certain complex and dangerous algorithms when it could be shown that they would be safe and effective for their intended use and that satisfactory measures would be taken to prevent their harmful misuse. Lastly, this Article proposes that the agency should serve as a centralized expert regulator that develops guidance, standards, and expertise in partnership with industry to strike a balance between innovation and safety.;[Tutt, Andrew] US Dept Justice, Off Legal Counsel, Washington, DC 20530 USA;Tutt, A (corresponding author), US Dept Justice, Off Legal Counsel, Washington, DC 20530 USA.;;;;;;;113;39;39;3;3;AMER BAR ASSOC, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW & REGULATORY PRACTICE SECTION;CHICAGO;321 N CLARK ST, CHICAGO, IL 60610 USA;0001-8368;2326-9154;;ADMIN LAW REV;Adm.

Benes";;The article analyzes the US policy towards the Czechoslovak government-in-exile in 1943-1945. At that time President of the Czechoslovak Republic in exile E. Benes formulated the program for the post-war reconstruction of his country, focused on equal relations with the main allied powers: the United Kingdom, the USSR and the United States. Assuming that the independence of Czechoslovakia would primarily depend on good relations with the Soviet Union, Benes visited Moscow in December 1943 and in March 1945. During the first visit he concluded the Soviet-Czechoslovak agreement of mutual assistance for 20 years. The second visit was devoted to the negotiations on further cooperation with the USSR and discussions of the new Czechoslovak government its composition and communists' participation. In April 1945 the government members were transferred to the Slovak city of Kosice, liberated and controlled by the Red Army. The article deals with the US State Department's attitude towards the Czechoslovakian situation and its development in this period. American experts' and diplomats' opinions on the emerging Soviet-Czechoslovak rapprochement, their reaction to the post-war development program of the CSR are highlighted. The author notes their increasing fears about the Soviet policy on the liberated territory of this country, about the strengthening of the communist influence there. He analyzes American experts' forecasts about the new Czechoslovak government composition, their assessment of agreements reached in Moscow, estimates of the Kosice program and proclamation of the further rapprochement with the USSR. The place of Czechoslovakia in the American plans for the post-war Europe is being considered as well. The first diplomatic clash between Moscow and Washington on the Czechoslovak issue happened in April-May 1945 because of the Soviet Government's refusal to allow Western diplomats to Kosice. Americans attempts to overcome it were unsuccessful. Its result was the emergence of a serious suspicion in Washington about Moscow's desire to expand its sphere of influence in Central Europe. The situation with Czechoslovakia demonstrated that, despite the war cooperation, the US had serious concerns about Soviet intentions. Americans preferred to see Czechoslovakia as a pro-western democratic state and were afraid of a communist regime being established there. However, the US avoided direct intervention, counting on the gradual return of the Czechoslovak Republic to the pre-war democratic system. Benes's course allowed the US to test the USSR's desire and ability to build normal political relations with the neighboring countries in practice. The article is based on the analysis of primary sources from the United States National Archives, the Library of Congress, the Foreign Policy Archive of the Russian Federation.;"[Yungblyud, Valeriy T.; Zorin, Artem V.] Vyatka State Univ, Kirov, Russia";Yungblyud, VT (corresponding author), Vyatka State Univ, Kirov, Russia.;"youngblood@vyatsu.ru; arzor@list.ru";"Zorin, Artem V/W-1762-2018; Yungblyud, Valeriy T./J-8665-2016";"Zorin, Artem V/0000-0002-3238-9036; Yungblyud, Valeriy T./0000-0002-2706-3904";;;;24;0;0;0;2;TOMSK STATE UNIV;TOMSK;LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;1561-7793;1561-803X;;TOMSK STATE UNIV J;Tomsk State Univ.

Sleep is defined as a periodic physiological state during which vigilance is suspended and reactivity to external stimulations diminished. We sleep on average between six and nine hours per night and our sleep is composed of four to six cycles of about 90 min each. Each of these cycles is composed of a succession of several stages of sleep that vary in depth. Analysis of sleep is usually done via polysomnography. This examination consists of recording, among other things, electrical cerebral activity by electroencephalography (EEG), ocular movements by electrooculography (EOG), and chin muscle tone by electromyography (EMG). Recordings are made mostly in a hospital, more specifically in a service for monitoring the pathologies related to sleep. The readings are then interpreted manually by an expert to generate a hypnogram, a curve showing the succession of sleep stages during the night in 30s epochs. The proposed method is based on the follow-up of the thermal signature that makes it possible to classify the activity into three classes: awakening, calm sleep, and restless sleep. The contribution of this non-invasive method is part of the screening of sleep disorders, to be validated by a more complete analysis of the sleep. The measure provided by this new system, based on temperature monitoring (patient and ambient), aims to be integrated into the tele-medicine platform developed within the framework of the Smart-EEG project by the SYEL-SYstemes ELectroniques team. Analysis of the data collected during the first surveys carried out with this method showed a correlation between thermal signature and activity during sleep. The advantage of this method lies in its simplicity and the possibility of carrying out measurements of activity during sleep and without direct contact with the patient at home or hospitals.;"[Seba, Ali; Istrate, Dan; Guettari, Toufik] Univ Technol Compiegne, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, UMR Biomech & Bioengn 7338, F-60200 Compiegne, France; [Seba, Ali; Ugon, Adrien; Pinna, Andrea; Garda, Patrick] UPMC, SYEL Lab, LIP6, F-75005 Paris, France";Istrate, D (corresponding author), Univ Technol Compiegne, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, UMR Biomech & Bioengn 7338, F-60200 Compiegne, France.;"sbaa91@gmail.com; mircea-dan.istrate@utc.fr; toufik.guettari@utc.fr; adrien.ugon@lip6.fr; andrea.pinna@lip6.fr; Patrick.Garda@upmc.fr";;;EBIOMED Chair-IUIS (Institut Universitaire d'Ingenierie en Sante);This work was funded within the framework of EBIOMED Chair-IUIS (Institut Universitaire d'Ingenierie en Sante).

The geospatial database was prepared through integrated remote sensing, geographical information systems, and GPS technologies. The methods adopted for the present study are frequency ratio (FR) which is probabilistic and analytical hierarchical process (AHP) which is subjective and objective based model. The FR values were evaluated through evaluating relationship between causative factors and past landslide (training) locations. The FR values were considered as the base for assigning the weights in AHP method along with the subjective knowledge. The final LSZ map were derived through the spatial integration of all causative factors and classified as different susceptibility classes viz. very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The prediction accuracy of final LSZ map were validated using past landslide (validation) locations using area under curve (AUC) method.

An updated version of consensus-based recommendations on the management of HCC has been recently published by a multidisciplinary group of Chinese experts including liver surgeons, hepatic oncologists, radiologists and pathologists. Major changes have been made to the diagnostic criteria. In addition to dynamic multi-detector computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) are added to the diagnostic imaging tests. Meanwhile, positive alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) no longer functions as a confirmatory test in nodules of 1-2 cm in diameter. For patients with chronic hepatitis B/C or cirrhosis of any cause, nodules more than 2 cm can be diagnosed with HCC based on typical features on one of the four imaging techniques, whereas nodules <= 2 cm need two typical imaging findings for diagnosis. Based on the increased evidences and clinical practices, a new staging system and treatment algorithm has been developed to be more comprehensible and suitable for use in China. Surgical resection, transplantation and local regional therapies (LRTs) are indicated for more progressed HCC in terms of tumor burden and for more diseased patients in terms of liver function in China than in western centers. Laparoscopic liver resections (LLRs) are not restricted by intrahepatic tumor locations and the volume of resected liver, provided lesions generally <= 10 cm. Future efforts involving prospective studies are essential to confirm the validity of the current Chinese guidelines for HCC.;"[Xie, Di-Yang; Ren, Zheng-Gang; Zhou, Jian; Fan, Jia; Gao, Qiang] Fudan Univ, Key Lab Carcinogenesis & Canc Invas, Zhongshan Hosp, Liver Canc Inst,Minist Educ, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jian; Fan, Jia] Fudan Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China";Gao, Q (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Liver Canc Inst, Zhongshan Hosp, Dept Liver Surg & Transplantat, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.;gao.qiang@zs-hospital.sh.cn;;Gao, Qiang/0000-0002-6695-9906;"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81522036]; National Program for Special Support of Eminent Professionals";This study is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81522036) and National Program for Special Support of Eminent Professionals.;;66;40;45;1;13;AME PUBL CO;SHATIN;FLAT-RM C 16F, KINGS WING PLAZA 1, NO 3 KWAN ST, SHATIN, HONG KONG 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA;2304-3881;2304-389X;;HEPATOBIL SURG NUTR;Hepatob.

To thwart such attacks, software protections are manually inserted requiring experts and time. The explosion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in home, business, and public spaces motivates the hardening of a wider class of applications and the need to offer security solutions to non-experts. This article addresses the automated protection of loops at compilation time, covering the widest range of control-and data-flow patterns, in both shape and complexity. The security property we consider is that a sensitive loop must always perform the expected number of iterations; otherwise, an attack must be reported. We propose a generic compile-time loop hardening scheme based on the duplication of termination conditions and of the computations involved in the evaluation of such conditions. We also investigate how to preserve the security property along the compilation flow while enabling aggressive optimizations. We implemented this algorithm in LLVM 4.0 at the Intermediate Representation (IR) level in the backend. On average, the compiler automatically hardens 95% of the sensitive loops of typical security benchmarks, and 98% of these loops are shown to be robust to simulated faults.

The opinions indicate that it should not be assumed that certified plantations are necessarily perceived as the most sustainable ones, that there is always a direct relationship between certification, nor that forest owners and managers certify their woodlands in order to guarantee sustainability. The results also showed that perceptions of certification and sustainability were not influenced by the opinions of different groups of stakeholders.";"[Diaz-Balteiro, Luis] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETS Ingn Montes Forestal & Medio Nat, Ciudad Univ S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Garcia de Jalon, Silvestre] Univ Basque Country, BC3, Bldg 1,1st Floor,Sci Campus,Barrio Sarriena S-N, Leioa, Spain";Diaz-Balteiro, L (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, ETS Ingn Montes Forestal & Medio Nat, Ciudad Univ S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.;"luis.diaz.balteiro@upm.es; silvestre.garciadejalon@bc3research.org";Diaz-Balteiro, Luis/B-7169-2009;Diaz-Balteiro, Luis/0000-0002-4435-2740;Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [AGL2015-68657-R];The authors deeply appreciate the patience and cooperation of all the stakeholders who answered the survey.

The need to ensure the continuous and proper functioning of a product has led designers to pay special attention to increasing reliability. Therefore by coordinating all design experts and support groups throughout the implementation of product life cycle, the product development life cycle period can be reduced and value-creation of products increased. As a result, the existence of a comprehensive model is of vital importance. In this study, all industrial engineering techniques effective in improving reliability are first identified and then prioritized in all phases of the product life cycle using multicriteria decision making method.

As there may be numerous system architectures based on different adaptable options, assessing the viability of these architectures under uncertainty as for the basis of compression and selecting the optimized one is an important problem now a day.

As a result, distinct risks threatening the operation of individual systems can no longer be treated in isolation. Risk experts are actively seeking ways to relax the risk independence assumption that undermines typical risk management models. Prominent work has advocated the use of risk networks as a way forward. However, the inevitable biases introduced during the generation of these survey-based risk networks limit our ability to examine their topology and in turn challenge the utility of the very notion of a risk network. To alleviate these concerns, we propose an alternative methodology for generating weighted risk networks. We subsequently apply this methodology to an empirical data set of financial data. This paper reports our findings on the study of the topology of the resulting risk network. We observe a modular topology and reason on its use as a robust risk classification framework. Using these modules, we highlight a tendency of specialization during the risk identification process, with some firms being solely focused on a subset of the available risk classes. Finally, we consider the independent and systemic impact of some risks and attribute possible mismatches to their emerging nature.;"[Ellinas, Christos; Allan, Neil] Univ Bristol, Senate House,Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England; [Ellinas, Christos; Allan, Neil] System Consult Ltd, 4 Bridge St, Bradford On Avon BA15 1EJ, England; [Coombe, Caroline] ORIC Int, 17 Crosswall, London EC3N 2LB, England";"Ellinas, C (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Senate House,Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England.; Ellinas, C (corresponding author), System Consult Ltd, 4 Bridge St, Bradford On Avon BA15 1EJ, England.";"ce12183@bristol.ac.uk; fenda@bristol.ac.uk; caroline.coombe@oricinternational.com";;Ellinas, Christos/0000-0001-5146-6554;Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [1224532] Funding Source: researchfish;;;44;0;0;0;0;INCISIVE MEDIA;LONDON;HAYMARKET HOUSE, 28-29 HAYMARKET, LONDON, SW1Y 4RX, ENGLAND;2055-7795;2055-7809;;J NETW THEORY FINANC;J.

Historically, this was strong in some Western countries with doctors finding that it enhanced their authority, prestige and power. But it weakened in the 20th century when the biomedical model of heath triumphed and medicine became a dominant profession. In the second part of the 20th century, this dominance was threatened by political, technological and socioeconomic forces. These weakened medicine's state support, brought it under managerial control and undermined the social contract on which trust between doctors and the community was based. Defence of the profession was assumed by medical colleges, societies and associations. They had some success in retaining professional autonomy but did not undertake open advocacy, particularly on social justice issues, and did not therefore enhance their standing in the community. Opinion is divided on the level of advocacy that it is ethically proper for the medical profession to employ. Some contend doctors should only advise authorities when expert opinion is requested. Others contend doctors should speak out proactively on all health issues, and that collective action of this type is a hallmark of professionalism. This lack of consensus needs to be debated. Recent developments such as clinical leadership have not revitalised physician advocacy. However, continued deterioration of the UK National Health Service has led some English medical colleges to take up open advocacy in its defence. It is to be seen whether medical colleges elsewhere follow suit, as and when their healthcare systems are similarly threatened.;"[Bagshaw, Philip] Univ Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Barnett, Pauline] Univ Canterbury, Hlth Sci Ctr, Christchurch, New Zealand";Bagshaw, P (corresponding author), Canterbury Char Hosp Trust, POB 20409,349-353 Harewood Rd, Christchurch 8054, New Zealand.;philipfbagshaw@gmail.com;;;;;;54;2;2;1;5;NEW ZEALAND MEDICAL ASSOC;CHRISTCHURCH;C/O BRENNAN EDWARDES, DEPT SURGERY, CHRISTCHURCH HOSPITAL, PO BOX 4345, CHRISTCHURCH, 00000, NEW ZEALAND;0028-8446;1175-8716;;NEW ZEAL MED J;N.

Two research staff independently reviewed a random sample of 5 patient days to assess interrater reliability with complete scoring agreement. To assess face validity, eight nurse clinician experts reviewed factors included in the Nursing Intensity of Care Index to assess the accuracy of the nursing time estimates in the tool. To examine concurrent validity, Nursing Intensity of Care Index scores for a random sample of 28 patients from four clinical units were compared with assessments made by a unit-based clinical nurse (low/medium/high intensity) for the same patients on the same day with a Spearman correlation of 0.94.

It is considered as a sentinel event, consequence of dysfunctions of the health care system, often cumulative. In addition to the classical epidemiological surveillance outcomes-number of deaths, maternal mortality ratio and identification of the subgroups of women at risk-its study allows an accurate analysis of each deceased woman's trajectory to identify opportunities for improvements in the content or organization of care; the correction of which will make it possible to prevent deaths but also upstream morbid events affected by the same dysfunctions. To achieve this dual epidemiological and clinical audit objective, an ad hoc enhanced system is needed. France has had such a system since 1996, the National Confidential enquiry into maternal deaths (ENCMM), coordinated by the Inserm Epope team. The first step is the multi-source identification (direct declaration, death certificate, birth certificates, hospital discharge data) of women who died during pregnancy or within one year of its end. The second step is the collection of detailed information for each death by a pair of clinical assessors. The third stage is the review of these anonymized documents by the National Committee of Experts on Maternal Mortality, which judges whether the death is maternal (causal link) and makes a judgment on the adequacy of care and avoidability of death. The synthesis of the information thus collected for maternal deaths in the period 2010-2012 is the subject of the last report. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Among the 23 deaths of indirect cause related to a preexisiting pathology, 22 (96 %) have been analyzed by the expert comity. A known or preexisting chronic disease was documented in 16 patients (sick-cell disorder, n = 3, treated epilepsy, n = 3, intracerebral carvenomas, n = 1, multifocal glial tumor, n = 1, breast cancer, n = 1, systemic lupus, n = 1, diabetes mellitus, n = 3, antiphospholipid syndrome, n = 1). For 6 women, the pathology was unknown before the pregnancy (glioblastoma, n = 2, epilepsy, n = 1, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, n =1, sick-cell disorder, n = 1, breast cancer, n = 1). While 6 of these deaths has been evaluated as not avoidable, 13 deaths has been considered as possibly (n = 12) or certainly (n = 1) preventable. The main factor of avoidability was the patient's interaction with the health system (medically non advised pregnancy, lack of adherence to treatment, for example). A pre-pregnancy medical consultation with a specialist should be recommended to all patients with preexisting chronic disease, to allow a complete information about the risks of a pregnancy, treatment adaptation if needed, better adherence and multidisciplinary follow up.

Hence, despite their success in many sectors, developers of Medical Rule-Based Systems have met several critical problems. Firstly, the rules are related to a clearly stated subject. Secondly, a rule-based system can only learn by updating of its rule-base, since it requires explicit knowledge of the used domain. Solutions to these problems have been sought through improved techniques and tools, improved development paradigms, knowledge modeling languages and ontology, as well as advanced reasoning techniques such as case-based reasoning (CBR) which is well suited to provide decision support in the healthcare setting. However, using CBR reveals some drawbacks, mainly in its interrelated tasks: the retrieval and the adaptation. For the retrieval task, a major drawback raises when several similar cases are found and consequently several solutions. Hence, a choice for the best solution must be done. To overcome these limitations, numerous useful works related to the retrieval task were conducted with simple and convenient procedures or by combining CBR with other techniques. Through this paper, we provide a combining approach using the multi-criteria analysis (MCA) to help, the traditional retrieval task of CBR, in choosing the best solution. Afterwards, we integrate this approach in a decision model to support medical decision. We present, also, some preliminary results and suggestions to extend our approach.;"[Abdelhak, Mansoul] Univ Skikda, Dept Comp Sci, Skikda, Algeria; [Abdelhak, Mansoul] Univ Oran 1 Ahmed Ben Bella, LIO Lab, Oran, Algeria; [Baghdad, Atmani] Univ Oran 1 Ahmed Ben Bella, Dept Sci, Oran, Algeria";"Abdelhak, M (corresponding author), Univ Skikda, Dept Comp Sci, Skikda, Algeria.; Abdelhak, M (corresponding author), Univ Oran 1 Ahmed Ben Bella, LIO Lab, Oran, Algeria.";"mansoul21@gmail.com; atmani.baghdad@gmail.com";;;;;;52;2;2;0;4;KOREA INFORMATION PROCESSING SOC;SEOUL;1002HO YONGSUNGBIZTEL 314-1 2GA HANKANGRO YONGSAN-GU, SEOUL, 140-750, SOUTH KOREA;1976-913X;2092-805X;;J INF PROCESS SYST;J.

The resulting intracellular accumulation of GAGs leads to widespread tissue and organ dysfunction. In addition to somatic signs and symptoms, patients with MPS can present with neurological manifestations such as cognitive decline, behavioral problems (e.g. hyperactivity and aggressiveness), sleep disturbances, and/or epilepsy. These are associated with significant abnormalities of the central nervous system (CNS), including white and gray matter lesions, brain atrophy, ventriculomegaly, and spinal cord compression. In order to effectively manage and develop therapies for MPS that target neurological disease, it is important to visualize and quantify these CNS abnormalities. This review describes optimal approaches for conducting magnetic resonance imaging assessments in multi-center clinical studies, and summarizes current knowledge from neuroimaging studies in MPS disorders. The content of the review is based on presentations and discussions on these topics that were held during a meeting of an international group of experts.;"[Nestrasil, Igor] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, 717 Delaware St SE,Suite 358, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA; [Vedolin, Leonardo] DASA Grp, Dept Neuroradiol, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil";Nestrasil, I (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, 717 Delaware St SE,Suite 358, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA.;nestr007@umn.edu;Nestrasil, Igor/ABG-7030-2020;Nestrasil, Igor/0000-0002-3833-1484;BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.;This work was supported by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.;;61;7;7;0;2;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;1096-7192;1096-7206;;MOL GENET METAB;Mol.

These disorders are characterized by their progressive nature and a variety of somatic manifestations and neurological symptoms. There are established treatments for some MPS disorders, but these mostly alleviate somatic and non-neurological symptoms and do not cure the disease. Patients with MPS I, II, III, and VII can present with neurological manifestations such as neurocognitive decline and behavioral problems. Treatment of these neurological manifestations remains challenging due to the blood brain barrier (BBB) that limits delivery of therapeutic agents to the central nervous system (CNS). New therapies that circumvent this barrier and target brain disease in MPS are currently under development. They primarily focus on facilitating penetration of drugs through the BBB, delivery of recombinant enzyme to the brain by gene therapy, or direct CNS administration. This review summarizes existing and potential future treatment approaches that target brain disease in MPS. The information in this review is based on current literature and presentations and discussions during a closed meeting by an international group of experts with extensive experience in managing and treating MPS.;"[Scarpa, Maurizio] Helios Dr Horst Schmidt Kliniken, Ctr Rare Dis, Dept Paediat & Adolescent Med, Ludwig Erhard Str 100, D-65199 Wiesbaden, Germany; [Scarpa, Maurizio] Univ Padua, Dept Womens & Childrens Hlth, Padua, Italy; [Orchard, Paul J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Pediat, Div Pediat Blood & Marrow Transplantat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Schulz, Angela] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat, Hamburg, Germany; [Dickson, Patricia I.] Harbor UCLA Med Ctr, Dept Pediat, Los Angeles Biomed Res Inst, Torrance, CA 90509 USA; [Haskins, Mark E.] Univ Penn, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathobiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Haskins, Mark E.] Univ Penn, Sch Vet Med, Dept Clin Studies, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Escolar, Maria L.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Program Neurodev Rare Disorders,Childrens Hosp Pi, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Giugliani, Roberto] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Genet, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Giugliani, Roberto] INAGEMP, Med Genet Serv, HCPA, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil";Scarpa, M (corresponding author), Helios Dr Horst Schmidt Kliniken, Ctr Rare Dis, Dept Paediat & Adolescent Med, Ludwig Erhard Str 100, D-65199 Wiesbaden, Germany.;Maurizio.Scarpa@helios-kliniken.de;"Scarpa, Maurizio/AAC-1467-2019; Giugliani, Roberto/G-4790-2015";Giugliani, Roberto/0000-0001-9655-3686;BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.;This work was supported by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.;;140;28;29;0;4;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;1096-7192;1096-7206;;MOL GENET METAB;Mol.

Sleep disorders are a frequent manifestation of all types of MPS. Underlying causes are diverse and comprised of both respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. Sleep disordered breathing such as obstructive sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoventilation can arise in patients with upper airway obstruction and/or with alterations in respiratory mechanics, causing restrictive pulmonary disease. MPS patients with CNS disease can also develop sleep disturbances unrelated to ventilatory impairments, often associated with severe behavioral problems or night-time epileptic seizures.

Though nobody challenges it, it is necessary to draw attention to the enormous efforts in the sphere of formation and organisation of the education system. Transcarpathia, which for a long time had been under the rule of different states, was no exception. The problems of the formation of the education system, its active financing in the difficult period of the post-war collapse, the formation of a network of educational institutions, the active struggle against illiteracy of the population must be voiced in the lense of the role of an individual. The role of Andrey Mikhailovich Ignat, an extraordinary personality, scholar, Latinist, scientist, teacher, Dean of the Historical and Philological Faculty of Uzhgorod State University and a public figure has not been sufficiently analysed. It is necessary to give proper respect to this person, who had to revive and rebuild the regional education system in the post-war period. A.M. Ignat is also remembered as a scientist, the author of dissertations The Russian Wars of Stefan Batoriy (Debrecen, 1942), Essays on the History of the Development of Public Education in Transcarpathian Region (1945-1955) (USSR, 1956). He prepared a doctoral thesis but never got a chance to defend it. As a translator and expert in Latin, he translated the third volume of Mikhail Luchkay's The History of Carpathian Rusins, but he did not last until the publication in a modern printed form.;[Sharavara, T.

Therefore, food security is one of their main challenges. Participatory action research across food value chains (FVCs) can help stabilize and enhance food security by developing upgrading strategies (UPS) that enhance specific aspects of crop production, post-harvest processing, marketing, income generation, and consumption. However, prior to their widespread adoption or upscaling, UPS need holistic understandings of their potential social, ecological, economic, and institutional challenges and opportunities in target areas. This article reports the application of the ScalA-FS tool, which assessed the potential success of selected UPS using assessment criteria developed by agricultural scientists and local farmers in a participatory process in Tanzania. This work is embedded in a larger participatory research project conducted in semi-arid and sub-humid ecological settings of the Dodoma and Morogoro regions of Tanzania. Results from the assessment of the potential impact of the UPS differed strongly between the UPS and the social, economic and environmental assessment criteria, but only slightly between semi-arid and sub-humid regions. The positive impacts of food-securing UPS centre on productivity and income generation. Rain water harvesting, fertilizer micro-dosing, optimized weeding, and promotion of kitchen gardens were expected to have the highest impacts after implementation. The ScalA-FS ex-ante assessments provide a knowledge base about potential impacts, as well as the potential bottlenecks to address during the implementation of UPS.;"[Graef, Frieder; Uckert, Goetz; Schindler, Jana; Koenig, Hannes Jochen] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Inst Land Use Syst, Muncheberg, Germany; [Uckert, Goetz; Sieber, Stefan; Hoffmann, Harry] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Inst Socioecon, Muncheberg, Germany; [Mbwana, Hadijah A.] SUA, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Fasse, Anja; Kissoly, Luitfred] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, Hannover, Germany; [Mwinuka, Lutengano] Univ Dodoma UDOM, Sch Business Studies & Econ, Dodoma, Tanzania; [Mahoo, Henry; Saidia, Paul; Yustas, Yusto Mugisha; Silayo, Valerian; Kahimba, Frederick C.] SUA, Dept Agr Engn & Land Planning, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Kaburire, Laurent N.] SUA, Dev Studies Inst, Morogoro, Tanzania; [Makoko, Bashir] ARI, Ilonga, Tanzania; [Lambert, Christine] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Biol Chem & Nutr, Stuttgart, Germany; [Kimaro, Anthony] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, ICRAF Tanzania Country Programme, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Mutabazi, Khamaldin D.] SUA, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Morogoro, Tanzania";Graef, F (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Inst Land Use Syst, Muncheberg, Germany.;graef@zalf.de;"Konig, Hannes/I-1964-2012; Saidia, Paul/T-7189-2019";"Saidia, Paul/0000-0003-3332-5322; Hoffmann, Harry/0000-0003-3176-7709; Sieber, Stefan/0000-0002-4849-7277; Uckert, Gotz Bernhard/0000-0002-4359-5871; Konig, Hannes J./0000-0002-4980-7388; Fasse, Anja/0000-0002-7474-557X";"German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF)";This publication is a product of the Trans-SEC (www.trans-sec.org) project and Food Security Africa (FSA).

Nurses as family caregivers can draw on expert specific knowledge and nursing skills. Aim: To explore how family carers who are also trained nurses experience and deal with adverse events that occur during the care of their significant others. Method: As part of a larger research project using a sequential mixed methods design, 30 semi-structured interviews were conducted with health professionals, who were also family caregivers, of whom 20 were qualified nurses. All interviews were theoretically coded, dimensionalized and contextualized. Based on the nurses' data a model was developed. Results: The model illustrates the dilemma the interviewed nurses experienced when they need to deal with safety-relevant problems. As family caregivers with expert knowledge and skills, they were vigilant in surveilling the care provided. They were quick to identify risks and vulnerable points in the system of care being delivered. However, before taking action, they carefully considered the advantages and disadvantages of intervening, and also whether or not to admit that they were health care professionals. Conclusions: In the case of events relevant to the health and safety of their significant others, family carers who are trained nurses are most likely to use their expert knowledge, in situations with a perceived high risk to health, to minimise the potential harm.;"[Jaehnke, Anke; Liebert, Yvonne; Kaeppeli, Andrea; van Holten, Karin; Bischofberger, Iren] Kalaidos Fachhochschule, Forsch Inst, Careum Forsch, Dept Gesundheit, Pestalozzistr 3, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland";Jahnke, A (corresponding author), Kalaidos Fachhochschule, Forsch Inst, Careum Forsch, Dept Gesundheit, Pestalozzistr 3, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.;anke.jaehnke@careum.ch;;Jahnke, Anke/0000-0001-7227-0841;;;;30;2;2;1;4;VERLAG HANS HUBER;BERN 9;LANGGASS-STRASSE 76, CH-3000 BERN 9, SWITZERLAND;1012-5302;1664-283X;;PFLEGE;Pflege;DEC;2017;30;6;;;;;375;386;;10.1024/1012-5302/a000588;;;12;Nursing;Nursing;FT0ST;WOS:000422838900007;29171347;;;;2021-02-18;

The AeDES form is used to evaluate the safety conditions of buildings in order to enable people to return to their social and economic activities. The ReLUIS consortium has been heavily involved in the post-earthquake emergency phase of the central Italy earthquake. Consortium support to the Department of Civil Protection consisted of technical surveys of public buildings, with emphasis on school buildings, hospitals, strategic infrastructures, and sites with historical and monumental significance.

An important step to implement a jurimetric analysis is to extract raw data from courts and organize that data in a way that can be processed. Most of the raw data is unstructured and written in natural language, which stands as a challenge to Computer Science experts. As it requires expertise in law, statistics, and computer science, jurimetrics is a multidisciplinary field. When trying to implement a jurimetric system in Brazil, additional challenges were identified due to the heterogeneity of the different court systems, the lack of standards, and how the open data laws in Brazil are interpreted and implemented. In this article, we present a survey of Brazilian courts in terms of readiness to implement a jurimetric system. Analyzing a sample of data, we have found, in light of Brazil's open data regulation, privacy issues and technical issues. Finally, we propose a roadmap that encompasses both technology and public policy to meet those challenges.;"[Colombo, Bruna Armonas; Buck, Pedro] Univ Prebiteriana Mackenzie, Law Sch, BR-01302907 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Bezerra, Vinicius Miana] Univ Prebiteriana Mackenzie, Informat & Comp Dept, BR-01302907 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil";Bezerra, VM (corresponding author), Univ Prebiteriana Mackenzie, Informat & Comp Dept, BR-01302907 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.;"bruna.armonas@gmail.com; pedrobuck@gmail.com; vinicius@miana.com.br";Bezerra, Vinicius/C-5235-2013;"Bezerra, Vinicius/0000-0003-2325-6650; Buck, Pedro/0000-0002-7902-4376";;;;20;0;0;0;8;MDPI AG;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;1999-5903;;;FUTURE INTERNET;Future Internet;DEC;2017;9;4;;;;;;;68;10.3390/fi9040068;;;14;Computer Science, Information Systems;Computer Science;FS4RK;WOS:000419780100015;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-02-18;

Are there systematic differences in the perceptions of the quality and credibility of research derived from different sources? This is a replication of and expansion on Doberstein (2017), which presented a randomized controlled survey experiment using policy analysts to systematically test the source effects of policy research. Doberstein's experimental findings provide evidence for the hypothesis that academic research is perceived to be substantially more credible to government policy analysts than think tank or advocacy organization research, regardless of its content, and that sources perceived as more ideological are much less credible. This study replicates that experiment in three additional Canadian provincial governments to verify whether the relationship found in the original study persists in a larger sample and in conjunction with further randomization procedures. This study corroborates the original study's findings, confirming that external policy advice systems are subject to powerful heuristics that bureaucrats use to sift through evidence and advice.;[Doberstein, Carey] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, Kelowna, BC, Canada;Doberstein, C (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, Kelowna, BC, Canada.;;;;;;;44;1;1;1;20;CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY;GUELPH;UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA;0317-0861;;;CAN PUBLIC POL;Can.

Mammography remains today the best technology to detect breast cancer, early and efficiently, to distinguish between benign and malignant diseases. Several techniques in image processing and analysis have been developed to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a new solution to the problem of computer aided detection and interpretation for breast cancer. In the proposed approach, a Local Chan-Vese (LCV) model is used for the mass lesion segmentation step to isolate a suspected abnormality in a mammogram. In the classification step, we propose a two-step process: firstly, we use the hierarchical fuzzy partitioning (HFP) to construct fuzzy partitions from data, instead of using the only human information, available from expert knowledge, which are not sufficiently accurate and confronted to errors or inconsistencies. Secondly, fuzzy decision tree induction are proposed to extract classification knowledge from a set of feature-based examples. Fuzzy decision trees are first used to determine the class of the abnormality detected (well-defined mass, ill-defined mass, architectural distortion, or speculated masses), then, to identify the Severity of the abnormality, which can be benign or malignant. The proposed system is tested by using the images from Mammographic Image Analysis Society[MIAS] database. Experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed approach, resulting in an accuracy rate of 87, a sensitivity of 82.14%, and good specificity of 91.42%.;"[Boutaouche, F.; Benamrane, N.] Univ Sci & Technol Oran Mohamed BOUDIAF, Fac Math & Informat, Dept Informat, Lab SIMPA, BP 1505 El Mnaouer, Oran 31000, Algeria";Boutaouche, F (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol Oran Mohamed BOUDIAF, Fac Math & Informat, Dept Informat, Lab SIMPA, BP 1505 El Mnaouer, Oran 31000, Algeria.;"fouzia.boutaouche@univ-usto.dz; nacera.benamrane@univ-usto.dz";;;;;;40;0;0;0;3;UNIV SISTAN & BALUCHESTAN;ZAHEDAN;PO BOX 98135-987, ZAHEDAN, 00000, IRAN;1735-0654;;;IRAN J FUZZY SYST;Iran.

The system uses variable-order Markov models and rule induction to learn both temporal relations and structural relations between parts in a piece of music. As is usual in machine learning, however, the quality of the learning can be improved greatly by users specifying relevant features. The Agent Designer therefore points to important design and human-computer interaction problems, as well as algorithmic challenges. We present a number of studies that help to understand how effective the Agent Designer is and how we might design a user interface that best enables users to obtain quality results from the system. We show that the Agent Designer is effective for certain musical styles, such as loop-based electronic music, and that we as expert users can design agents that produce the most effective results.

In Pakistan, different actors-local and global-strive to facilitate the development of evidence-informed health policies. Effective involvement however, requires knowledge of the country-context, i.e. knowing the intricacies of how policies are formulated in Pakistan. Obtaining this knowledge is one of the key steps to making interventions impactful. aEuro integral We carried out a qualitative study to explore the environment of evidence-informed health policy in Pakistan. The study involved 89 participants and comprised three phases including: (1) literature review followed by a consultative meeting with key informants to explore the broad contours of policy formulation, (2) in-depth interviews with participants belonging to various levels of health system to discuss these contours and (3) a roundtable with experts to share and solidify the findings. aEuro integral Policy development is a slow, non-linear process with variable room for incorporation of evidence. Political actors dominate decisions that impact all aspects of policy, i.e. context, process and content. Research contributions are mostly influenced by the priorities of donor agencies-the usual proponents and sponsors of the generation of evidence. Since the devolution of health system in 2012, Pakistan's provinces continue to follow the same processes as before 2012, with little capacity to generate evidence and incorporate it into health policy. aEuro integral This study highlights the non-systematic, nearly ad hoc way of developing health policy in the country, overly dominated by political actors. Health advocates need to understand the policy process and the actors involved if they are to identify points of impact where their interaction with policy brings the maximum leverage. Moreover, an environment is needed where generation of data gains the importance it deserves and where capacities are enhanced for communicating and understanding evidence, as well as its incorporation into policy.;"[Haq, Zaeem] Johns Hopkins Ctr Commun Programs, Dept Hlth Behav & Soc, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Hafeez, Assad; Zafar, Shamsa] Hlth Serv Acad, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ghaffar, Abdul] World Hlth Org, Alliance Hlth Policy & Syst Res, Geneva, Switzerland";Haq, Z (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Ctr Commun Programs, 1st Floor,Razia Sharif Plaza Block 92, Islamabad, Pakistan.;drzaeem@hotmail.com;;Haq, Zaeem/0000-0003-4656-9879;"Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, World Health Organization; IRB";The study was supported through funds provided by the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, World Health Organization and IRB approved by Health Services Academy, Islamabad, Pakistan.;;36;3;3;0;4;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0268-1080;1460-2237;;HEALTH POLICY PLANN;Health Policy Plan.;DEC;2017;32;10;;;;;1449;1456;;10.1093/heapol/czx128;;;8;"Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services";Health Care Sciences & Services;FS1VC;WOS:000419565800013;29045672;Other Gold, Green Published;;;2021-02-18;

This study explores the intention of health professionals to use and recommend e-mental health applications and how they think these applications should be integrated in the national health system. Methods: We applied an exploratory sequential mixed-method research design. First, we collect and analyze responses from 131 health professionals in the field of pregnancy and maternal care. Based on these findings, we conduct semi-structured interviews with 16 experts to expand on the initial results. Results: Our study reveals that health professionals would in general intend to recommend and use e-mental health applications. However, their attitude towards e-mental health applications varies with respect to the coverage of the mental health process. Conclusion: The results are of relevance for research and practice. Two scenarios are described that show how health professionals perceive an introduction of e-mental health to be useful. (C) 2017 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

There is thus a tension between respecting the preferences of the people and making policy based on our best scientific knowledge. Deciding how to make policy in the light of this tension requires an understanding of why citizens sometimes disagree with the experts on what is risky and what is safe. In this paper, we examine two highly influential theories of how people form beliefs about risks: the theory that risk beliefs are errors caused by bounded rationality and the theory that such beliefs are part and parcel of people's core value systems. We then discuss the implications of the psychological theories for questions regarding liberal-democratic decision making:(1) Should policy be responsive to the preferences of citizens in the domain of risk regulation? (2) What risk-regulation policies are legitimate? (3) How should liberal-democratic deliberation be structured?;"[Christiansen, Andreas; Hallsson, Bjorn Gunnar] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Media Cognit & Commun, Copenhagen, Denmark";Christiansen, A (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Media Cognit & Commun, Copenhagen, Denmark.;;Christiansen, Andreas/AAU-5612-2020;"Christiansen, Andreas/0000-0001-7187-4520; Hallsson, Bjorn/0000-0001-7510-7329";;;;70;0;0;0;3;UNIV MONTREAL, FAC ARTS & SCIENCES;MONTREAL;SUCC CENTRE VILLE, C P 6128, MONTREAL, QC H3C 3J7, CANADA;1718-9977;;;ATELIERS ETHIQUE;Ateliers Ethique;WIN;2017;12;1;;;;;51;83;;;;;33;Ethics;Social Sciences - Other Topics;FR7XR;WOS:000419287500004;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-02-18;

Also, the existing gang-related variable likely underestimates the number of homicides that are associated with gang activity. This study utilizes NVDRS data to identify gang-like homicides which are not currently captured as gang-related. Methods: A set of criteria recommended by a panel of experts in gang violence, was applied to homicides collected in the NVDRS. These criteria, termed gang-like characteristics, were developed in order to better identify homicides consistent with gang activity. The narratives of the identified cases were then reviewed to refine the operational standard. After the reviews were complete, the typology was modified to finalize the operationalization of gang-like homicides. Results: A total of 481 gang-like homicides were identified using the gang-like criteria. This represents an increase of almost 69% over the 696 gang-related homicides captured in NVDRS dataset. Gang-like and gang-related homicides combined represented 6.6% of homicides that occurred from 2005 to 2008. Among the 16 states included in this analysis, Colorado (15.5%) and Oklahoma (14%) had the highest percentage of homicides that were either gang-related or gang-like. Maryland had the greatest relative increase (227.3%) between gang related and gang-like homicides. Conclusion: The new gang-like variable complements the existing gang-related variable by providing an automated, standardized way to identify homicides that have circumstances consistent with gang activity. This new variable might be useful to states and localities seeking an efficient way to monitor homicides potentially resulting from gang activity. Additional efforts are needed to standardize the reporting of homicides associated with gang activity.;"[Frazier, Leroy, Jr.] Centers Dis Control & Prevent, Div Violence Prevent, 4770 Buford Hwy, Buford Hwy, NE 4770 USA; [Ortega, LaVonne] Centers Dis Control & Prevent, Sci Educ & Program, Dev Off, Off Surveillance Epidemiol & Lab Sci, 2400 Century Ctr,Mailstop E-92, Atlanta, GA 30345 USA; [Patel, Nimeshkumar] SPEB, DARPI, NCIPC, CDC, 4770 Buford Highway NE.,Mailstop F64, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA; [Barnes, Jamar; Crosby, Alex E.] Natl Ctr Injury Prevent & Control, Centers Dis Control & Prevent, Div Violence Prevent, 4770 Buford Hwy NE,MS F-63, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA; [Hempstead, Katherine] Robert Wood Johnson Fdn, Route 1 & Coll Rd East,POB 2316, Princeton, NJ 08543 USA";Crosby, AE (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Injury Prevent & Control, Centers Dis Control & Prevent, Div Violence Prevent, 4770 Buford Hwy NE,MS F-63, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA.;aec1@cdc.gov;;;Intramural CDC HHS [CC999999] Funding Source: Medline;;;20;1;1;0;3;NATL MED ASSOC;WASHINGON;1012 10TH ST, N W, WASHINGON, DC 20001 USA;0027-9684;1943-4693;;J NATL MED ASSOC;J.

The aims of this research were to: (i) optimize the fermentation parameters via solid state fermentation (SSF); and (ii) study the performance in hydrolysis and esterification processes of the one-step partially purified Schizophyllum commune UTARA1 lipases. Lipase was produced by cultivating S. commune UTARA1 on sugarcane bagasse (SB) with used cooking oil (UCO) via SSF and its production was optimized using Design-Expert (R) 7.0.0. Fractions 30% (ScLipA) and 70% (ScLipB) which contained high lipase activity were obtained by stepwise (NH4)(2)SO4 precipitation. Crude fish oil, coconut oil and butter were used to investigate the lipase hydrolysis capabilities by a free glycerol assay. Results showed that ScLipA has affinities for long, medium and short chain triglycerides, as all the oils investigated were degraded, whereas ScLipB has affinities for long chain triglycerides as it only degrades crude fish oil. During esterification, ScLipA was able to synthesize trilaurin and triacetin. Conversely, ScLipB was specific towards the formation of 2-mono-olein and triacetin. From the results obtained, it was determined that ScLipA and ScLipB are sn-2 regioselective lipases. Hence, the one-step partial purification strategy proved to be feasible for partial purification of S. commune UTARA1 lipases that has potential use in industrial applications.";"[Kam, Yew Chee; Ong, Lisa Gaik Ai] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Dept Biol Sci, Fac Sci, Kampar 31900, Malaysia; [Woo, Kwan Kit] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Chem Engn, Kajang 43000, Malaysia";Ong, LGA (corresponding author), Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Dept Biol Sci, Fac Sci, Kampar 31900, Malaysia.;"kamyc@utar.edu.my; wookk@utar.edu.my; ongga@utar.edu.my";"Woo, K.K/ABB-6336-2020; Ong, Lisa G A/F-4109-2012";Ong, Lisa G A/0000-0001-6855-7364;Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE)Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR) [FRGS/1/10/SG/UTAR/03/9];The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) for the FRGS Fasa 1/2010 Project (FRGS/1/10/SG/UTAR/03/9) for the support of this research.;;24;0;0;0;6;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1420-3049;;MOLECULES;Molecules;DEC;2017;22;12;;;;;;;2106;10.3390/molecules22122106;;;13;"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary";"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry";FR7IW;WOS:000419242400075;29292721;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-02-18;

A conceptual extension of Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) and its formalization have been proposed and used to model UTS complexity. The scope is to identify the system functions and their interdependencies with a particular focus on those that have a relation and impact on people and communities. Network analysis techniques have been applied to the FRAM model to identify and estimate the most critical community-related functions. The notion of Variability Rate (VR) has been defined as the amount of output variability generated by an upstream function that can be tolerated/absorbed by a downstream function, without significantly increasing of its subsequent output variability. A fuzzy-based quantification of the VR based on expert judgment has been developed when quantitative data are not available. Our approach has been applied to a critical scenario as flash flooding considering two cases: when UTS has CC and IoE implemented or not. However, the method can be applied in different scenarios and critical infrastructures.

The use of IoT for continuous monitoring of public health is being rapidly adopted by various countries while generating a massive volume of heterogeneous, multisource, dynamic, and sparse high-velocity data. Handling such an enormous amount of high-speed medical data while integrating, collecting, processing, analyzing, and extracting knowledge constitutes a challenging task. On the other hand, most of the existing IoT devices do not cooperate with one another by using the same medium of communication. For this reason, it is a challenging task to develop healthcare applications for IoT that fulfill all user needs through real-time monitoring of health parameters. Therefore, to address such issues, this article proposed a Hadoop-based intelligent care system (HICS) that demonstrates IoT-based collaborative contextual Big Data sharing among all of the devices in a healthcare system. In particular, the proposed system involves a network architecture with enhanced processing features for data collection generated by millions of connected devices. In the proposed system, various sensors, such as wearable devices, are attached to the human body and measure health parameters and transmit them to a primary mobile device (PMD). The collected data are then forwarded to intelligent building (IB) using the Internet where the data are thoroughly analyzed to identify abnormal and serious health conditions. Intelligent building consists of (1) a Big Data collection unit (used for data collection, filtration, and load balancing); (2) a Hadoop processing unit (HPU) (composed of Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) and MapReduce); and (3) an analysis and decision unit. The HPU, analysis, and decision unit are equipped with a medical expert system, which reads the sensor data and performs actions in the case of an emergency situation. To demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system, we use publicly available medical sensory datasets and real-time sensor traffic while identifying the serious health conditions of patients by using thresholds, statistical methods, and machine-learning techniques. The results show that the proposed system is very efficient and able to process high-speed WBAN sensory data in real time.";"[Rathore, M.

This paper presents a fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis for the development of a combined spatial decision support system (CSDSS) allowing the selection of potential water catchment drilling sites in the plateau of Mostaganem in the north-west of Algeria. For this purpose, our approach includes two steps: in the first step, we use thematic maps and a set of criteria (geological, hydrological, topographical, environmental, etc.) in geographic information system (GIS) to select the potential water drilling sites. In this step, 14 sites are selected. The evaluation of the experts of each potential site, versus to the various criteria, is imprecise during this first step. Their modelling by linguistic variables and fuzzy numbers is necessary. So that, a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) method is applied in the second step for ranking the potential water catchment drilling sites. Based on an initial GIS screening and final FMCDM assessment, site14, site8 and site13 are selected as the top three sites. Research results show that the combination between GIS and FMCDM allows to define a powerful CSDSS. A robustness analysis, using a Monte Carlo simulation, was performed to estimate the consistency of the potential site ranking. The results show that site14 is still the most suitable for water drilling with a 100% of reliability.;"[Boukrentach, Hafida; Benali, Abdelmadjid] Univ Oran2 Mohamed Ben Ahmed, Fac Earth Sci Geog & Terr Dev, Dept Earth Sci & Universe, BP 1015, El Mnaouer 31000, Oran, Algeria; [Dekkiche, Hicham] Space Tech Ctr, Dept Space Geodesy, BP 13, Arzew, Oran, Algeria";Boukrentach, H (corresponding author), Univ Oran2 Mohamed Ben Ahmed, Fac Earth Sci Geog & Terr Dev, Dept Earth Sci & Universe, BP 1015, El Mnaouer 31000, Oran, Algeria.;hboukrentach@yahoo.fr;;;;;;53;2;2;0;6;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1866-7511;1866-7538;;ARAB J GEOSCI;Arab.

Population growth, poverty, climate variability, and low agricultural productivity, among others, are threatening food provision. Rural areas in West Africa are particularly vulnerable due to low financial and physical capacity and high dependency on agriculture. Programs to support food provision exist, but their effects bear uncertainties under different weather and land use scenarios. Our study focuses on the regional assessment of food provision in the Upper East Region in northern Ghana under land use changes and different weather scenarios by using a Bayesian Belief Network. Especially in the beginning of the rainy season, there is a high risk of food insecurity. Therefore, seasonality needs to be considered in a modeling approach. In addition, we estimated the vitamin A supply indicating the risk of malnutrition. Improving agricultural programs, increasing income by off-farm activities, reducing post-harvest loss, reducing soil erosion, expanding irrigated areas in the dry season and increasing market demand were assessed in order to support food security. The Bayesian Belief Network specifically handles uncertainty and different data types and allows the visualization of complex socio-ecological interactions to communicate to different expert groups, mainly scientists and field officers. A combination of literature, calculations and expert knowledge was required to fill the knowledge gaps in the West African context. About 95 experts were involved in the Bayesian Belief Network development process. An important finding was that an increase in household income, for example by off-farm income, might be better support for people than agricultural programs for providing a contribution to food security under weather uncertainty, provided that income is partly spent on fertilizer. The same is true under increasing population and decreasing total cropland. The likelihood of food provision in the following rainy season was 15% to 55% lower than in the dry season. In addition, the vitamin A provision was far below the demand in all scenarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this paper is to assess the method by which this is achieved within the EU-funded project Welfare Quality((R)) (WQ). According to the protocols of WQ, individual animals with welfare problems contribute disproportionately more to a lower animal welfare score when they are associated with farms with an otherwise low prevalence of welfare problems compared to farms with a higher prevalence. As a consequence, the addition of a single lame cow on a farm with relatively few lame cows will have a greater consequence for the welfare score than on a farm with more lame cows. The stated aim of this aspect of the protocols is to prevent welfare problems being masked as a result of attaining better scores in other areas. By combining a case study of 44 Danish dairy farms and a questionnaire study of over 150 animal welfare experts, we test whether the system successfully prevents masking of problems that experts find to be unacceptable. Our findings indicate that this is not the case, and we conclude that better methods of summarizing farm-level animal welfare measures are required. Abstract Welfare Quality((R)) proposes a system for aggregation according to which the total welfare score for a group of animals is a non-linear effect of the prevalence of welfare scores across the individuals within the group. Three assumptions serve to justify this: (1) experts do not follow a linear reasoning when they assess a welfare problem; (2) it serves to prevent compensation (severe welfare problems hidden by scoring well on other aspects of welfare); (3) experts agree on the weight of different welfare measures. We use two sources of data to examine these assumptions: animal welfare data from 44 Danish dairy farms with Danish Holstein Friesian cows, and data from a questionnaire study with a convenience sample of 307 experts in animal welfare, of which we received responses from over 50%. Our main results were: (1) the total group-level welfare score as assigned by experts is a non-linear function of the individual animal welfare states within the group; (2) the WQ system does not prevent what experts perceive as unacceptable compensation; (3) the level of agreement among experts appears to vary across measures. Our findings give rise to concerns about the proposed aggregation system offered by WQ.";"[Sandoe, Peter; Forkman, Bjorn; Hakansson, Franziska; Andreasen, Sine Norlander; Denwood, Matt] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Vet & Anim Sci, DK-1870 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Sandoe, Peter; Nohr, Rikke; Lund, Thomas Boker] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark";"Sandoe, P (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Vet & Anim Sci, DK-1870 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.; Sandoe, P (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.";"pes@sund.ku.dk; bjf@sund.ku.dk; fh@sund.ku.dk; sinora@live.dk; rinohr79@gmail.com; md@sund.ku.dk; tblu@ifro.ku.dk";"Sandoe, Peter/E-8758-2015; Lund, Thomas/E-4584-2015";"Sandoe, Peter/0000-0003-0397-3273; Lund, Thomas/0000-0001-5282-1562; Forkman, Bjorn/0000-0002-0153-6240";Danish Veterinary and Food Administration;Thanks are due to the experts who filled out the questionnaire on which the expert study is based and to the Danish dairy farmers who allowed us to undertake welfare assessment on their farms.

Fuzzy logic emulates the human reasoning in the use of imprecise information to generate decisions. Unlike traditional approaches, which require a mathematical understanding of the system, fuzzy logic comprises an alternative way of processing, which permits modeling complex systems through the use of human knowledge. On the other hand, several new metaheuristic algorithms have recently been proposed with interesting results. Most of them use operators based on metaphors of natural or social elements to evolve candidate solutions. In this paper, a methodology to implement human-knowledge-based optimization strategies is presented. In the scheme, a Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy inference system is used to reproduce a specific search strategy generated by a human expert. Therefore, the number of rules and its configuration only depend on the expert experience without considering any learning rule process. Under these conditions, each fuzzy rule represents an expert observation that models the conditions under which candidate solutions are modified in order to reach the optimal location. To exhibit the performance and robustness of the proposed method, a comparison to other well-known optimization methods is conducted. The comparison considers several standard benchmark functions which are typically found in scientific literature. The results suggest a high performance of the proposed methodology.

Here, we describe a consensus-based approach to develop a measurement framework and identify a core set of indicators for monitoring facility-based KMC that would be feasible to measure within existing systems. Methods The KMC measurement framework and core list of indicators were developed through: 1) scoping exercise to identify potential indicators through literature review and requests from researchers and program implementers; and 2) face-to-face consultations with KMC and measurement experts working at country and global levels to review candidate indicators and finalize selection and definitions. Results The KMC measurement framework includes two main components: 1) service readiness, based on the WHO building blocks framework; and 2) service delivery action sequence covering identification, service initiation, continuation to discharge, and follow-up to graduation. Consensus was reached on 10 core indicators for KMC, which were organized according to the measurement framework. We identified 4 service readiness indicators, capturing national level policy for KMC, availability of KMC indicators in HMIS, costed operational plans for KMC and availability of KMC services at health facilities with inpatient maternity services. Six indicators were defined for service delivery, including weighing of babies at birth, identification of those <= 2000 g, initiation of facility-based KMC, monitoring the quality of KMC, status of babies at discharge from the facility and levels of follow-up (according to country-specific protocol). Conclusions These core KMC indicators, identified with input from a wide range of global and country-level KMC and measurement experts, can aid efforts to strengthen monitoring systems and facilitate global tracking of KMC implementation. As data collection systems advance, we encourage program managers and evaluators to document their experiences using this framework to measure progress and allow indicator refinement, with the overall aim of working towards sustainable, country-led data systems.";"[Guenther, Tanya; Valsangkar, Bina; Wetzel, Greta; Kerber, Kate] Save Children, 899 North Capitol St NE,Suite 900, Washington, DC 20002 USA; [Moxon, Sarah; Blencowe, Hannah] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England; [Ruiz, Juan] Kangaroo Mother Care Fdn, Bogota, Colombia; [Ruiz, Juan] FIU, Herbert Wertheim Coll Med, Miami, FL USA; [Dube, Queen] Queen Elizabeth Cent Hosp, Blantyre, Malawi; [Vani, Shashi N.] Kangaroo Mother Care Fdn, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Vivio, Donna] USAID, Washington, DC USA; [Magge, Hema] Partners Hlth, Kigali, Rwanda; [Magge, Hema] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Global Hlth Equ, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [De Leon-Mendoza, Socorro] Bless Tetada Kangaroo Mother Care Fdn, Manila, Philippines; [Patterson, Janna] Bill & Melinda Gates Fdn, Seattle, WA USA; [Mazia, Goldy] PATH, Washington, DC USA; [Mazia, Goldy] Maternal & Child Survival Programme, Washington, DC USA";Guenther, T (corresponding author), Save Children, 899 North Capitol St NE,Suite 900, Washington, DC 20002 USA.;tguenther@savechildren.org;;Blencowe, Hannah/0000-0003-1556-3159;Save the Children - Saving Newborn Lives;Funding for this work was provided by Save the Children - Saving Newborn Lives.;;21;2;2;0;3;UNIV EDINBURGH, GLOBAL HEALTH SOC;EDINBURGH;CENTRE POPULATION HEALTH SCIENCES, OLD MEDICAL SCH, TEVIOT PL, EDINBURGH, EH8 9AG, SCOTLAND;2047-2978;2047-2986;;J GLOB HEALTH;J.

While questions on the warning system technology and the distribution of information, including the alarm for evacuation, could be resolved with the support of experts, controversies arose on the financial and legal responsibilities that ensure long-term and effective monitoring for the protection of the landslide-prone community. This paper examines how responsibilities can be shared among the residents, experts, and public authorities during the design and operation of landslide warning systems. In particular, we discuss the outcome and implications of three stakeholder workshops where participants deliberated on warning-system options that, in turn, were based on a discourse analysis of extensive stakeholder interviews. The results of the case study show that an end-user orientation requires the consideration of stakeholder worldviews, interests, and conflicts. Paradoxically, the public did not fully support their own involvement in the maintenance and control of the warning system, but the authorities promoted shared responsibility. Deliberative planning does not then necessarily lead to responsibility sharing, but it proved effective as a platform for information and for shared ownership in the warning system.;"[Preuner, Philipp; Bayer, JoAnne Linnerooth] IIASA, Risk & Resilience Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Scolobig, Anna] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Climate Policy Grp, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ottowitz, David; Hoyer, Stefan; Jochum, Birgit] GSA, Dept Geophys, A-1030 Vienna, Austria";Preuner, P (corresponding author), IIASA, Risk & Resilience Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.;"preuner@iiasa.ac.at; anna.scolobig@usys.ethz.ch; bayer@iiasa.ac.at; david.ottowitz@geologie.ac.at; stefan.hoyer@geologie.ac.at; birgit.jochum@geologie.ac.at";;;Austrian Academy of Sciences' international research initiative Earth System Science (ESS);The work described in this publication was supported by the Austrian Academy of Sciences' international research initiative Earth System Science (ESS) through the grant to the budget of the LAMOND Project.

A housing project can be regarded as sustainable only when all the dimensions of sustainability (environmental, economic, and social) are dealt with. There has been an increased interest in using sustainability indicators for evaluating the impacts of the new development projects. Although international literature is rich in sustainability assessments, there are no tools developed for assessment of new residential projects in the specific context of the Baltic States. Therefore, the aim of this article is to fill this gap and to propose an integrated, hierarchically structured system of sustainability indicators to be used for assessment of the new housing development projects. This aim is achieved through accomplishing three objectives. First, based on a review of literature related to assessing building project performance and sustainable development in construction, the paper proposes an original hierarchically structured system of sustainability indicators suitable for the Baltic context. Second, based on a survey of experts, significances of criteria are estimated by the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. Finally, paper proposes recommendations to government authorities and real estate developers as to how to enhance the performance of new residential projects according to the principles of sustainability.;"[Tupenaite, Laura] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Lill, Irene] Tallinn Univ Technol, Sch Engn, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Geipele, Ineta] Riga Tech Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Real Estate Management, 6 Kalnciema Str, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia; [Naimaviciene, Jurga] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania";Tupenaite, L (corresponding author), Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Construct Management & Real Estate, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.;"laura.tupenaite@vgtu.lt; irene.lill@ttu.ee; ineta.geipele@rtu.lv; jurga.naimaviciene@vgtu.lt";Lill, Irene/D-3205-2011;Lill, Irene/0000-0003-3178-1455;Estonian Ministry of Education and ResearchMinistry of Education and Research, Estonia [IUT1-15];This work was partly supported by institutional research funding of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research IUT1-15 Nearly-zero energy solutions and their implementation on deep renovation of buildings.;;66;13;13;2;14;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2079-9276;;RESOURCES-BASEL;Resources-Basel;DEC;2017;6;4;;;;;;;55;10.3390/resources6040055;;;21;Green & Sustainable Science & Technology;Science & Technology - Other Topics;FR7CS;WOS:000419224500008;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-02-18;

This problem demands interdisciplinary approaches which includes cooperation of experts and scientists from different Fields such as medicine, sociology, psychology, math and statistics. Random phenomena are a subject of study by mathematical statistics. In this paper we made a statistical model for large game series in sports betting. It is shown that possibility for winning in that type of series is almost negligible for betters. Analyses that are exposed in this paper shatter the illusion of quick money from sports betting. Therefore, the mathematical knowledge of sports betting should be included in the general education of society through specialized workshops on betting and gambling, for their effective prevention. We think that some results of this study would be useful to include in the treatment of addiction rehabilitation groups of pathological gambling addicts in order to reduce their will for gambling as possible source of quick income.

Many traditional approaches require experienced designers to manually specify the formulization of the approximating function, leading to the rigid, non-adaptive representation of the value function. To address this problem, a novel Q-value function approximation method named 'Hierarchical fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory' (HiART) is proposed in this paper. HiART is based on the Fuzzy ART method and is an adaptive classification network that learns to segment the state space by classifying the training input automatically. HiART begins with a highly generalized structure where the number of the category nodes is limited, which is beneficial to speed up the learning process at the early stage. Then, the network is refined gradually by creating the attached sub-networks, and a layered network structure is formed during this process. Based on this adaptive structure, HiART alleviates the dependence on expert experience to design the network parameter. The effectiveness and adaptivity of HiART are demonstrated in the Mountain Car benchmark problem with both fast learning speed and low computation time. Finally, a simulation application example of the one versus one air combat decision problem illustrates the applicability of HiART.;"[Zhou, Yanan; Ma, Yaofei; Song, Xiao; Gong, Guanghong] Beihang Univ, Sch Automat Sci & Elect Engn, Xue Yuan Rd 37, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China";Ma, YF (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Sch Automat Sci & Elect Engn, Xue Yuan Rd 37, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.;mayaofeibuaa@163.com;;;;;;37;2;2;0;3;WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD;SINGAPORE;5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE;1793-9623;1793-9615;;INT J MODEL SIMUL SC;Int.

Additionally, in early 2016, a Delegated Act (DA) related to the FMD was published. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of external audits in the context of implementing new regulations provided by the FMD in the secondary care environment. Methods: The external, in-person workflow audits were performed by an authentication company in three Polish hospital pharmacies. Each audit consisted of a combination of supervision (non-participant observation), secondary data analysis, and expert interviews with the use of an independently designed authorial Diagnostic Questionnaire. The questionnaire included information about hospital drug distribution procedures, data concerning drug usage, IT systems, medication order systems, the processes of medication dispensing, and the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs. Data analysis included a thorough examination of hospital documentation in regard to drug management. All data were subjected to qualitative analysis, with the aim of generating meaningful information through inductive inference. Results: Only one dispensing location in the Polish hospitals studied has the potential to be a primary authentication area. In the audited hospitals, an Automated Drug Dispensing System and unit dose were not identified during the study. Hospital wards contained an enclosed place within the department dedicated to drug storage under the direct supervision of senior nursing staff. An electronic order system was not available. In the largest center, unused medications are re-dispensed to different hospital departments, or may be sold to various institutions. Additionally, in one hospital pharmacy, pharmacists prepared parenteral nutrition and chemotherapeutic drugs for patients admitted to the hospital.

Throughout the Architecture, Engineering, Construction/Facility Management (AEC/FM) industry, length measurements vary from large-scale applications such as measuring distances between cities to small-scale applications such as measuring the depth of a crack or width of a welded joint. Within the last two decades, advances in applying new technologies have resulted in emerging new measuring devices such as ultrasound- and laser-based measurers. Considering the diversity of these devices in terms of associated costs, ease of use and levels of accuracy, the selection of an optimal measuring technology is a challenging task for construction engineers and facility managers. To tackle this issue, the authors present a thorough literature review on various measuring technologies adopted by experts in the area of AEC/FM. In the next step, and in order to evaluate the performance of these technologies, a number of real built infrastructure settings were chosen as case studies and multiple length measurements were conducted by implementing six common categories of technologies: tapes, total stations, laser measurers, ultrasound devices, laser scanners and image-based technologies. Finally, performance of various devices was compared and evaluated considering several comparison factors including the required time for operating and training, ease of use, level of accuracy and associated costs.;"[Rashidi, Abbas] Univ Utah, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Maghiar, Marcel] Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Construct Management, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Sigari, Mohamad Hoseyn] Quchan Univ Adv Technol, Dept Comp Engn, Quchan 94771, Iran";Rashidi, A (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.;abbas.rashidi@utah.edu;Sigari, Mohamad-Hoseyn/AAV-8499-2020;Sigari, Mohamad-Hoseyn/0000-0003-4048-2262;;;;50;5;5;0;7;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;2228-6160;2364-1843;;IJST-T CIV ENG;Iran.

Rather than re-evaluate the role of international organizations such as the United Nations, they focused their attention on the Congress of Vienna. What those experts saw, in the model of the Congress, was an alternative to the resolute unilateral attitude adopted by the American superpower in managing some regional crises (e.g. the First Gulf War and the collapse of Yugoslavia). According to some, the idea that an international order for Governing the World (Mark Mazower) should be established, originated during the Conference of Vienna. This essay examines the recent Anglo-Saxon debate on the Congress of Vienna as the antecedent of the system of summits and conferences (G8, G20) and of multilateral partnerships.;[Di Gregorio, Pinella] Univ Catania, Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociali, Via Vittorio Emanuele 49, Catania, Italy;Di Gregorio, P (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociali, Via Vittorio Emanuele 49, Catania, Italy.;digregor@unict.it;;;;;;46;0;0;0;2;SOC ED IL MULINO;BOLOGNA;STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY;1120-9526;;;RIC STOR POLTICA;Ric.

Research suggests that participation in community gardens improves access to fresh, healthy foods and increases fruit and vegetable consumption. In addition to these physical benefits, research also documents a variety of social and communal benefits, by expanding social capital, stabilizing neighbor-hoods, and cultivating relationships. Unfortunately, most of these studies focus on a specific case, cross case, or intervention studies within a geographically specific locale. Learning lessons from successful community garden programs can be difficult because community gardens often rely on the synergy of a complex network of support agencies that assist in various technical and educational capacities. The purpose of the study was to demonstrate the use of a framework for program development and evaluation that stakeholders, including extension, can adopt to show program outcomes. The framework used a Delphi approach with a diverse panel of community garden stakeholders to reach consensus about program outcomes. The study demonstrated that the panel could reach consensus on a variety of short-, medium-, and long-term outcomes.;"[Diaz, John; Webb, Susan; Warner, Laura; Monoghan, Paul] Univ Florida, Dept Agr Educ & Commun, 305 Rolfs Hall,POB 110540, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA";Diaz, J (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Agr Educ & Commun, 305 Rolfs Hall,POB 110540, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.;john.diaz@ufl.edu;;Warner, Laura/0000-0003-2784-6666;;;;30;0;0;1;20;AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE;ALEXANDRIA;113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA;1063-0198;1943-7714;;HORTTECHNOLOGY;HortTechnology;DEC;2017;27;6;;;;;852;859;;10.21273/HORTTECH03848-17;;;8;Horticulture;Agriculture;FR0ER;WOS:000418734700017;;Bronze;;;2021-02-18;

CNB provides a definitive diagnosis in most cases, but it sometimes may be inconclusive. CNB has the advantage of enabling a histologic examination in relation to the surrounding thyroid tissue, immunohistochemistry, and molecular testing that can provide a more accurate assessment than FNA in selected cases. Nevertheless, CNB should be performed only by experienced experts in thyroid interventions to prevent complications because CNB needles are larger in caliber than FNA needles. As recent evidence has accumulated, and with improvements in the technique and devices for thyroid CNB, the Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology released its 2016 thyroid CNB guidelines and the Korean Endocrine Pathology Thyroid Core Needle Biopsy Study Group published a consensus statement on the pathology reporting system for thyroid CNB in 2015.

A complex and complication prone procedure such as percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) with a steep learning curve may create an unsafe environment for hands-on resident training. In this study, we validate a high fidelity, inanimate PCNL model within a full-immersion simulation environment. Methods: Anatomically correct models of the human pelvicaliceal system, kidney, and relevant adjacent structures were created using polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels and three-dimensional-printed injection molds. All steps of a PCNL were simulated including percutaneous renal access, nephroscopy, and lithotripsy. Five experts (>100 caseload) and 10 novices (<20 caseload) from both urology (full procedure) and interventional radiology (access only) departments completed the simulation. Face and content validity were calculated using model ratings for similarity to the real procedure and usefulness as a training tool. Differences in performance among groups with various levels of experience using clinically relevant procedural metrics were used to calculate construct validity. Results: The model was determined to have an excellent face and content validity with an average score of 4.5/5.0 and 4.6/5.0, respectively. There were significant differences between novice and expert operative metrics including mean fluoroscopy time, the number of percutaneous access attempts, and number of times the needle was repositioned. Experts achieved better stone clearance with fewer procedural complications. Conclusions: We demonstrated the face, content, and construct validity of an inanimate, full task trainer for PCNL.

Previous research has introduced models based on empirical and mechanical analyses to predict the behavior of infrastructure considering climate change. However, the uncertainty and unavailability of information regarding climate change prevent the widespread use of these previous models. This paper presents a method for developing a climate impact-assessment system using fuzzy inferences to predict the alteration of infrastructure service life. Fuzzy inferences enable an understanding of the impacts of climate on infrastructure, with expert knowledge reflecting the interactions between multiple environmental factors. Based on the proposed method, the impacts of climate change on infrastructure can be analyzed by obtaining an expected service life with respect to various climate scenarios. A case study was conducted on a flexible pavement road in Alabama to show the applicability and utility of the method. The proposed method is expected to improve infrastructure management and planning practices, establishing proactive adaptation strategies to minimize additional infrastructure expenditure and damage.

J;Moore, CRK;;;;Moore, Christopher Robertson Kinley;;;Oil and gas contracts utilizing R Factors and rates of return: theory and practice;JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW & BUSINESS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;Oil and gas contracts with fiscal terms that respond to direct measures of contractor profitability have been in use since the early 1980s. Rate of return systems were used in a limited number of jurisdictions. Systems based on some ratio of revenues to costs (R Factors) have been used more widely, perhaps because of their simpler mathematics. Both types of systems have been criticized by experts and host governments alike because of their susceptibility to manipulation and the belief that they encourage contractors to spend unnecessarily to maintain contractor share. The opportunity to manipulate the calculations is not related to tine use of profitability measures, but rather exists where there are extreme variations in government take, exacerbated by the variation occurring as stair steps, rather than continuous functions. Opportunities for significant manipulation are likely to be infrequent, arising only when specific boundary conditions are approached. Moreover, it seems unlikely that any such manipulatory behaviour would pass the scrutiny of the State's representatives on the management committee or similar body, whose approval would be required under a typical PSC. ROR or R Factor systems can be made much less susceptible to manipulation (i) by using continuous functions rather than stair steps, (ii) for R Factors, by using ratios that are insensitive to operating costs, which are easier to manipulate in the production phase than development costs, and (iii) by using functions with relatively low slopes, ie avoiding very large changes in shares for any small change in profitability metric. Strategic gold-plating, the conscious decision made (at project sanction) to over-spend to retain a higher contractor share of production, is unlikely to be carried out by a prudent contractor. This is because its decisions are based on maximizing net present value and, more importantly, investment efficiency. Moreover, once the decision is made, the project performance will depend on unpredictable future product prices. Compared to results without gold-plating, after gold-plating the reduction in value if prices are lower than predicted is much larger than the gains if prices are higher. This again provides a powerful disincentive for gold-plating.;"[Moore, Christopher Robertson Kinley] Moyes & Co Inc, Dallas, TX 75225 USA; [Moore, Christopher Robertson Kinley] Univ Texas Sch Law, Austin, TX 78705 USA";"Moore, CRK (corresponding author), Moyes & Co Inc, Dallas, TX 75225 USA.; Moore, CRK (corresponding author), Univ Texas Sch Law, Austin, TX 78705 USA.";;;;;;;11;1;1;1;4;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1754-9957;1754-9965;;J WORLD ENERGY LAW B;J.

The Healthy Start (HS) program was created to address factors that contribute to high infant mortality rates (IMRs) and persistent disparities in IMRs. The program began in 1991 and was transformed in 2014 to apply lessons from emerging research, past evaluation findings, and expert recommendations. To understand the implementation and impact of the transformed program, there is a need for a robust and comprehensive evaluation. Description The national HS evaluation will include an implementation evaluation, which will describe program components that affect outcomes; a utilization evaluation, which will examine the characteristics of women and infants who did and did not utilize the program; and an outcome evaluation, which will assess the program's effectiveness with regard to producing expected outcomes among the target population. Data sources include the National HS Program Survey, a HS participant survey, and individual-level program data linked to vital records and the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) survey. Assessment Descriptive analyses will be used to examine differences in risk profiles between participants and non-participants, as well as to calculate penetration rates for high-risk women in respective service areas. Multivariable analyses will be used to determine the impact of the program on key outcomes and will explore variation by dose, type of services received, and grantee characteristics.

Chloroquine directly excites peripheral sensory neurons which convey itch signals to the central nervous system. It has been revealed that ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K-ATP channels) are important in regulating neuronal excitability. Thus, we aimed to investigate the involvement of K-ATP channels in CQ-induced itch which may also reveal a linkage between metabolic state of cells and itch. Methods: Intradermal (id) injection of CQ at dose of 400 mg/site induces the scratching behavior. K-ATP channel openers, diazoxide (DZX) and minoxidil (MIN), and a K-ATP channel blocker, glibenclamide (GLI), were administered intraperitoneally (ip) before CQ. Then the behavior was recorded for 30 min, in an unmanned condition, and the scratching bouts were counted by an expert observer who was blinded to the experiments. Furthermore, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to investigate the possible changes in dermal expression of Kcnj8 and Kcnj11, the genes encoding the K-ATP channels. Results: Our results show that either DZX (10 mg/kg, ip) or MIN (10 mg/kg, ip) significantly attenuated CQ-induced scratching behavior in mice. Moreover, pretreatment with GLI (3 mg/kg, ip) significantly reversed the anti-pruritic effects of DZX and MIN. Our finding of qRT-PCR analysis also show that the expression of Kcnj8 is decreased after CQ injection. Conclusions: We suggest that K-ATP channels are possibly involved in CQ-induced itch. While, further studies will be significant to better elucidate the association of metabolic state of cells and itch.

The aim is to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity, now and in the future. Sources of data: The UN has established web-sites to inform the implementation of the SDGs and an Inter-Agency and Expert Group on an Indicator Framework. We have searched for independent commentaries and analysis. Areas of agreement: The goals represent a framework that is scientifically robust, and widely intuitive intended to build upon the progress established by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). There is a need for system wide strategic planning to integrate the economic, social and environmental dimensions into policy and actions. Areas of controversy: Many countries have yet to understand the difference between the MDGs and the SDGs, particularly their universality, the huge potential of new data methods to help with their implementation, and the systems thinking that is needed to deliver the vision. The danger is that individual goals may be prioritized without an understanding of the potential positive interactions between goals. Growing points: There is an increasing understanding that sustainable development needs a paradigm shift in our understanding of the interaction between the real economy and quality of life. There would be many social, environmental and economic benefits in changing our current model. Areas timely for developing research: We need to develop systems wide understanding of what supports a healthy environment and the art and science of making change.;"[Morton, Stephen] Publ Hlth England, Sustainabil & Publ Hlth Benefits, London, England; [Pencheon, David] Sustainable Dev Unit NHS England, Cambridge, England; [Pencheon, David] Publ Hlth England, London, England; [Squires, Neil] Publ Hlth England, Global Publ Hlth, London, England";Morton, S (corresponding author), Publ Hlth England, Sustainabil & Publ Hlth Benefits, London, England.;stevemorton@doctors.org.uk;;Morton, William Stephen/0000-0001-7122-0201;;;;22;32;32;2;34;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0007-1420;1471-8391;;BRIT MED BULL;Br.

The Canadian Partnership Against Cancer manages the OncoSim program, with funding from Health Canada and model development by Statistics Canada. Microsimulation modelling allows for the detailed capture of population heterogeneity and health and demographic history over time. Extensive data from multiple Canadian sources were used as inputs or to validate the model. OncoSim has been validated through expert consultation; assessments of face validity, internal validity, and external validity; and model fit against observed data. The platform comprises three in-depth cancer models (lung, colorectal, cervical), with another in-depth model (breast) and a generalized model (25 cancers) being in development. Unique among models of its class, OncoSim is available online for public sector use free of charge. Users can customize input values and output display, and extensive user support is provided. OncoSim has been used to support decision-making at the national and jurisdictional levels. Although simulation studies are generally not included in hierarchies of evidence, they are integral to informing cancer control policy when clinical studies are not feasible. OncoSim can evaluate complex intervention scenarios for multiple cancers. Canadian decision-makers thus have a powerful tool to assess the costs, benefits, cost-effectiveness, and budgetary effects of cancer control interventions when faced with difficult choices for improvements in population health and resource allocation.";"[Gauvreau, C.

Currently, once a liver metastasis is detected, the process of finding the primary site is challenging, time-consuming, and requires multiple examinations. The proposed system can support the human expert in localizing the search for the cancer source by prioritizing the examinations to probable cancer sites. Materials and Methods: The suggested method is a learning-based approach, using computed tomography (CT) data as the input source. Each metastasis is circumscribed by a radiologist in portal phase and in non-contrast CT images. Visual features are computed from these images, combined into feature vectors, and classified using support vector machine classification. A variety of different features were explored and tested. A leave-one-out cross-validation technique was conducted for classification evaluation. The methods were developed on a set of 50 lesion cases taken from 29 patients. Results: Experiments were conducted on a separate set of 142 lesion cases taken from 71 patients with four different primary sites. Multiclass categorization results (four classes) achieved low accuracy results. However, the proposed system was found to provide promising results of 83% and 99% for top-2 and top-3 classification tasks, respectively. Moreover, when compared to the experts' ability to distinguish the different metastases, the system shows improved results. Conclusions: Automated systems, such as the one proposed, show promising new results and demonstrate new capabilities that, in the future, will be able to provide decision and treatment support for radiologists and oncologists, toward more efficient detection and treatment of cancer.

The risk of recurrence is elevated in patients with high-risk cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities, as well as when allo-HCT is performed in patients with refractory disease or with persistent molecular or radiological (PET-CT scan) residual disease. Within the frame of the 7th annual workshops of the francophone society for bone marrow transplantation and cellular therapy, the working group reviewed the literature in order to elaborate unified guidelines for the prevention and treatment of relapse after allo-HCT. For high risk AML and MDS, a post transplant maintenance strategy is possible, using hypomethylating agents or TKI anti-FLT3 when the target is present. For Philadelphia positive ALL, there was a consensus for the use of post-transplant TKI maintenance. For lymphomas, there are no strong data on the use of post-transplant maintenance, and hence a preemptive strategy is recommended based on modulation of immunosuppression, close follow-up of donor chimerism, and donor lymphocytes infusion. For multiple myeloma, even though the indication of allo-HCT is controversial, our recommendation is post transplant maintenance using bortezomib, due to its a good toxicity profile without increasing the risk of GVHD.;"[Yafour, Nabil] Etab Hosp & Univ 1er Novembre 1954, Serv Hematol & Therapie Cellulaire, BP 4166, Ibn Rochd 31000, Oran, Algeria; [Yafour, Nabil] Univ Oran 1 Ahmed Ben Bella, Fac Med, Oran, Algeria; [Beckerich, Florence; Pautas, CCile] Hop Henri Mondor, Serv Hematol & Therapie Cellulaire, Blvd Marechal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-94000 Creteil, France; [Bulabois, Claude Eric] CHU Grenoble, Serv Hematol Clin, F-38043 Grenoble 9, France; [Chevallier, Patrice; Guillaume, Thierry] CHU Nantes, Serv Hematol Clin, Hotel Dieu, Pl Alexis Ricordeau, F-44035 Nantes, France; [Daguindau, Etienne] CHRU Besancon, Serv Hematol, 3 Blvd Fleming, F-25000 Besancon, France; [Dumesnil, Cecile] CHU Rouen, Serv Hematooncol Pediat, 1 Rue Germont, F-76031 Rouen, France; [Huynh, Anne] IUCT Oncopole, Serv Hematol & Greffe Cellules Souches Hematopoie, 1 Rue Irene Joliot Curie, F-31059 Toulouse, France; [Levrat, Stavroula Masouridi] Geneva Univ Hosp, Div Hematol, Dept Med Specialties, 4 Rue Gabrielle Perret Gentil, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Menard, Anne-Lise] Ctr Henri Becquerel, Serv Hematol Clin, Rue Amiens,CS 11516, F-76038 Rouen 1, France; [Michallet, Mauricette] Ctr Hosp Lyon Sud, Serv Hematol Clin, 165 Chemin Grand Revoyet, F-69495 Pierre Benite, France; [Poire, Xavier] Univ St Luc, Sect Hematol Clin, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; [Ravinet, Aurelie] CHU Clermont Ferrand, Serv Therapie Cellulaire & Hematol Clin Adulte, F-63100 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Ravinet, Aurelie] Univ Clermont Auvergne, EA7453, F-63003 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Ravinet, Aurelie] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CIC 501, F-63003 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim] Univ Lille 2, CHRU Lille, Dept Malad Sang, LIRIC Inserm U995, F-59000 Lille, France; [Bazarbachi, Ali] Amer Univ Beirut, Med Ctr, POB 113-6044, Beirut, Lebanon";Yakoub-Agha, I (corresponding author), Univ Lille 2, CHRU Lille, Dept Malad Sang, LIRIC Inserm U995, F-59000 Lille, France.;ibrahim.yakoubagha@chru-lille.fr;"Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim/R-7872-2018; Poire, Xavier/M-1748-2019";"Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim/0000-0003-4524-8782; Bulabois, Claude Eric/0000-0002-0214-7431; Bazarbachi, Ali/0000-0002-7171-4997";;;;101;2;2;0;4;JOHN LIBBEY EUROTEXT LTD;MONTROUGE;127 AVE DE LA REPUBLIQUE, 92120 MONTROUGE, FRANCE;0007-4551;1769-6917;;B CANCER;Bull.

To further enhance the efficacy of this multidisciplinary maternity network, the identification of priorities for improvement is warranted. The aim of this study was to create key recommendations for the improvement agenda, in co-production with patients and professionals. Study design: We conducted a Delphi study to inventory (round 1), prioritize (round 2) and eventually approve (round 3) the improvement agenda for the maternity network. Both patients and professionals joined this study. Initial input for the study consisted of experiences from 397 patients, collected using the ReproQ questionnaire. In round 1, the expert panel, gave improvement recommendations, based on the ReproQ results. This resulted in 11 recommendations. In the second round, the expert panel prioritised these recommendations. In the consensus meeting then finally the concrete improvement agenda was composed. Results: Priority scores differed considerably between patients and professionals in seven items, while four items received similar priority scores from both groups. The four most important improvement activities were: Realise more single bedrooms in hospitals; Create more opportunities for the continued presence of the community midwife during labour; Initiate a digital patient record view system for the network with a view function for patients; and Introduce a case manager for pregnant woman. Conclusion: Based on patient experience and the active involvement of patients and professionals, we were able to compose the shared agenda for quality improvement in maternity care.

However, foliar diseases are the key factor that can undermine the soy production, usually caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes. This letter proposes a computer vision system to track soybean foliar diseases in the field using images captured by the low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle model DJI Phantom 3. The proposed system is based on the segmentation method Simple Linear Iterative Clustering to detect plant leaves in the images and on visual attributes to describe the features of foliar physical properties, such as color, gradient, texture, and shape. Our methodology evaluated the performance of six classifiers for different heights, including 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 m. Experimental results showed that color and texture attributes lead to higher classification rates, achieving the precision of 98.34% for heights between 1 and 2 m, with a decay of 2% at each meter. Results indicate that our approach can support experts and farmers to monitor diseases in soybean fields.;"[Tetila, Everton Castelao; Guimaraes, David Augusto; Pistori, Hemerson] Univ Catolica Dom Bosco, Dept Comp Engn, BR-79906032 Campo Grande, Brazil; [Machado, Bruno Brandoli] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, BR-79907414 Campo Grande, Brazil; [de Souza Belete, Nicolas Alessandro] Fed Univ Rondonia, Dept Prod Engn, BR-76962384 Cacoal, Brazil";Machado, BB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, BR-79907414 Campo Grande, Brazil.;"brunobrandoli@gmail.com; nicolas.belete@unir.br; pistori@ucdb.br";"de Souza Belete, Nicolas Alessandro/Q-4077-2019; Pistori, Hemerson/G-3933-2012";"de Souza Belete, Nicolas Alessandro/0000-0001-8642-9665; Pistori, Hemerson/0000-0001-8181-760X; Castelao Tetila, Everton/0000-0001-5396-766X";"National Center for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (Capes)CAPES; Foundation for the development of teaching, science and technology of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (FUNDECT)";This work was supported in part by the National Center for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ), in part by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (Capes), and in part by the Foundation for the development of teaching, science and technology of the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (FUNDECT).;;26;26;26;1;42;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;1545-598X;1558-0571;;IEEE GEOSCI REMOTE S;IEEE Geosci.

Although these algorithms achieve high accuracy, mere detection of an IED holds little clinical significance. In this paper, we consider deep learning for epileptic subjects to accommodate automatic feature generation from intracranial EEG data, while also providing clinical insight. Convolutional neural networks are trained in a subject independent fashion to demonstrate how meaningful features are automatically learned in a hierarchical process. We illustrate how the convolved filters in the deepest layers provide insight toward the different types of IEDs within the group, as confirmed by our expert clinicians. The morphology of the IEDs found in filters can help evaluate the treatment of a patient. To improve the learning of the deep model, moderately different score classes are utilized as opposed to binary IED and non-IED labels. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art classification performance and is also invariant to time differences between the IEDs. This paper suggests that deep learning is suitable for automatic feature generation from intracranial EEG data, while also providing insight into the data.;"[Antoniades, Andreas; Sanei, Saeid; Took, Clive Cheong] Univ Surrey, Dept Comp Sci, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Spyrou, Loukianos] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Edinburgh EH9 3FB, Midlothian, Scotland; [Martin-Lopez, David] Kingston Hosp NHS FT, London KT2 7QB, England; [Martin-Lopez, David] Kings Coll London, London SE5 9RS, England; [Valentin, Antonio] Kings Coll Hosp London, London SE5 9RS, England; [Valentin, Antonio; Alarcon, Gonzalo] Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Alarcon, Gonzalo] Hamad Med Corp, Doha, Qatar";Antoniades, A (corresponding author), Univ Surrey, Dept Comp Sci, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.;"a.antoniades@surrey.ac.uk; l.spyrou@ed.ac.uk; david.martin_lopez@kcl.ac.uk; antonio.valentin@kcl.ac.uk; galarcon@aol.com; s.sanei@surrey.ac.uk; c.cheongtook@surrey.ac.uk";Alarcon, Gonzalo/C-4084-2013;Spyrou, Loukianos/0000-0002-6150-5067;;;;53;22;22;1;41;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;1534-4320;1558-0210;;IEEE T NEUR SYS REH;IEEE Trans.

Background: The World Health Organization definition of palliative care includes impeccable assessment and management of pain and other symptoms. However, existing nursing documentation focuses mainly on the management of physical symptoms, with other aspects of nursing less frequently documented. Methods: Supported by a project team and expert panel, cycles of review, action and reflection were used to develop a new palliative nursing documentation. The project was divided into three phases: audits of existing nursing documentation, development of a new palliative nursing care document and audit tool, and pilot implementation and audit of the new nursing documentation. Results: The new palliative nursing care document demonstrated a higher level of compliance in relation to nursing assessments and a more concise, accurate and comprehensive approach to documenting holistic nursing care and recording of patients' perspective. Conclusions: This project has enabled the consistent documentation of holistic nursing care and patients' perspectives; however, continuous education is necessary in order to sustain positive results and ensure that documentation does not become a 'tick box' exercise.

Methods and results: We prospectively enrolled 80 consecutive patients (45 males, median age 60.26 years) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF who were scheduled for PVAI. Prior to PVAI, highdensity bipolar voltage mapping (median number of 2,485 points) was carried out during sinus rhythm in all patients. Criteria for an adequate left atrium (LA) shell were > 2,000 points. Each acquired point was classified according to the peak-to-peak bipolar voltage electrogram based on two criteria (criterion A: healthy > 0.8 mV, border zone: 0.4-0.8 mV and scarred: < 0.4 mV, criterion B: healthy: > 0.5 mV, border zone: 0.25-0.5 mV and scarred: < 0.25 mV). The extent of lowvoltage area < 0.4 mV significantly predicted atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence after the blanking period (P = 0.002). In univariate analysis, the presence of LA voltage areas < 0.4 mV more than 10% of the total surface area was the only significant predictor of arrhythmia recurrence. The analysis based on window B cutoff values failed to demonstrate any predictors of arrhythmia recurrence. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that the existence of LA voltage areas < 0.4 mV more than 10% of the totalLAsurface area predicts arrhythmia recurrence followingPVAI for paroxysmalAF.;"[Vlachos, Konstantinos; Efremidis, Michael; Letsas, Konstantinos P.; Bazoukis, George; Kalafateli, Maria; Lioni, Louiza; Georgopoulos, Stamatis; Saplaouras, Athanasios; Efremidis, Theodore; Valkanas, Kosmas; Karamichalakis, Nikolaos; Asvestas, Dimitrios; Sideris, Antonios] Evangelismos Gen Hosp Athens, Dept Cardiol 2, Lab Cardiac Electrophysiol, Ipsilantou 47, Athens, Greece; [Martin, Ruairidh] Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Liu, Tong] Tianjin Med Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Ion Mol Funct Cardiovasc Dis, Dept Cardiol, Tianjin Inst Cardiol,Hosp 2, Tianjin, Peoples R China";Bazoukis, G (corresponding author), Evangelismos Gen Hosp Athens, Dept Cardiol 2, Lab Cardiac Electrophysiol, Ipsilantou 47, Athens, Greece.;gbazoykis@med.uoa.gr;Bazoukis, George/AAM-4006-2020;Bazoukis, George/0000-0003-1009-9772;British Heart FoundationBritish Heart Foundation [FS/16/71/32487];Dr Martin is supported by research fellowship FS/16/71/32487 from the British Heart Foundation.

Given the increasing incidence of diabetes, many experts hold the view that DN will eventually progress toward pandemic proportions. Whilst hyperglycaemia-induced vascular dysfunction is the primary initiating mechanism in DN, its progression is also driven by a heterogeneous set of pathological mechanisms, including oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis. Current treatment strategies for DN are targeted against the fundamental dysregulation of glycaemia and hypertension. Unfortunately, these standards of care can delay but do not prevent disease progression or the significant emotional, physical and financial costs associated with this disease. As such, there is a pressing need to develop novel therapeutics that are both effective and safe. Set against the genomic era, numerous potential target pathways in DN have been identified. However, the clinical translation of basic DN research has been met with a number of challenges. Moreover, the notion of DN as a purely vascular disease is outdated and it has become clear that DN is a multi-dimensional, multi-cellular condition. The review will highlight the current therapeutic approaches for DN and provide an insight into how the inherent complexity of DN is shaping the research pathways toward the development and clinical translation of novel therapeutic strategies.;"[Magee, Corey; Grieve, David J.; Watson, Chris J.; Brazil, Derek P.] Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Med Expt, Wellcome Wolfson Bldg,97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7AE, Antrim, North Ireland";Grieve, DJ (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Ctr Med Expt, Wellcome Wolfson Bldg,97 Lisburn Rd, Belfast BT9 7AE, Antrim, North Ireland.;d.grieve@qub.ac.uk;;Brazil, Derek/0000-0003-1375-1076;"British Heart FoundationBritish Heart Foundation; Health Research Board of Ireland; Diabetes UKDiabetes UK; Wellcome TrustWellcome Trust; British Heart FoundationBritish Heart Foundation [PG/15/18/31333, FS/12/47/29703] Funding Source: researchfish";The authors' work is supported by the British Heart Foundation, the Health Research Board of Ireland, Diabetes UK and The Wellcome Trust.;;144;52;60;1;10;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0920-3206;1573-7241;;CARDIOVASC DRUG THER;Cardiovasc.

Therefore, we introduce linear and nonlinear variables, namely Cepstrum Coefficients (CC), Filterbanks (Fbank) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis were used for classification purposes. The experiments were carried out using two databases. We achieved a per-segment accuracy of 84.76% (sensitivity = 81.45%, specificity = 86.82%, AUC = 0.92) in the Apnea-ECG Physionet database, whereas in the HuGCDN2014 database, provided by the Dr. Negrin University Hospital (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain), the best results were: accuracy = 81.96%, sensitivity = 70.95%, specificity = 85.47%, AUC = 0.87. The former results were comparable or better than those obtained by other methods for the same database in the recent literature. We have concluded that the selected features that best characterize the underlying process are common to both databases. This supports the fact that the conclusions reached are potentially generalizable. The best results were obtained when the three kinds of features were jointly used. Another notable fact is the small number of features needed to describe the phenomenon. Results suggest that the two first Fbanks, the first CC and the first DFA coefficient are the variables that best describe the RR pattern in OSA and, therefore, are especially relevant to extract discriminative information for apnea screening purposes.;"[Martin-Gonzalez, Sofia; Navarro-Mesa, Juan L.; Ravelo-Garcia, Antonio G.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Technol Dev & Innovat Commun, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Julia-Serda, Gabriel] Hosp Univ Gran Canaria Dr Negrin, Pulm Med Dept, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35010, Spain; [Kraemer, Jan F.; Wessel, Niels] Humboldt Univ, Dept Phys, D-10115 Berlin, Germany";Martin-Gonzalez, S (corresponding author), Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Technol Dev & Innovat Commun, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.;sofia.martin@ulpgc.es;"Navarro-Mesa, Juan L./L-3633-2017; Ravelo-Garcia, Antonio G./P-3709-2019";"Navarro-Mesa, Juan L./0000-0003-3860-3424; Ravelo-Garcia, Antonio G./0000-0002-8512-965X; Wessel, Niels/0000-0003-0922-9971; Martin-Gonzalez, Sofia/0000-0002-5001-9223";Catedra Telefonica, Universidad de Las Palmas deGran Canaria;We would like to thank the staff of the Dr. Negrin University Hospital Sleep Unit for their support in the acquisition of the data, as well as to Ubay Casanova for his collaboration in the first field experiments.

The convergence of modern communication systems and the healthcare industry necessitates the provision of better quality of service and experience by the service provider. Recent inclusion and standardization of the high efficiency video coder (HEVC) has made it possible for medical data to be compressed and transmitted over wireless networks with minimal compromise of the quality. Quality evaluation and assessment of these medical videos transmitted over wireless networks is another important research area that requires further exploration and attention. In this paper, we have conducted an in-depth study of video quality assessment for compressed wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) videos. Our study includes the performance evaluation of several state-of-the-art objective video quality metrics in terms of determining the quality of compressed WCE videos. Subjective video quality experiments were conducted with the assistance of experts and non-experts in order to predict the diagnostic and visual quality of these medical videos, respectively. The evaluation of the metrics is based on three major performance metrics that include, correlation between the subjective and objective scores, relative statistical performance and computation time. Results show that the metrics information fidelity criterion (IFC), visual information fidelity-(VIF) and especially pixel based VIF stand out as best performing metrics. Furthermore, our paper reports the performance of HEVC compression on medical videos and according to the results, it performs optimally in preserving the diagnostic and visual quality of WCE videos at Quantization Parameter (QP) values of up to 35 and 37 respectively.;"[Usman, Muhammad Arslan; Usman, Muhammad Rehan; Shin, Soo Young] Kumoh Natl Inst Technol, Dept IT Convergence Engn, Gumi 39177, Gyeongbuk, South Korea";Shin, SY (corresponding author), Kumoh Natl Inst Technol, Dept IT Convergence Engn, Gumi 39177, Gyeongbuk, South Korea.;"arslanusman@msn.com; rehanusman@gmail.com; wdragon@kumoh.ac.kr";Usman, Muhammad/AAF-3895-2019;"Usman, Muhammad Arslan/0000-0002-6440-4595; Shin, Soo Young/0000-0002-2526-2395; Usman, Muhammad Rehan/0000-0002-9586-0833";MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program [IITP-2017-2014-0-00639];This research was supported by the MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program (IITP-2017-2014-0-00639) supervised by the IITP (Institute for Information & communicationsTechnology Promotion).;;35;13;13;0;6;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0010-4825;1879-0534;;COMPUT BIOL MED;Comput.

The aim of this study was to develop and quantify organic farming indicators to determine the relative importance of each. The desired indicators were collected during a literature review of scientific resources about the principles of organic farming. These indices were classified into four categories and their weights were determined through interviews with experts on organic agriculture, including university professors, agroecology students, Ministry of Agriculture experts, organic fanning inspectors and organic farmers. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used for this purpose. The results showed that pest and disease management, yield, soil nutrient management, water consumption rate, chemical fertilizer consumption rate and the use of transgenic materials having weights of 0.16, 0.098, 0.096, 0.08, 0.071 and 0.059, respectively, and are the most important indicators for development and assessment of organic farming. In this as well as similar studies, the weight of indicators associated with consumption of chemical fertilizers and pesticides were relatively high. This indicates the importance of rules related to the use of chemicals in organic farming; however, each index has a certain weight and none can be overlooked. All indicators should be considered as an inseparable set and all should be used in the development of organic farming. The results of this study can be useful for both inspection bodies and organic farmers. Farmers can reduce the risks associated with transitioning to organic farming and minimize the probability of failure by monitoring these indicators in their fields.";"[Sajadian, Masoud; Khoshbakht, Korous; Liaghati, Houman; Veisi, Hadi; Damghani, Abdolmajid Mandavi] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Agroecol Dept, Environm Sci Res Inst, Tehran, Iran";Khoshbakht, K (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ, Environm Sci Res Inst, Daneshjoo Blvd,Velenjak St, Tehran, Iran.;"m_sajadian@sbu.ac.ir; kkhoshbakht@yahoo.com; h-liaghati@sbu.ac.ir; H_Veisi@sbu.ac.ir; Mahdavi.A@sbu.ac.ir";"Liaghati, Homan/AAB-1248-2021; Veisi, Hadi/U-6057-2019";sajadian, masoud/0000-0003-4636-1592;;;;110;6;8;4;35;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;1470-160X;1872-7034;;ECOL INDIC;Ecol.

The objectives of this study were to; 1) create baseline farm-level sustainability indices for smallholder shrimp farms in Sri Lanka using both content-based and system-based frameworks adapted from agriculture; 2) determine whether arranging indicators within both content- and system-based sustainability frameworks would provide additional insight into relative farm sustainability (rather than using just one framework); and 3) seek differences between the North Western Province (NWP) and the Eastern Province (EP) in sustainability index, subindex, or indicator scores that might be used to create province-specific policies and education programs designed to potentially improve sustainable practices at the farm level. Since little has been published on the development of practical indicators and evaluation of farm-level sustainability in aquaculture, this study adapted two types of frameworks used for measuring sustainability in agriculture: content- and system-based. Using both frameworks, along with expert opinion, indicators of farm level sustainability were developed into a questionnaire and measured on 225 farms in two provinces of Sri Lanka. Indicators primarily included modifiable practices that farmers could influence to improve the chances of their farms' survival. The farm indicators were normalized using min-max normalization, where scores of zero and one were assigned for the least and most sustainable options, respectively. Farm indicators in each province were then aggregated into sub-indices as well an overall aggregated sustainability index score. Similar themes were gleaned from both the content-based and system-based sustainability frameworks, and there was no significant difference between mean overall sustainability scores for the two different frameworks. Farms in the NWP scored significantly higher on the overall sustainability indices of both models despite the NWP's history of severe disease outbreaks while the EP farms had no disease. Possible reasons for this difference were explored with an in-depth analysis of sub-indices as well as individual indicators. An overall aggregated sustainability index score was a useful baseline measure for monitoring changes in sustainability over time; however, its use was limited when attempting to identify gaps in sustainable management practices and provide practical information for farmers and stakeholders to improve farm-level sustainability. It was important to evaluate individual indicators in addition to sub-indices and overall index scores when making recommendations or identifying gaps in sustainable practices at the farm level.";"[Westers, Trisha; Ribble, Carl; Checkley, Sylvia; Wu, Jessica P.] Univ Calgary, Fac Vet Med, 3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada; [Ribble, Carl] Ctr Coastal Hlth, 900 Fifth St, Nanaimo, BC V9R 5S5, Canada; [Stephen, Craig] Univ Saskatchewan, Western Coll Vet Med, Canadian Wildlife Hlth Cooperat, 52 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B4, Canada; [Daniel, Sam] Natl Livestock Dev Board, Narahenpitiya 5, Colombo, Sri Lanka";Westers, T (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Fac Vet Med, 3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada.;"tjw810@mail.usask.ca; cribble@ucalgary.ca; samdaniel.tc@gmail.com; slcheckl@ucalgary.ca";;Checkley, Sylvia/0000-0002-9118-2721;"International Development Research Centre (IDRC) in Ottawa, Canada; Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA); University of Calgary; Province of Alberta";We gratefully acknowledge the shrimp farmers who participated in the study.

For instance, dissenting opinions exist as to whether formal methods (including static analysis, theorem proving, and model checking) are appropriate in CPS verification and validation. Simulation tools and simulation-based testing are also often considered insufficient for CPS. Many experts posit that high-level programming languages (e.g., Java or C#) are not applicable to CPS due to their inability to address (significant) resource constraints at a high level of abstraction. To date, empirical studies investigating these questions have not been done. In this paper, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze why debugging CPS remains challenging and either dispel or confirm these strongly held beliefs along the way. Specifically, we report on a structured online survey of 25 CPS researchers (10 participants classified themselves as CPS developers), semistructured interviews with nine practitioners across four continents, and a qualitative literature review.

Applications of existing HRA methods are often domain-specific, and difficult to implement even for experts. Also, due to the lack of empirical data, managing uncertainty is important, if not essential. In view of such limitations, we propose a new and comprehensive HRA methodology acronymed PRELUDE (Performance shaping factor-based human REliability assessment using vaLUation-baseD systEms). It is a quantitative and qualitative HRA methodology, applied to railway operations. The qualitative part characterizes a safety critical situation using performance shaping factors (PSFs). The PSFs are identified from domain specific human factors and PSF-based studies. The quantitative proposition is a framework of a graphicalmodel (Valuation-based System) and belief functions theory. Appropriate representation and handling of all types of uncertainties, and combination of conflicting expert opinions is considered in this framework. To aid in the choice of appropriate combination method, combined expert data are discussed and compared using quantitative metrics. PRELUDE allows quantifying a human failure event given an operational context. Sensitivity analysis is used to establish a priority ranking among the PSFs.

Much of this information has to be processed as it arrives because a real-time response is often needed. Stream processing architectures solve this kind of problems, but sometimes it is not easy to benchmark the load capacity or the efficiency of a proposed architecture. This work presents a real case project in which an infrastructure was needed for gathering information from drivers in a big city, analyzing that information and sending real-time recommendations to improve driving efficiency and safety on roads. The challenge was to support the real-time recommendation service in a city with thousands of simultaneous drivers at the lowest possible cost. In addition, in order to estimate the ability of an infrastructure to handle load, a simulator that emulates the data produced by a given amount of simultaneous drivers was also developed. Experiments with the simulator show how recent stream processing platforms like Apache Kafka could replace custom-made streaming servers in a smart city to achieve a higher scalability and faster responses, together with cost reduction.

These models can be created either from scratch or by reusing exiting reference process models. Particular types of reference models are configurable process models that are created by merging multiple models into a single one that can be customized to the needs of the business experts. Using those models presents two main challenges: their creation and their configuration. In this paper, we focus on the first challenge and propose a novel algorithm for merging process models into a configurable process model. The difference in our work is the pre-annotated process models with their business capabilities that report on what actions each process element achieves. Our algorithm generates configurable models that are also annotated with their capabilities that can be used to face the second challenge of these models: the configuration phase. We tested our algorithm using real-world process models to evaluate the required creation time and resulting compression rate after merging the input models. The results show that the models can be created in few milliseconds and achieving a compression rate of 50%. We further carried out interviews with domain experts to assess the usefulness and the level of maturity of this work. The results show the importance of the automation of process merging using a tool support that we proposed. However, further adaptation efforts are required to integrate this work in the working environments of the interviewed experts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI) provides national decision makers and global stakeholders with opportunities to benchmark and accelerate performance improvement through better performance measurement. Results from the initial PHC performance assessments in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are helping guide PHC reforms and investments and improve the PHCPI's instruments and indicators. Findings from future assessment activities will further amplify cross-country comparisons and peer learning to improve PHC. New indicators and sources of data are needed to better understand PHC system performance in LMICs. ContextThe Primary Health Care Performance Initiative (PHCPI), a collaboration between the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The World Bank, and the World HealthOrganization, in partnership with Ariadne Labs and Results for Development, was launched in 2015 with the aim of catalyzing improvements in primary health care (PHC) systems in 135 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), in order to accelerate progress toward universal health coverage. Through more comprehensive and actionable measurement of quality PHC, the PHCPI stimulates peer learning among LMICs and informs decision makers to guide PHC investments and reforms. Instruments for performance assessment and improvement are in development; to date, a conceptual framework and 2 sets of performance indicators have been released. MethodsThe PHCPI team developed the conceptual framework through literature reviews and consultations with an advisory committee of international experts. We generated 2 sets of performance indicators selected from a literature review of relevant indicators, cross-referenced against indicators available from international sources, and evaluated through 2 separate modified Delphi processes, consisting of online surveys and in-person facilitated discussions with experts. FindingsThe PHCPI conceptual framework builds on the current understanding of PHC system performance through an expanded emphasis on the role of service delivery. The first set of performance indicators, 36 Vital Signs, facilitates comparisons across countries and over time. The second set, 56 Diagnostic Indicators, elucidates underlying drivers of performance. Key challenges include a lack of available data for several indicators and a lack of validated indicators for important dimensions of quality PHC. ConclusionsThe availability of data is critical to assessing PHC performance, particularly patient experience and quality of care. The PHCPI will continue to develop and test additional performance assessment instruments, including composite indices and national performance dashboards. Through country engagement, the PHCPI will further refine its instruments and engage with governments to better design and finance primary health care reforms.";"[Veillard, Jeremy; Cowling, Krycia; Mercereau, Laure] World Bank Grp, 1776 G St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Veillard, Jeremy] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Cowling, Krycia] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Bitton, Asaf; Ratcliffe, Hannah] Brigham & Womens Hosp, Ariadne Labs, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Bitton, Asaf; Ratcliffe, Hannah; Kimball, Meredith] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Kimball, Meredith; Taylor, Chelsea] Results Dev, Washington, DC USA; [Barkley, Shannon] World Hlth Org, Geneva, Switzerland; [Wong, Ethan; Wang, Hong] Bill & Melinda Gates Fdn, Seattle, WA USA; [Hirschhorn, Lisa R.] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Evanston, IL 60208 USA";Veillard, J (corresponding author), World Bank Grp, 1776 G St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;jveillard@worldbank.org;;Cowling, Krycia/0000-0003-2489-5390;Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation;Funding for the Primary Health Care Performance Initiative is provided by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.;;33;34;34;0;16;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0887-378X;1468-0009;;MILBANK Q;Milbank Q.;DEC;2017;95;4;;;;;836;883;;10.1111/1468-0009.12301;;;48;"Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services";Health Care Sciences & Services;FP5AR;WOS:000417629900014;29226448;Green Published, Other Gold;;;2021-02-18;
J;Paradis, C;;;;Paradis, Cheryl;;;Assessment of Intimate Partner Violence and the Battered Woman Syndrome;PSYCHIATRIC ANNALS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;WOMEN;Forensic experts are often retained to conduct an evaluation of the mental state at the time of the offense of women charged with assaulting or killing spouses or partners. Many of these women report histories of intimate partner violence and a cluster of psychiatric/psychological symptoms that researchers have termed the battered woman syndrome (BWS). The clinical picture is similar to posttraumatic stress disorder. Expert testimony on BWS has become more accepted in the legal system during the past 30 years. Testimony can be mitigating and, at times, sufficient for the trier of fact to conclude that the defendant acted in self-defense. This article reviews research on BWS and describes the forensic expert's role in these cases. In addition to assessing mental state at the time of the offense, the expert often dispels myths associated with BWS and describes how each defendant did or did not fit the stereotype of the battered woman.;"[Paradis, Cheryl] Suny Downstate Med Ctr, Brooklyn, NY 11203 USA; [Paradis, Cheryl] Marymt Manhattan Coll, New York, NY USA";Paradis, C (corresponding author), Pratt Stn, POB 050-145, Brooklyn, NY 11205 USA.;cherylparadis1@gmail.com;;;;;;32;0;0;4;23;SLACK INC;THOROFARE;6900 GROVE RD, THOROFARE, NJ 08086 USA;0048-5713;1938-2456;;PSYCHIAT ANN;Psychiatr.

This is due to the ever-increasing demand for emergency medical care across the country. To better inform the next phase of this development, we undertook an assessment of the current state of EMS training in Kenya. Methods: A group of international and Kenyan experts with relevant EMS and educational expertise conducted an observational qualitative assessment of Kenyan EMS training institutions in 2016. Three assessment techniques were utilised: semi-structured interviews, document review, and structured observations. Recommendations were reached through a consensus process amongst the assessment team. Results: Key findings include: (i) No national or state-level policy exists that establishes levels of EMS providers or expected fund of knowledge and skills; (ii) Training institutions have independently created their own individual training standards; (iii) Training materials are not adapted for the local context; (iv) The foundation of basic anatomy and physiology education is weak; (v) Training does not focus on symptom-or syndrome-based complaints; (vi) Students had difficulty applying foundational classroom knowledge in simulations and clinical encounters; (vii) There is limited emphasis on complex critical thinking. Discussion: Standardisation of training is needed in Kenya, including clearly defined levels of providers and expected learning outcomes. A nationally standardised EMS provider scope of practice may also help focus EMS education. Instructors must reinforce basic anatomy and physiology amongst all trainees to establish a robust foundation, then layer on field experience before trainees receive advanced training. Training graduates should be EMS providers who approach patient care with high-order symptom-or syndrome-based critical thinking. While these recommendations are specific to the Kenyan EMS environment, they may have wider applicability to other developing EMS systems in resource-limited settings.

Data were obtained from an expert opinion survey of avalanche professionals, a dataset of avalanched starting zones that were field-investigated, and a dataset of avalanches from the Canadian information sharing system. The survey and the tool consisted of three sections: snowpack conditions, weather conditions, and avalanche observations. Parameters in the tool were assigned importance values derived from the survey responses. A classification tree was used to determine the threshold tool sum for increasing the likelihood of observing natural persistent deep slab avalanches. Based on some of the data used to create the tool, the tool correctly explained 75% of days with natural avalanches (16 out of 18) and non-avalanche days (61 out of 85), but the false alarm ratio was high (60%). The tool also indicates if triggered avalanches from localized dynamic loads are possible, depending on responses in the snowpack conditions section of the tool. Avalanche forecasters must apply the tool to certain terrain characteristics, at a local to regional scale. The tool may benefit from location-based calibration. The tool only indicates the likelihood of persistent deep slab avalanches based on the datasets used and it cannot determine when or where they will occur.;"[Conlan, Michael; Jamieson, Bruce] Univ Calgary, Dept Civil Engn, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada";Conlan, M (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Civil Engn, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.;"mike.conlan@ucalgary.ca; bruce.jamieson@ucalgary.ca";;"Conlan, Michael/0000-0002-9282-6154; Jamieson, Bruce/0000-0001-7608-7163";"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; Parks Canada; HeliCat Canada; Canadian Avalanche Association; Mike Wiegele Helicopter Skiing; Canada West Ski Areas Association; Backcountry Lodges of British Columbia Association; Association of Canadian Mountain Guides; Teck Mining Company; Avalanche Canada; Canadian Ski Guide Association, Backcountry Access; B.C.

Thus, selecting convenient locations for solar farms has become a fundamental problem when determining the investment required due to differences in climatic factors, the type and availability of land, transportation infrastructures, and the quality of power lines. Multi-Criteria Evaluation approaches based on crisp data are generally used in the selection process of optimal locations. However, despite being crisp, the data available when considering the evaluation criteria of the different alternatives constitute a discrete approximation performed on a spatial grid of potential locations. Thus, we introduce a three-stage fuzzy evaluation framework designed to account for the imprecision inherent to the evaluations when identifying the most convenient location for constructing solar power farms. First, we implement ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) on the set of grid intersection crisp data points and derive a coherent set of approximations per each potential discrete location and evaluation criterion. Then, the fuzzy AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method is used to determine the weights of the different criteria considered from the linguistic evaluations provided by different experts. Finally, we define a set of if-then rules combining the different ANFIS evaluation criteria and their weights within a FIS (Fuzzy Inference System) whose output is used to determine the most convenient location for constructing a solar power farm. The efficacy of the proposed evaluation framework is demonstrated through its application to the Iranian regions of Kerman and Yazd. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The CO2 heat pump water heater (HPWH) is one such innovation led by Japan, the technology leader of the Pacific Rim. The product was developed over the last decade, and many countries have configured the technology to local needs due to the benign nature and high efficiency potential of the technology. However, CO2 HPWH has yet to enter the Pacific Northwest market. Hence, a detailed roadmap needs to be outlined for the replacement of the existing less efficient water heaters and the integration of the CO2 HPWH technology in the region. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), has been relentlessly working towards energy efficiency as one of its many community outreach programs. The CO2 Heat Pump Water Heater is one of a kind project initiated by the BPA in collaboration with the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance (NEEA). With guidance from experts at BPA, NEEA, the Energy Trust of Oregon, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and other stakeholders, an action plan has been developed focusing on CO2 refrigerant technologies for heat pump water heater applications. The project identifies where opportunities exist in the coming years for specific actions to be taken in the areas of emerging technologies research, utility program development, market research, and related activities to help increase regional adoption of these energy-efficient systems. The roadmap has given some interesting insights. Projects are undertaken for improving the efficiency of components and equipment technology. Extensive testing and measure development initiatives are headed towards facilitating enactment of law or regulation. However, cost is one of the most important aspect in adoption of the technology and utilities and other stakeholders needs to come forward in incentivizing the project. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Expert witness research and writing in more than one hundred immigration and criminal cases is the basis for a discussion of the political and legal constraints that often lead to a particular characterization of Mexico, one which lies in contradiction to conventional anthropological approaches to the cultures anthropologists study. We consider these matters in terms of several issues about which the expert witness develops arguments and sometimes wins asylum and criminal cases: Mexican cultural practices,drug trafficking activities, and the Mexican political system. We conclude that given the great dangers faced by immigrant defendants, academic experts should make good enough arguments in order to pragmatically defend such clients in immigration and criminal courts, even if those arguments may differ from how anthropologists typically portray immigrants and Mexico in academic publications.;"[Campbell, Howard] Univ Texas El Paso, Anthropol, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Campbell, Howard] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Slack, Jeremy] Univ Texas El Paso, Geog, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Diedrich, Brian] Univ Texas El Paso, Sociol, El Paso, TX 79968 USA";"Campbell, H (corresponding author), Univ Texas El Paso, Anthropol, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.; Campbell, H (corresponding author), Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.";;;;;;;53;0;0;0;5;SOC APPLIED ANTHROPOLOGY;OKLAHOMA CITY;3000 UNITED FOUNDERS BLVD, STE 148, OKLAHOMA CITY, OK 73112 USA;0018-7259;1938-3525;;HUM ORGAN;Hum.

This research proposes a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model to prioritize agricultural water demand management (AWDM) strategies based on surveys carried out with 35 Iranian experts in an arid region. It hybridized the advantages of the modified technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (MTOPSIS) and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methods, and it is called MTAHP. The AHP model is used to determine the relative weights and consistency ratio assessment and finally the MTOPSIS model is used to rank the strategies. Moreover, ELimination and Choice Expressing REality III (ELECTRE III) as a non-compensatory model and simple additive weighting (SAW) as a compensatory model were used for comparison with the proposed model. The proposed model result was similar to the SAW model but different from ELECTRE III. High-ranked strategies are training farmers, improvement of cropping patterns and land levelling and modernization of the irrigation systems in the region, respectively. The results of this research show the ability of the hybrid model of AHP and MTOPSIS to prioritize the strategies for AWDM which is recommended for other similar regions.

One of the measures for performance improvement is application of automatic systems such as hydro-mechanical gates. The decision-making process for application of automatic systems is a complicated task. Reasons for this complexity are the wide range of existing technologies to be selected from, interactions between components and economic and social short- and long-term impacts. Development of a suitable model which addresses all aspects of automation is needed. One suitable technique for coping with this is a system dynamic approach. In this research, the dynamic behaviour of irrigation networks using automated control systems is investigated and its conceptual model is developed as a first step of a system dynamic model. A questionnaire based on system dynamic archetypes was designed and completed by irrigation experts from six irrigation networks in Iran. In addition, interview techniques were used to collect data. The conceptual model was developed by a system dynamic approach. The conceptual model includes fixes that fail, limits to growth, eroding goals, success to the successful, and shifting the burden archetypes. The interactions between social, managerial, economic, technical and water resources in the long term, which play a significant role, are well elaborated in the developed conceptual model.

Bank Operation Centers serve to reduce the operational workload of branches. Centralized management also offers personalized service by appointed expert employees in these centers. Inherently, workload volume of money transfer transactions changes dramatically in hours. Therefore, workforce should be planned instantly or early to save labor force and increase operational efficiency. This paper introduces a hybrid multi stage approach for workforce planning in bank operation centers by the application of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. Expected workload would be predicted as supervised learning whereas employees are clustered into different skill groups as unsupervised learning to match transactions and proper employees. Finally, workforce optimization is analyzed for proposed approach on production data.;"[Serengil, Sefik Ilkin] SoftTech AS, Res & Dev Ctr, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ozpinar, Alper] Istanbul Ticaret Univ, Mechatron Engn Dept, Istanbul, Turkey";Serengil, SI (corresponding author), SoftTech AS, Res & Dev Ctr, Istanbul, Turkey.;serengil@gmail.com;Ozpinar, Alper/E-9875-2015;Ozpinar, Alper/0000-0003-1250-5949;Turkish government organization TUBITAK TEYDEB (Technology and Innovation Funding Programs Directorate of The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey)Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK) [3150070];This work has been conducted by SoftTech A.S. under the project number 5059, and supported by Turkish government organization TUBITAK TEYDEB (Technology and Innovation Funding Programs Directorate of The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) in scope of Industrial Research and Development Projects Grant Program (1501) under the project number 3150070.;;12;7;8;1;9;UNIV INT RIOJA-UNIR;LOGRONO;RECTORADO, AVENIDA DE LA PAZ, 137, LOGRONO, 26006, SPAIN;1989-1660;;;INT J INTERACT MULTI;Int.

Background: Prosthesis should be donned and doffed few times during the day and night; thus, it is important to measure ease of donning and doffing. Study design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: The questionnaire was designed and evaluated by a group of experts. The final questionnaire was administered to 50 individuals with trans-tibial amputation. A test-retest study was also conducted on 20 amputees to assess the repeatability of questionnaire items. Results: The prosthesis donning and doffing questionnaire was developed and tested through a pilot study. Based on Kappa index, the questionnaire items showed correlation coefficients greater than 0.7, which indicate good reliability and repeatability. The majority of the participants had good hand dexterity (80%) and could perform all types of grasps. The mean satisfaction scores with donning and doffing were 69.9 and 81.4, respectively. Most of the respondents needed to don and doff the prosthesis 3.44 times per day. Based on a 7-point score, the total scores ranged between 3 and 7. Conclusion: The prosthesis donning and doffing questionnaire items showed good psychometric properties. A scoring method was suggested based on the pilot sample, which requires further evaluation to be able to differentiate between more suspension types. A larger international multicenter evaluation is required in the future to measure the responsiveness of the scales. This questionnaire will be useful in the evaluation of the ability of amputees to don and doff a trans-tibial limb prosthesis. Clinical relevance Donning and doffing of prostheses are challenging tasks for many lower limb amputees. The prosthesis donning and doffing questionnaire, on its own or combined with other prosthetic evaluation questionnaires, has the potential to help manufacturers, clinicians, and researchers gain knowledge and improve the donning and doffing qualities of prostheses.";"[Abu Osman, Noor Azuan; Eshraghi, Arezoo; Gholizadeh, Hossein; Abas, Wan Abu Bakar Wan] Univ Malaya, Dept Biomed Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Eshraghi, Arezoo] Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabil Hosp, 150 Kilgour Rd, Toronto, ON M4G 1R8, Canada; [Gholizadeh, Hossein] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Ctr Rehabil Res & Dev, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Lechler, Knut] Ossur Ehf, R&D Med Off, Reykjavik, Iceland";"Eshraghi, A (corresponding author), Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabil Hosp, 150 Kilgour Rd, Toronto, ON M4G 1R8, Canada.; Abu Osman, NA (corresponding author), Univ Malaya, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.";"azuan@um.edu.my; arezoo@um.edu.my";"ABU OSMAN, NOOR AZUAN/B-9265-2010; Gholizadeh, Hossein/G-4838-2010";"ABU OSMAN, NOOR AZUAN/0000-0002-2853-4421; Gholizadeh, Hossein/0000-0001-5847-7985; Lechler, Knut/0000-0002-9337-6829";"University of Malaya UM/MOHE/HIR grant [D000014-16001]; Ossur ehf";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by the University of Malaya UM/MOHE/HIR grant (grant no.

The Leap Motion controller is a new device able to track linear objects with sub-millimeter accuracy. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of a virtual reality (VR) simulator for assessment of basic laparoscopic skills, based on the low-cost Leap Motion controller. A simple interface was constructed to simulate the insertion point of the instruments into the abdominal cavity. The controller provided information about the position and orientation of the instruments. Custom tools were constructed to simulate the laparoscopic setup. Three basic VR tasks were developed: camera navigation (CN), instrument navigation (IN), and bimanual operation (BO). The experiments were carried out in two simulation centers: MPLSC (Athens, Greece) and CRESENT (Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia). Two groups of surgeons (28 experts and 21 novices) participated in the study by performing the VR tasks. Skills assessment metrics included time, pathlength, and two task-specific errors. The face validity of the training scenarios was also investigated via a questionnaire completed by the participants. Expert surgeons significantly outperformed novices in all assessment metrics for IN and BO (p < 0.05). For CN, a significant difference was found in one error metric (p < 0.05). The greatest difference between the performances of the two groups occurred for BO. Qualitative analysis of the instrument trajectory revealed that experts performed more delicate movements compared to novices. Subjects' ratings on the feedback questionnaire highlighted the training value of the system. This study provides evidence regarding the potential use of the Leap Motion controller for assessment of basic laparoscopic skills. The proposed system allowed the evaluation of dexterity of the hand movements. Future work will involve comparison studies with validated simulators and development of advanced training scenarios on current Leap Motion controller.;"[Lahanas, Vasileios; Loukas, Constantinos; Georgiou, Konstantinos] Univ Athens, Sch Med, Med Phys Lab, Simulat Ctr, Mikras Asias 75 Str, Athens 11527, Greece; [Lababidi, Hani; Al-Jaroudi, Dania] King Fahad Med City, Ctr Res Educ & Simulat Enhanced Training, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia";Loukas, C (corresponding author), Univ Athens, Sch Med, Med Phys Lab, Simulat Ctr, Mikras Asias 75 Str, Athens 11527, Greece.;cloukas@med.uoa.gr;Loukas, Constantinos/M-8890-2018;Loukas, Constantinos/0000-0001-7879-7329;King Fahad Medical City-Riyadh Saudi Arabia [015-006];Funding was provided by King Fahad Medical City-Riyadh Saudi Arabia (Intramural fund number 015-006).;;25;9;9;1;21;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0930-2794;1432-2218;;SURG ENDOSC;Surg.

Although different EST techniques for such a situation exist, comparative studies are lacking. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of different EST techniques using a novel mechanical simulator. Ten expert endoscopists performed 6 different EST techniques on a novel mechanical Billroth II (BII) simulator in a random sequence. The EST techniques were (1) standard sphincterotome used with a side-viewing endoscope, (2) BII sphincterotome used with a side-viewing endoscope, (3) needle-knife EST guided by biliary endoprosthesis used with a side-viewing endoscope, (4) standard sphincterotome used with a forward-viewing endoscope, (5) BII sphincterotome used with a forward-viewing endoscope, and (6) needle-knife EST guided by biliary endoprosthesis used with a forward-viewing endoscope. The results of videotaped ESTs were evaluated by a blinded expert and duration for each EST modality was calculated. Needle-knife EST guided by endoprosthesis was rated superior to EST using a BII sphincterotome (p = 0.017) or a standard sphincterotome (p < 0.001). EST using the BII sphincterotome was significantly faster than EST with the needle knife (p = 0.004) and the standard sphincterotome (p = 0.005). There were no differences between the use of a forward-viewing endoscope and a side-viewing endoscope. In an ex vivo model for EST in B II gastrectomy needle-knife EST guided by endoprosthesis achieved superior ratings in comparison to the use of a BII sphincterotome, although it was more time-consuming.

This is not straightforward because, to subjectivists, all probabilities are epistemic, whereas to frequentists, all probabilities are aleatory. We illustrate the inadequacy of purely subjectivist and purely frequentist interpretations of probability by examining the probabilistic meaning of the mean hazard. We advocate a unified approach based on experimental concepts that define aleatory variability in terms of exchangeable sequences of observations, and we show how experimental concepts allow testing of models based on expert opinion by frequentist methods.;"[Marzocchi, W.] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol, Ctr Pericolosita Sism, Via Vigna Murata 605, I-00143 Rome, Italy; [Jordan, T.

Despite these facts, most traditional risk assessment techniques focus on technical aspects of systems and have some limitations of incorporating efficient links between risk models and human and organizational factors. This paper presents a method for risk analysis of technological systems. Application of the presented framework makes it possible to analyze the influence of technical, human, organizational, and environmental risk factors on system safety. It encompasses system lifecycle from design to operational phase to give a comprehensive picture of system risks. The developed framework comprises the following main steps: (1) development of a conceptual risk analysis framework, (2) identifying risk influencing factors in different levels of technical, human, organizational, and environmental factors providing the possibility of analyzing interactions in a multi-level system, (3) modeling system risk using dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), (4) assignment of probabilities and risk quantification in node probability tables (NPTs) based on industry records and experts extracted knowledge, (5) implementation of the model for wind turbines risk analysis combining use of V-model, risk factors, and DBN in order to analyze the risk, and (6) analyzing different scenarios and the interactions in different levels.

Such applications have received considerable attention from experts in computer science, psychology, communications and health care. Emotion-based sentiment analysis can be performed using supervised and unsupervised techniques. The existing studies using supervised and unsupervised emotion-based sentiment analysis are based on Ekman's basic emotion model; have limited coverage of emotion-words, polarity shifters and negations; and lack emoticons and slang. The problems associated with existing approaches can be overcome by the development of an effective, sentence-level emotion-detection sentiment analysis system under a rule-based classification scheme with extended lexicon support and an enhanced model of emotion signals: emotion words, polarity shifters, negations, emoticons and slang. In this work, we propose a rule-based framework for emotion-based sentiment classification at the sentence level obtained from user reviews. The main contribution of this work is to integrate cognitive-based emotion theory (e.g. Ekman's model) with sentiment analysis-based computational techniques (e.g. detection of emotion words, emoticons and slang) to detect and classify emotions from natural language text. The main focus is to improve the performance of state-of-the-art methods by including additional emotion-related signals, such as emotion words, emoticons, slang, polarity shifters and negations, to efficiently detect and classify emotions in user reviews. The improved results in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method's classification results compared with baseline methods.

Until now, the extent of these problems in the home care setting was unclear. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted as part of a nationwide survey from the perspective of bereaved family members in Japan (J-HOPE3). The bereaved family members rated the symptoms of delirium and suicidal ideation of patients with cancer, and the sleeplessness and depressed mood of family caregivers utilizing home care services in the one month before the patients' deaths. Regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with caregivers' sleeplessness or depressed mood. Results: Of the 532 subjects analyzed, between 17% and 65% of patients experienced various symptoms of delirium, and 27% suicidal ideation. Among family caregivers, 60% experienced sleeplessness and 35% experienced depressed mood at least once during the week. Caregivers' psychological symptoms were associated with their own poor health status, being the spouse of the patient, and the patients' psychological or psychiatric symptoms. To manage patients' symptoms, 11% of caregivers had consulted psychiatrists or psychologists while another 11% wanted to do so. Conclusion: Psychological problems assessed were common among patients with cancer and their family caregivers in the one month of home care prior to the patient's death.

The need of conducting uncertainty analysis in software reliability for the large and complex system is demanding. For large complex systems made up of many components, the uncertainty of each individual parameter amplifies the uncertainty of the total system reliability. In this paper, to overcome with the problem of uncertainty in software development process and environment, a neuro-fuzzy modeling has been proposed for software fault prediction. The training of the proposed neuro-fuzzy model has been done with genetic algorithm and back-propagation learning algorithm. The proposed model has been validated using some real software failure data. The efficiency of the two learning algorithms has been compared with various fuzzy and statistical time series-based forecasting algorithms on the basis of their prediction ability.;"[Chatterjee, S.] ISM, Dept Appl Math, Dhanbad 826004, Bihar, India; [Nigam, S.] Pandit Deendayal Petr Univ, Dept Appl Math, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India; [Roy, A.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Singapore 117576, Singapore";Chatterjee, S (corresponding author), ISM, Dept Appl Math, Dhanbad 826004, Bihar, India.;"chatterjee_subhashis@rediffmail.com; royism.arunava@gmail.com";"Nigam, Shobhit/Z-2584-2019; Chatterjee, Subhashis/I-9756-2014";"Nigam, Shobhit/0000-0002-7758-7749; Chatterjee, Subhashis/0000-0001-7908-6705";University Grants Communication (UGC), New Delhi, India [33-115/2007 (SR)];Authors acknowledge University Grants Communication (UGC), New Delhi, India, for financial help under the project number F.No. 33-115/2007 (SR) and Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad, India, for providing necessary facilities for this work.

Almost all of the current attribute based access control (ABAC) models do not meet all the operational needs in access decision while it absolutely will be an important role in the future access control models. We believe that meeting the operational need in missions is necessary in ranking the attributes which are existed in the access control policies. In this paper we propose a new approach that helps to enhance ABAC. It creates the quantitative capability which we named it quantitative ABAC and is based on decision fusion. We determine the attributes which have the most important role in the enterprises access management. Then, the experts consider and prioritize the attributes to determine which of attributes are more important than others. In the other word, we provide the weights as the importance of access control attributes based on decision-makers' viewpoints by utilizing ordered weighted averaging for the proposed prioritization. As the result of this research, it is possible that if there are some corrected values with high ranking among N parameters in attributes, the permission may be granted. The case study considerations show that decision fusion can be useful in solving some challenges of risk adaptable access control models. This enables policymakers to manage and control the system resources more accurately and flexibility in integrated and complex systems. The results of this study could be useful in integrated environments such as c4i systems.;"[Rashidi, Ali Jabar] Malek Ashtar Univ Technol, Elect & Elect Engn Complex, Tehran, Iran; [Rezakhani, Afshin] Malek Ashtar Univ Technol, Informat Commun & Secur Technol Complex, Tehran, Iran";Rezakhani, A (corresponding author), Malek Ashtar Univ Technol, Informat Commun & Secur Technol Complex, Tehran, Iran.;"aiorashid@yahoo.com; Af.rezakhani@gmail.com";;;;;;36;3;3;0;4;SPRINGER LONDON LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;0941-0643;1433-3058;;NEURAL COMPUT APPL;Neural Comput.

The analysis of power disturbances in electrical systems is typically performed in two steps: disturbance detection and disturbance classification. Disturbance detection is usually made through space transform techniques, and their classification is usually performed through artificial intelligence methods. The problem with those approaches is the adequate selection of parameters for these techniques. Due to the advantages of a variant scheme known as the micro-genetic algorithms, in this investigation, a new methodology to directly detect and classify electrical disturbances in one step is developed. The proposed approach is validated through synthetic signals and experimental test on real data, and the obtained results are compared with the particle swarm optimization method in order to show the effectiveness of this methodology.;"[Yosimar Jaen-Cuellar, Arturo; Morales-Velazquez, Luis; Alfredo Osornio-Rios, Roque] Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Ingn, HSPdigital CA Mecatron, Campus San Juan del Rio,Rio Moctezuma 249, San Juan Del Rio 76807, Qro, Mexico; [de Jesus Romero-Troncoso, Rene] Univ Guanajuato, HSPdigital CA Telemat, DICIS, Carr Salamanca Valle Km 3-5 1-8, Salamanca 36700, Gto, Mexico; [Morinigo-Sotelo, Daniel] Univ Valladolid, Elect Engn Dept, EII, C Paseo Cauce 59, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain";Osornio-Rios, RA (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Ingn, HSPdigital CA Mecatron, Campus San Juan del Rio,Rio Moctezuma 249, San Juan Del Rio 76807, Qro, Mexico.;"ayjaen@hspdigital.org; lmorales@hspdigital.org; troncoso@hspdigital.org; daniel.morinigo@eii.uva.es; raosornio@hspdigital.org";"MORINIGO-SOTELO, DANIEL/A-1908-2009; Romero-Troncoso, Rene D J/D-1142-2011; Osornio-Rios, Roque A/B-1970-2015";"Romero-Troncoso, Rene D J/0000-0003-3192-5332; Osornio-Rios, Roque A/0000-0003-0868-2918";;;;44;4;4;0;11;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0941-0643;1433-3058;;NEURAL COMPUT APPL;Neural Comput.

Timely recognition of renal involvement and appropriate treatment are essential to prevent renal damage. The Single Hub and Access point for paediatric Rheumatology in Europe (SHARE) initiative aimed to generate diagnostic and management regimens for children and adolescents with rheumatic diseases including cSLE. Here, we provide evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of childhood LN. Recommendations were developed using the European League Against Rheumatism standard operating procedures. A European-wide expert committee including paediatric nephrology representation formulated recommendations using a nominal group technique. Six recommendations regarding diagnosis and 20 recommendations covering treatment choices and goals were accepted, including each class of LN, described in the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society 2003 classification system. Treatment goal should be complete renal response. Treatment of class I LN should mainly be guided by other symptoms. Class II LN should be treated initially with low-dose prednisone, only adding a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug after 3 months of persistent proteinuria or prednisone dependency. Induction treatment of class III/IV LN should be mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or intravenous cyclophosphamide combined with corticosteroids; maintenance treatment should be MMF or azathioprine for at least 3 years. In pure class V LN, MMF with low-dose prednisone can be used as induction and MMF as maintenance treatment. The SHARE recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of LN have been generated to support uniform and high-quality care for all children with SLE.";"[Groot, Noortje; de Graeff, Nienke; van Royen-Kerkhof, Annet; Vastert, Bas J.; Wulffraat, Nico M.] Wilhelmina Childrens Hosp, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Groot, Noortje; Kamphuis, Sylvia] Erasmus Univ, Med Ctr, Sophia Childrens Hosp, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Marks, Stephen D.; Brogan, Paul; Pilkington, Clarissa A.] Great Ormond St Hosp Children NHS Fdn Trust, London, England; [Avcin, Tadej] Univ Childrens Hosp Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Bader-Meunier, Brigitte] Hop Necker Enfants Malad, AP HP, Paris, France; [Dolezalova, Pavla] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Med 1, Prague, Czech Republic; [Feldman, Brian M.] Univ Toronto, Hosp Sick Children, Div Rheumatol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kone-Paut, Isabelle] Univ Paris Sud, Bicetre Hosp, APHP, Paris, France; [Lahdenne, Pekka] Univ Helsinki, Hosp Children & Adolescents, Helsinki, Finland; [McCann, Liza] Alder Hey Childrens NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Paediat Rheumatol, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Ozen, Seza] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Pediat, Ankara, Turkey; [Ravelli, Angelo] Univ Genoa, Genoa, Italy; [Ravelli, Angelo] Ist Giannina Gaslini, Genoa, Italy; [Uziel, Yosef] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Sch Med, Med Ctr, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Beresford, Michael W.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Translat Med, Dept Womens & Childrens Hlth, Liverpool, Merseyside, England";Groot, N (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Paediat Immunol, Lundlaan 6, NL-3584 EA Utrecht, Netherlands.;n.groot@erasmusmc.nl;"OZEN, SEZA/I-9096-2013; McCann, Liza/AAA-8311-2021; Kamphuis, Sylvia/AAJ-8195-2020; Marks, Stephen/AAH-6303-2019; Wulffraat, Nico M/AAE-8929-2020; Kone-paut, Isabelle/AAF-6296-2019; Beresford, Michael William/AAB-5261-2021";"Wulffraat, Nico M/0000-0001-9548-5562; Beresford, Michael William/0000-0002-5400-9911; de Graeff, Nienke/0000-0002-0045-4366";"EAHC [2011 1202]; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/M01665X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Rosetrees TrustRosetrees Trust [M465] Funding Source: researchfish; ReumaFonds [LLP-10] Funding Source: researchfish";"EAHC; grant number 2011 1202";;89;28;34;0;13;BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP;LONDON;BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND;0003-4967;1468-2060;;ANN RHEUM DIS;Ann.

Medline, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Three major pathophysiologic events were considered to constitute CIRCI: dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, altered cortisol metabolism, and tissue resistance to glucocorticoids. The dysregulation of the HPA axis is complex, involving multidirectional crosstalk between the CRH/ACTH pathways, autonomic nervous system, vasopressinergic system, and immune system. Recent studies have demonstrated that plasma clearance of cortisol is markedly reduced during critical illness, explained by suppressed expression and activity of the primary cortisol-metabolizing enzymes in the liver and kidney. Despite the elevated cortisol levels during critical illness, tissue resistance to glucocorticoids is believed to occur due to insufficient glucocorticoid alpha-mediated anti-inflammatory activity. Novel insights into the pathophysiology of CIRCI add to the limitations of the current diagnostic tools to identify at-risk patients and may also impact how corticosteroids are used in patients with CIRCI.;"[Annane, Djillali] Univ Versailles SQY Paris Saclay, Gen ICU Dept, Raymond Poincare Hosp, APHP,Hlth Sci Ctr Simone Veil, Garches, France; [Pastores, Stephen M.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, 1275 York Ave,C-1179, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Rochwerg, Bram] McMaster Univ, Dept Med, Div Crit Care, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Arlt, Wiebke] Univ Birmingham, IMSR, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Arlt, Wiebke] Birmingham Hlth Partners, Ctr Endocrinol Diabet & Metab CEDAM, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Balk, Robert A.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Beishuizen, Albertus] Med Spectrum Twente, Dept Intens Care Med, Enschede, Netherlands; [Briegel, Josef] Klinikum Univ, Klin Anasthesiol, Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, Munich, Germany; [Carcillo, Joseph] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Crit Care Med & Pediat, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Christ-Crain, Mirjam] Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Endocrinol Diabetol & Metab, Clin Res, Basel, Switzerland; [Cooper, Mark S.] Univ Sydney, Dept Endocrinol, Concord Hosp, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Marik, Paul E.] Eastern Virginia Med Sch, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, Norfolk, VA 23501 USA; [Meduri, Gianfranco Umberto] Memphis Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Div Pulm Crit Care & Sleep Med, Dept Med, Memphis, TN USA; [Olsen, Keith M.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Coll Pharm, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Rodgers, Sophia C.] Univ New Mexico, Clin Adjunct Fac, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Rodgers, Sophia C.] Sandoval Reg Med Ctr, Albuquerque, NM USA; [Russell, James A.] Univ British Columbia, Div Crit Care Med, Ctr Heart Lung Innovat, St Pauls Hosp, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Van den Berghe, Greet] KU Leuven Univ & Hosp, Clin Div, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Van den Berghe, Greet] KU Leuven Univ & Hosp, Lab Intens Care Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium";"Annane, D (corresponding author), Univ Versailles SQY Paris Saclay, Gen ICU Dept, Raymond Poincare Hosp, APHP,Hlth Sci Ctr Simone Veil, Garches, France.; Pastores, SM (corresponding author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, 1275 York Ave,C-1179, New York, NY 10065 USA.";"djillali.annane@aphp.fr; pastores@mskcc.org";"Rochwerg, Bram/AAE-7606-2020; Briegel, Josef/AAG-3774-2019";Christ-Crain, Mirjam/0000-0002-6336-0965;;;;85;39;42;0;3;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0342-4642;1432-1238;;INTENS CARE MED;Intensive Care Med.;DEC;2017;43;12;;;;;1781;1792;;10.1007/s00134-017-4914-x;;;12;Critical Care Medicine;General & Internal Medicine;FO8QR;WOS:000417152700003;28940017;Bronze, Green Published;;;2021-02-18;

Bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) data is generally used to determine mutagenic and possible carcinogenic potential of compounds. Recently, a publication on experiences of using two in silico systems to identify potentially mutagenic impurities highlighted the importance of performing a critical review of published Ames data utilized as part of a mutagenicity assessment of impurities (Greene et al., 2015). Four compounds (2-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2-amino-3-chlorobenzoic acid, methyl 2-amino-4-chlorobenzoate and 4-morpholinopyridine) reported mutagenic were identified in a two system in silico assessment and expert review of the structuresas non-mutagenic. Likely reasons for mutagenicity could not be identified and the purity of the compounds tested was proposed. In the current investigation, the purest available sample of the four compounds was tested in an OECD-compliant Ames test. The compounds were all found to be non-mutagenic. Possible reasons for the discrepancy between previously reported and current results are discussed. Additionally, important points to consider when conducting an expert review of available Ames data are provided particularly in cases where reported Ames results are discrepant with a two system in silico assessment.;"[Gunther, William C.; Kenyon, Michelle O.; Cheung, Jennifer R.; Dugger, Robert W.; Dobo, Krista L.] Pfizer Res & Dev, Groton, CT 06340 USA";Gunther, WC (corresponding author), Pfizer Res & Dev, Groton, CT 06340 USA.;william.c.gunther@pfizer.com;;;;;;21;4;4;2;7;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;0273-2300;1096-0295;;REGUL TOXICOL PHARM;Regul.

Many researchers discuss usability, usefulness, portability, and response time for the evolution of RBES. The final goal of all such studies is to construct a system with optimal, accurate knowledge base. Arguably, a system with best knowledge base is actually worthless if it is never utilized in the real world. We have proposed benefit as a measure of evaluation and suggested some guidelines for performance evaluation of RBESs. The proposed measure has been demonstrated for performance evaluation of an RBES applied in the medical billing domain. Results showed that the system has saved hundreds of working hours during the evaluation period of 3months. Moreover, other associated measures have also been considered. Associated measures in the medical billing domain are claim rejection ratereduced by 54%and claim aging, which has decreased from 34 to 28days due to the RBES.

Materials and methods: A survey was conducted with 13 radiation oncologists involved in the care of central nervous system tumor patients. The survey was comprised of 49 questions divided into 2 domains: a demographic section (10 questions) and a case section (5 re-RT cases with 5 to 6 questions representing one or several re-RT treatment dilemmas as may be encountered in the clinic). Respondents were asked to rate the relevance of various factors to offering re-RT, respond to the cases with a decision to offer re-RT vs. not, volume to be treated, margins to be employed, dose/fractionation suggested and any additional comments with respect to rationale in each scenario. Results: Sixty nine percent of responders have been practicing for greater than 10 years and 61% have re-RT 20 to 100 patients to date, with 54% seeing 2-5 re-RT cases per month and retreating 1-2 patients per month. Recurrent tumor volume, time since previous radiation therapy, previously administered dose to organs at risk and patient performance status were rated by the majority of responders (85%, 92%, 77%, and 69% respectively) as extremely relevant or very relevant to offering re-RT as an option. Conclusion: The experts' practice of re-RT is still heterogeneous, reflecting the paucity of high-quality prospective data available for decision-making. Nevertheless, practicing radiation oncologists can support own decisions by referring to the cases found suitable for re-RT in this survey.;"[Krauze, Andra; Rowe, Lindsay; Smart, Dee Dee; Camphausen, Kevin] NCI, Radiat Oncol Branch, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Attia, Albert] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Radiat Oncol, Nashville, TN USA; [Braunstein, Steve] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Radiat Oncol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Chan, Michael] Wake Forest Baptist Med Ctr, Dept Radiat Oncol, Winston Salem, NC USA; [Combs, Stephanie] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Radiat Oncol, Munich, Germany; [Combs, Stephanie] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Innovat Radiotherapy iRT, Dept Radiat Sci, Neuherberg, Germany; [Combs, Stephanie] DKTK, Partner Size, Munich, Germany; [Fietkau, Rainer] Dept Radiotherapy Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany; [Fiveash, John] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Radiat Oncol, Birmingham, AL USA; [Flickinger, John] UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Grosu, Anca] Univ Freiburg, Dept Radiat Oncol, Freiburg, Germany; [Howard, Steven] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Human Oncol, Madison, WI USA; [Nieder, Carsten] Hosp Trust, Dept Oncol & Palliat Med, N-8092 Bodo, Nordland, Norway; [Nieder, Carsten] Univ Tromso, Dept Clin Med, Fac Hlth Sci, N-9038 Tromso, Norway; [Niyazi, Maximilian] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Radiat Oncol, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Niyazi, Maximilian] German Canc Res Ctr, German Canc Consortium DKTK, Heidelberg, Germany; [Tsien, Christina] Washington Univ, Dept Radiat Oncol, St Louis, MO USA";Krauze, A (corresponding author), NCI, Radiat Oncol Branch, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.;andra.oprea@gmail.com;;;"Centers for Cancer Research, NCI [ZIASC 010372]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [ZIASC010372, ZIASC010372, ZIASC010372, ZIASC010372, ZIASC010372, ZIASC010372, ZIASC010372, ZIASC010372, ZIASC010372, ZIASC010372] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";This work was supported in part by the Centers for Cancer Research, NCI. # ZIASC 010372.;;20;14;14;0;3;BIOMED CENTRAL LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;1748-717X;;;RADIAT ONCOL;Radiat.

Purposes: To obtain graft site morbidity rates after tendon harvest for ulnar and lateral collateral ligament reconstruction procedures. Study Design: Systematic review/Meta-analysis. Methods: Studies were eligible if (1) patients had undergone elbow ligament reconstruction procedures; (2) original data for at least 5 patients were available; (3) the article was written in English, German, or Dutch; (4) a full-text article was available; and (5) information about graft site morbidity was available. The review excluded studies about complicated elbow ligament reconstruction procedures due to initial fractures, revision procedures, or circumferential graft techniques; animal studies; (systematic) reviews; and expert opinions. Because the majority of studies were case reports, no selection form or overall scoring system to evaluate methodological quality was used. Results: The review included 619 patients with an ulnar or lateral collateral ligament reconstruction procedure. The autograft types used included palmaris longus tendon (58%), gracilis tendon (24%), semitendinosus tendon (8%), triceps tendon (7%), toe extensor tendon (<2%), plantaris tendon (<2%), extensor carpi radialis longus tendon (<1%), and Achilles tendon (<1%).

More consistent terminology and plantation typologies are needed to enable comparability between plantation types and related ecological and socio-economic outcomes. Recent Findings Previous research has provided some suggestions for a plantation typology, but a more systematic approach to typology formulation is still needed. Furthermore, previously proposed typologies almost exclusively deal with plantation forestry, ignoring the links with other plantation types. Summary The aim of this review is to identify a comprehensive set of variables that can describe the range of different plantation types, specifically (but not exclusively) in the context of forestry. The typology was developed based on a participatory and iterative analytical process involving several expert stakeholders. The variables that contribute to constructing the typology are presented and explained in light of their influence on ecological and socio-economic outcomes. Variables include the following: (1) characteristics of planted organism (tree/non-tree), (2) species composition (monoculture/mixed), (3) origin of planted species (native/exotic), (4) plantation purpose (economic, social and environmental), (5) plantation intended use (provisioning, regulating and cultural services), (6) land ownership (public and private), (7) management responsibility (public and private), (8) management intensity (high-medium-low), (9) scale (large-medium-small) and composition (monoculture/mixed) in landscape, (10) original initiator of plantation establishment (external and internal) and (11) level of institutional arrangements (high-medium-low). The typology is then tested using three case studies. A code system is presented that scholars and practitioners can use to classify plantation types and provide the basis to aid further analyses.;"[D'Amato, D.; Malkamaki, A.] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, Latokartanonkaari 7, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [D'Amato, D.] Aalto Univ, Sch Business, Dept Management Studies, Lapuankatu 2, Helsinki 00101, Finland; [Hogarth, N.

The MDEpiNet SMART Think Tank, held in February, 2013, sought to engage expert stakeholders who were committed to improving the capture of device data, including Unique Device Identification (UDI), in key electronic health information. Prior to the Think Tank there was limited collaboration among stakeholders beyond a few single health care organizations engaged in electronic capture and exchange of device data. The Think Tank resulted in what has become two sustainable multi-stakeholder device data capture initiatives, BUILD and VANGUARD. These initiatives continue to mature within the MDEpiNet PPP structure and are well aligned with the goals outlined in recent FDA-initiated National Medical Device Planning Board and Medical Device Registry Task Force white papers as well as the vision for the National Evaluation System for health Technology.%.;"[Reed, Terrie L.; Marinac-Dabic, Danica] US FDA, Silver Spring, MD USA; [Drozda, Joseph P., Jr.] Mercy Hlth Syst, Chesterfield, MO USA; [Baskin, Kevin M.] Soc Intervent Radiol, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Tcheng, James; Krucoff, Mitchell W.] Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Conway, Karen] Global Healthcare Exchange, Louisville, CO USA; [Wilson, Natalia] Arizona State Univ, Phoenix, AZ USA; [Heise, Theodore] Cook Med, Bloomington, IN USA";Reed, TL (corresponding author), US FDA, CDRH, OSB, Bldg 66,Room 3324, Silver Spring, MD 20903 USA.;terrie.reed@fda.hhs.gov;Heise, Theodore/L-1840-2018;Heise, Theodore/0000-0002-0341-0430;;;;21;5;5;1;14;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;2213-0764;2213-0772;;HEALTHCARE-J DEL SCI;HealthCare;DEC;2017;5;4;;;;;158;164;;10.1016/j.hjdsi.2016.10.004;;;7;"Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services";Health Care Sciences & Services;FO5ZI;WOS:000416940300002;27939170;;;;2021-02-18;

Most research thus far has been mainly carried out on large-scale tests, e.g., Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), Michigan English Language Assessment Battery (MELAB), International English Language Testing System (IELTS), etc. In particular, CDA of formative language assessment that aims to inform instruction and to discover strengths and weaknesses of students to guide instruction has not been conducted in a foreign (i.e., second) language-learning context. This study explored how developing a reading comprehension test based on a cognitive framework could be used for such diagnostic purposes. To achieve this, initially, a list of 9 reading attributes was prepared by experts based on the literature, and then the targeted attributes were used to construct a 20-item reading comprehension test. Second, a tentative Q-matrix that specified the relationships between test items and the target attributes required by each item was developed. Third, the test was administered to seven language-testing experts who were asked to identify which of the 9 attributes were required by each item of the test. Fourth, on the basis of the overall agreement of the experts' judgments concerning the choices of attributes, review of the literature and results of student think-aloud protocols, the tentative Q-Matrix was refined and used for statistical analyses. Finally, the test was administered to 1986 students of a General English Language Course at the University of Tehran, Iran. To examine the CDA of the test, the Reparameterized Unified Model (RUM) (also known as the Fusion Model), a type of cognitive diagnostic measurement model (CDM), was used for further refining the Q-Matrix for future data analyses and, most importantly, for diagnosing the participants' strengths and weaknesses. Data analysis results confirmed that the nine proposed reading attributes are involved in the reading comprehension test items. Such diagnostic information could be helpful for teachers and practitioners to prepare instructional materials that target specific weaknesses and inform them of the more problematic areas that need to be emphasized in class in order to plan for better L2 reading instruction. Further, such information could inform individualized student instruction and produce improved diagnostic tests for future use.;"[Ranjbaran, Fatemeh; Alavi, Seyyed Mohammed] Univ Tehran, Dept Foreign Languages & Literature, Tehran, Iran";Ranjbaran, F (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Dept Foreign Languages & Literature, Tehran, Iran.;franjbaran@ut.ac.ir;;Ranjbaran, Fatemeh/0000-0001-9326-4475;;;;59;2;2;3;23;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0191-491X;;;STUD EDUC EVAL;Stud.

The theoretical backdrop of this contribution is formed by the findings from the international discussion on the impact orientation of time banks that ascribe to them a certain importance for social inclusion, to strengthen communities and to mitigate the negative effects of economic deprivation. This paper investigates if and to what extent the findings for the Zeit-Hilfs-Netz Steiermark (founded in 2011) fit in the international results. For this purpose, data on membership, offer advertisements and on demand as well as the latest network meeting result protocol have been analysed. Additionally, the responsible staff members of the Landentwicklung Steiermark as well as the coordinators of the local time bank groups have been surveyed. The analysis of the result protocol of the latest network meeting confirms the validity of the subjective estimations of the experts. Empirical data show that women and people aged 50 to 69 years form the backbone of the Zeit-Hilfs-Netz Steiermark. Barter activities are less important than joint activities and there is no reciprocity or rather mutual exchange. Nevertheless, this time bank has positive case-by-case effects on the subjective quality of life of the (active) participants. The future existence of the Zeit-HilfsNetz Steiermark and its impacts on securing livelihoods is closely tied to stable basic infrastructures at the local level, professional support and a clear portfolio.;"[Fischer, Tatjana; Himmelbauer, Paul] Univ Bodenkultur Wien, Inst Raumplanung Umweltplanung & Bodenordnung, Dept Raum Landschaft & Infrastruktur, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Jobst, Markus] Tech Univ Wien, Dept Geodasie & Geoinformat, Erzherzog Johann Pl 1-120-6, A-1040 Vienna, Austria";Fischer, T (corresponding author), Univ Bodenkultur Wien, Inst Raumplanung Umweltplanung & Bodenordnung, Dept Raum Landschaft & Infrastruktur, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.;"tatjana.fischer@boku.ac.at; paul.himmelbauer@boku.ac.at; markus@jobstmedia.at";"Jobst, Markus/R-4018-2019; Jobst, Markus/AAP-3764-2020";Jobst, Markus/0000-0001-5937-8858;University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU);Open access funding provided by University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU).;;50;0;0;0;2;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;0034-0111;1869-4179;;RAUMFORSCH RAUMORDN;Raumforsch.

One device which has recently become available is the Percutaneous Achilles Repair System (PARS), which uses both locking and nonlocking sutures for Achilles tendon rupture repair. This article presents techniques using double locking or 2 locked repair sutures in each tendon, along with the standard repair technique. An important component of these techniques is anatomic positioning of the PARS, keeping the arms parallel to the Achilles tendon and properly externally rotated using the results of a magnetic resonance imaging study to improve tendon capture. Early studies have shown good clinical outcomes and suggest that minimally invasive techniques such as the PARS are clinically and biomechanically suitable alternatives to open repair for Achilles tendon ruptures.Level of Evidence: Diagnostic Level V, expert opinion.

However, patients undergoing AF ablation are usually anticoagulated, thus making the presence of thrombus unlikely in most cases. This study aimed to determine whether the CHA(2)DS(2)VASc scoring system can be used to identify patients that do not require TOE prior to AF ablation. In this single-centre retrospective study, local institutional and primary care databases and electronic patient records were searched to identify patients that had undergone TOE prior to AF ablation. Patient demographics, CHA(2)DS(2)VASc score, TOE findings and anticoagulation status were collected for analysis. Over a 7-year period (2008-2014), 332 patients (age 57 +/- 10 years; 74% male) underwent TOE prior to proposed AF ablation. CHA(2)DS(2)VASc scores of 0, 1, 2 and >2 were found in 39, 34, 15 and 12% of patients, respectively. The prevalence of LAA thrombus was 0.6% (2 patients) and these 2 patients had risk scores of 2 and 4. No patients with a score of 0 or 1 had LAA thrombus. Patients that are classed as low risk by the CHA2DS2VASc score do not require a pre-ablation TOE to screen for LAA thrombus provided they are adequately anticoagulated. This would lead to a significant reduction in health care expenditures by reducing unnecessary TOE requests and thereby improve patient experience.";"[Atkinson, Charlotte; Hinton, Jonathan; Gaisie, Edmund B.; Yue, Arthur M.; Roberts, Paul R.; Rakhit, Dhrubo J.; Shah, Benoy N.] Univ Hosp Southampton, Dept Cardiol, Southampton, Hants, England";Shah, BN (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Southampton, Dept Cardiol, Southampton, Hants, England.;benoy.shah@uhs.nhs.uk;;;;;;29;2;2;0;1;BIOSCIENTIFICA LTD;BRISTOL;EURO HOUSE, 22 APEX COURT WOODLANDS, BRADLEY STOKE, BRISTOL BS32 4JT, ENGLAND;2055-0464;;;ECHO RES PRACT;Echo Res.

However, it remains unclear whether this automated adaptive analytics algorithm, derived from a 'training' population, can encompass adequate echo images in Chinese adolescents. Objectives: The aim of our study was to explore the accuracy of HeartModel in adolescents compared with expert manual three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography. Methods: Fifty-three Chinese adolescent subjects with or without heart disease underwent 3D echocardiographic imaging with an EPIQ system (Philips). 3D cardiac volumes and LVEF obtained with the automated HeartModel program were compared with manual 3D echocardiographic measurements by an experienced echocardiographer. Results: There was strong correlation between HeartModel and expert manual 3DE measurements (r = 0.875-0.965, all P < 0.001). Automated LV and left atrial (LA) volumes were slightly overestimated when compared to expert manual measurements, while LVEF showed no significant differences from the manual method. Importantly, the intra-and inter-observer variability of automated 3D echocardiographic model was relatively low (<1%), surpassing the manual approach (3.5-17.4%), yet requiring significantly less analyzing time (20 +/- 7 vs 177 +/- 30 s, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Simultaneous quantification of left heart volumes and LVEF with the automated HeartModel program is rapid, accurate and reproducible in Chinese adolescent cohort. Therefore, it has a potential to bring 3D echocardiographic assessment of left heart chamber volumes and function into busy pediatric practice.;"[Luo, Xiu-Xia] Southern Med Univ, Shenzhen Hosp, Dept Ultrasonog, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Luo, Xiu-Xia; Liu, Chao; Lee, Alex Pui-Wai] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Div Cardiol, Dept Med & Therapeut, Prince Wales Hosp,Fac Med, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Fang, Fang] Capital Med Univ, Beijing Anzhen Hosp, Beijing Inst Heart Lung & Blood Vessel Dis, Beijing, Peoples R China; [So, Hung-Kwan; Yam, Man-Ching] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Pediat, Prince Wales Hosp, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";Lee, APW (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Div Cardiol, Dept Med & Therapeut, Prince Wales Hosp,Fac Med, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;alexpwlee@cuhk.edu.hk;Lee, Alex Pui-Wai/E-9217-2013;Lee, Alex Pui-Wai/0000-0002-4120-155X;"Health and Medical Research Fund [12131351]; Food and Health Bureau, Hong Kong SAR Government, Peoples' Republic of China";This research project was supported by the Health and Medical Research Fund (Ref No.: 12131351), Food and Health Bureau, Hong Kong SAR Government, Peoples' Republic of China.;;32;5;7;0;3;BIOSCIENTIFICA LTD;BRISTOL;EURO HOUSE, 22 APEX COURT WOODLANDS, BRADLEY STOKE, BRISTOL BS32 4JT, ENGLAND;2055-0464;;;ECHO RES PRACT;Echo Res.

The importance and role of specialists on audit engagements have recently increased, and specialist use has garnered significant attention from regulators and academics. Given the PCAOB's (2017b) recent proposal to revise auditing standards regarding specialists' involvement, it is important to review the specialist literature as a whole. By integrating research across these four domains, I identify commonalities and differences related to: (1) factors associated with the use of specialists on audit engagements (including the nature, timing, and extent of use); (2) factors impacting auditors' interactions with specialists (including specialists contracted by the auditor or management); and (3) outcomes associated with the use of specialists. This integrated analysis of the specialist literatures shows variation in the use of specialists, and various factors affecting both if and how they are involved and whether auditors use specialists internal or external to the audit firm. Additionally, research has sometimes (but not always) linked specialist involvement to higher audit quality. The commonalities and areas of variation identified are informative to audit research and practice, particularly as regulators and audit firms look to improve the quality of audits using specialists. Throughout the synthesis, I also provide a number of directions for future research.";[Hux, Candice T.] Northern Illinois Univ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA;Hux, CT (corresponding author), Northern Illinois Univ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.;chux@niu.edu;;;;;;89;11;11;2;17;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA;0737-4607;;;J ACCOUNT LIT;J.

Domain selection criteria included face validity, comprehensiveness, and structural independence. First, 9 health outcomes measurement experts selected domains appropriate for a general health measure using a modified Delphi procedure. Second, 50 adult community members assessed structural independence of domain pairs. For each pair, the participant was asked if it were possible to have simultaneously good functioning in domain 1 but poor functioning in domain 2, and vice versa. The community members also rated the relative importance of the domains. Finally, the experts selected domains, guided by community members' judgments of structural independence and importance. After 3 rounds of surveys, the experts agreed on 10 potential domains. The percent of pairs deemed structurally independent by community members ranged from 50 to 95 (mean = 78). Physical Function, Pain Interference, and Depression were retained because of their inclusion in existing preference-based measures and their importance to community members. Four other domains were added because they were important to community members and judged to be independent by at least 67% of respondents: Cognitive Function-Abilities; Fatigue; Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities; and Sleep Disturbance.

The main causes for differences of interests can be variations in subjective preferences and organizational differences. Subjective preferences are due to the values held by those involved. These values are of an intrinsic nature and therefore difficult to change. Another reason for individual goals is that hospitals and universities are professional bureaucracies. Experts working in professional bureaucracies are known to identify themselves to a greater extent with their respective profession than with their institution; however, teams in the operating room (OR) have to work together in multidisciplinary teams. The main goal of this analysis is to document role-specific targets and motivations within teams. This was a case study at a university hospital with 40 operating rooms. The data collection resulted from the three pillars of the goal documentation instrument, which includes expert interviews, a utility analysis and card placement as a basis for communicative validation. The results were analyzed with a systematic method as a qualitative content analysis. The four-pillar success model, which maps aspects of a successful hospital, was used as a deductive coding scheme. The four pillars represent the level of medical quality (process, structure and outcome quality), economy and efficiency, client satisfaction (patients and referring physicians) and employee satisfaction. At a university hospital an additional focus is on research and teaching. In addition to the four pillar success model as a deductive coding scheme, an inductive coding scheme was introduced. Approximately 10% of the employees from each professional group (surgeons, anesthesiologists, OR nurses, nurse anesthetists) were interviewed resulting in 65 interviews overall. The interviews were conducted within a time span of 4 months. Considering the main categories quality of medical care, economy and efficiency, patient satisfaction and employee satisfaction as well as research and teaching, surgeons thought the categories of economy and efficiency (37%) and quality of medical care (34%) to be the most important. For anesthesiologists, however, the category of employee satisfaction (38%) was most important, followed by the category of economy and efficiency (31%). For the OR nurses as well as for the nurse anesthetists the category of employee satisfaction was of highest priority (61% and 57%, respectively). The results show that considering the main categories no dimension is equally important for the participating professional groups. This can result in goal conflicts. Additionally, the ad hoc teams make it impossible for team building to occur, making it difficult for the professional groups to adapt to each other and the individual goals. This presents a high potential for conflict. The difference in the perception of the importance of employee satisfaction is a crucial factor for emerging conflicts in the OR, as employee satisfaction correlates with productivity and patient satisfaction. Knowing and communicating the different goals is a first step for optimizing the OR management system.";"[Hoeper, K.; Kriependorf, M.; Tecklenburg, A.] Hannover Med Sch, ISAK, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Felix, C.; Nyhuis, P.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Fabr Anlagen & Logist IFA, Hannover, Germany";Hoeper, K (corresponding author), Hannover Med Sch, ISAK, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.;Hoeper.Kirsten@mh-hannover.de;;;;;;27;1;1;0;12;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0003-2417;1432-055X;;ANAESTHESIST;Anaesthesist;DEC;2017;66;12;;;;;953;960;;10.1007/s00101-017-0380-7;;;8;Anesthesiology;Anesthesiology;FO1OP;WOS:000416532800008;29085962;;;;2021-02-18;

This may reduce the need for random biopsies to detect more dysplasia. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of magnification endoscopy with I-SCAN (Pentax, Tokyo, Japan) and acetic acid (ACA) on dysplasia detection in BE using a novel mucosal and vascular classification system. Methods BE segments and suspicious lesions were recorded with high definition white-light and magnification endoscopy enhanced using all I-SCAN modes in combination. We created a novel mucosal and vascular classification system based on similar previously validated classifications for narrow-band imaging (NBI). A total of 27 videos were rated before and after ACA application. Following validation, a further 20 patients had their full endoscopies recorded and analyzed to model use of the system to detect dysplasia in a routine clinical scenario. Results The accuracy of the I-SCAN classification system for BE dysplasia improved with I-SCAN magnification from 69% to 79% post-ACA (P = 0.01). In the routine clinical scenario model in 20 new patients, accuracy of dysplasia detection increased from 76% using a pull-through alone to 83% when ACA and magnification endoscopy were combined (P = 0.047). Overall interobserver agreement between experts for dysplasia detection was substantial (0.69). Conclusions A new I-SCAN classification system for BE was validated against similar systems for NBI with similar outcomes.

The Emprint T SX Ablation Platform employs real-time 3D-electromagnetic spatial antenna tracking to generate intraoperative laparoscopic antenna guidance. We sought to determine whether Emprint T SX affected time/accuracy of antenna-placement in a laparoscopic training model. Methods: Targets (7-10 mm) were set in agar within a laparoscopic training device. Novices (no surgical experience), intermediates (surgical residents), and experts (HPB-surgeons) were asked to locate and hit targets using a MWA antenna (10-ultrasound only, 10-Emprint T SX). Time to locate target, number of attempts to hit the target, first-time hit rate, and time from initiating antenna advance to hitting the target were measured. Results: Participants located 100% of targets using ultrasound, with experts taking significantly less time than novices and intermediates. Using ultrasound only, successful hit-rates were 70% for novices and 90% for intermediates and experts. Using Emprint T SX, successful hit rates for all 3-groups were 100%, with significantly increased first-time hit-rates and reduced time required to hit targets compared to ultrasound only. Discussion: Emprint T SX significantly improved accuracy and speed of antenna-placement independent of experience, and was particularly beneficial for novice users.;"[Sastry, Amit V.; Swet, Jacob H.; Murphy, Keith J.; Baker, Erin H.; Vrochides, Dionisios; Martinie, John B.; McKillop, Iain H.; Iannitti, David A.] Carolinas Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Div Hepatopancreatobiliary Surg, Charlotte, NC 28203 USA";McKillop, IH (corresponding author), Carolinas Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Div Hepatopancreatobiliary Surg, Charlotte, NC 28203 USA.;Iain.McKillop@carolinashealthcare.org;Vrochides, Dionisios/AAD-3314-2019;Vrochides, Dionisios/0000-0002-2362-7573;Medtronic, Minneapolis, MNMedtronic;Funded, in part, by an unrestricted educational grant from Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN.;;35;5;5;0;4;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1365-182X;1477-2574;;HPB;HPB;DEC;2017;19;12;;;;;1066;1073;;10.1016/j.hpb.2017.08.001;;;8;"Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Surgery";"Gastroenterology & Hepatology; Surgery";FO0NX;WOS:000416442700004;28917643;Bronze;;;2021-02-18;

This study investigated the validation of a new set of measures in terms of providing a procedure for knowledge management-oriented innovation that enriches the hospital management system. Methods: The relation between innovation and all the knowledge management areas, as the main constructs of project management, was illustrated by referring to project management standard steps and previous studies. Through consultations and meetings with a committee of professional project managers, a questionnaire was developed to measure ten knowledge management areas in hospital's innovation process. Additionally, a group of experts from hospital managers were invited to comment on the applicability of the questionnaires by considering if the items are measurable in hospitals practically. Results: A close-ended, Likert-type scale items, consisted of ten sections, were developed based on project management body of knowledge thorough Delphi technique. It enables the managers to evaluate hospitals' situation to be aware whether the organization follows the knowledge management standards in innovation process or not. By pilot study, confirmatory factor analysis and exploratory factor analysis were conducted to ensure the validity and reliability of the measurement items. Conclusion: The developed items seem to have a potential to help hospital managers and subsequently delivering new products/services successfully based on the standard procedures in their organization. In all innovation processes, the knowledge management areas and their standard steps help hospital managers by a new tool as questionnaire format.;"[Ghasemi, Matina] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, TRNC, Fac Tourism, Famagusta, Turkey; [Ghadiri Nejad, Mazyar] Islamic Azad Univ, South Tehran Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Tehran, Iran; [Bagzibagli, Kemal] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, TRNC, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Famagusta, Turkey";Ghasemi, M (corresponding author), Eastern Mediterranean Univ, TRNC, Fac Tourism, Famagusta, Turkey.;matina.ghasemi@emu.edu.tr;Nejad, Mazyar Ghadiri/K-5320-2018;Nejad, Mazyar Ghadiri/0000-0002-8207-2387;;;;45;6;6;0;15;IRANIAN SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY;TEHRAN;SCHOOL PUBLIC HEALTH & INST HEALTH RESEARCH, TEHRAN UNIV MEDICAL SCIENCES, P O BOX  6446-14155, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN;2251-6085;2251-6093;;IRAN J PUBLIC HEALTH;Iran J.

The religious beliefs of nurses may affect their competence to provide spiritual care to patients. No reliable and valid instruments are currently available to measure the religious beliefs of nurses in Taiwan. Purposes: The aims of this study were to develop a religious belief scale (RBS) for Taiwanese nurses and to evaluate the psychometric properties of this scale. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used, and 24 RBS items were generated from in-depth interviews, a literature review, and expert recommendations. The RBS self-administered questionnaire was provided to 619 clinical nurses, who were recruited from two medical centers and one local hospital in Taiwan during 2011-2012. A calibration sample was used to explore the factor structure, whereas a validation sample was used to validate the factor structure that was constructed by the calibration sample. Known-group validity and criterion-related validity were also assessed. Results: An exploratory factor analysis resulted in an 18-item RBS with four factors, including religious effects, divine, religious query, and religious stress. A confirmatory factor analysis recommended the deletion of one item, resulting in a final RBS of 17 items. The convergent validity and discriminate validity of the RBS were acceptable. The RBS correlated positively with spiritual health and supported concurrent validity. The known-group validity was supported by showing that the mean RBS between nurses with or without religious affiliation was significant. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: The 17-item RBS developed in this study is a reliable, valid, and useful scale for measuring the religious beliefs of nurses in Taiwan. This scale may help measure the religious beliefs of nurses and elicit the relationship between these beliefs and spirituality.;"[Chiang, Yi-Chien; Lee, Hsiang-Chun; Han, Chin-Yen; Hsiao, Ya-Chu] Chang Gung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Nursing, Linkou, Taiwan; [Chiang, Yi-Chien] Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Pediat, Linkou, Taiwan; [Chu, Tsung-Lan; Han, Chin-Yen; Hsiao, Ya-Chu] Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Nursing, Linkou, Taiwan; [Hsiao, Ya-Chu] Chang Gung Univ, Dept Nursing, Linkou, Taiwan";Hsiao, YC (corresponding author), 261,Wenhua 1st Rd, Taoyuan 33303, Taiwan.;yjshiao@gw.cgust.edu.tw;;Han, Chin-Yen/0000-0002-7464-7507;"Ministry of Science and Technology TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 100-2410-H-255-001, NSC 102-2511-S-255-003-MY2, MOST 104-2511-S-255-008]; Chang Gung Medical Research Fund [CMRPF1C0081, CMRPF1C0082, BMRP704, BMRPA63]";This study was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology Taiwan (NSC 100-2410-H-255-001, NSC 102-2511-S-255-003-MY2, and MOST 104-2511-S-255-008) and the Chang Gung Medical Research Fund (CMRPF1C0081, CMRPF1C0082, BMRP704, and BMRPA63).

The aims of this paper are to offer an exhaustive validation of an accurate semiautomatic segmentation tool to delimitate retroperitoneal tumors from CT images and to aid physicians in planning both radiotherapy doses and surgery. A panel of 6 experts manually segmented 11 cases of tumors, and the segmentation results were compared exhaustively with: the results provided by a surgical planning tool (AYRA), the segmentations obtained using a radiotherapy treatment planning system (Pinnacle), the segmentation results obtained by a group of experts in the delimitation of retroperitoneal tumors and the segmentation results using the algorithm under validation. 11 cases of retroperitoneal tumors were tested. The proposed algorithm provided accurate results regarding the segmentation of the tumor. Moreover, the algorithm requires minimal computational time-an average of 90.5% less than that required when manually contouring the same tumor. A method developed for the semiautomatic selection of retroperitoneal tumor has been validated in depth.

Then, an innovative method to capture color at selected points is presented and complexion-aggregated analysis is performed. This innovative method is an extension of face-recognition theory. Images in RGB format are converted to CIELAB format during data collection and then Fuzzy C-means theory is used to cluster and group the data. The results are classified and grouped in Lab value and RGB index. Two programs are created. The first program, FaceRGB, captures color automatically from images.

Participants: A multi-specialty task force of international experts in critical care medicine and endocrinology and members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Data Sources: Medline, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Results: Three major pathophysiologic events were considered to constitute CIRCI: dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, altered cortisol metabolism, and tissue resistance to glucocorticoids. The dysregulation of the HPA axis is complex, involving multidirectional crosstalk between the CRH/ACTH pathways, autonomic nervous system, vasopressinergic system, and immune system. Recent studies have demonstrated that plasma clearance of cortisol is markedly reduced during critical illness, explained by suppressed expression and activity of the primary cortisol-metabolizing enzymes in the liver and kidney. Despite the elevated cortisol levels during critical illness, tissue resistance to glucocorticoids is believed to occur due to insufficient glucocorticoid alpha-mediated anti-inflammatory activity. Conclusions: Novel insights into the pathophysiology of CIRCI add to the limitations of the current diagnostic tools to identify at-risk patients and may also impact how corticosteroids are used in patients with CIRCI.;"[Annane, Djillali] Univ Versailles SQY Paris Saclay, Raymond Poincare Hosp, AP HP, Gen ICU Dept,Hlth Sci Ctr Simone Veil, Garches, France; [Pastores, Stephen M.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Arlt, Wiebke] Univ Birmingham, IMSR, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Arlt, Wiebke] Birmingham Hlth Partners, Ctr Endocrinol Diabet & Metab CEDAM, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Balk, Robert A.] Rush Univ, Med Ctr, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Beishuizen, Albertus] Med Spectrum Twente, Dept Intens Care Med, Enschede, Netherlands; [Briegel, Josef] Klinikum Univ, Klin Anasthesiol, Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, Munich, Germany; [Carcillo, Joseph] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Crit Care Med & Pediat, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Christ-Crain, Mirjam] Univ Hosp Basel, Dept Endocrinol Diabetol & Metab, Dept Clin Res, Basel, Switzerland; [Cooper, Mark S.] Univ Sydney, Concord Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Marik, Paul E.] Eastern Virginia Med Sch, Div Pulm & Crit Care Med, Norfolk, VA 23501 USA; [Meduri, Gianfranco Umberto] Memphis Vet Affairs Med Ctr, Dept Med, Div Pulm Crit Care & Sleep Med, Memphis, TN USA; [Olsen, Keith M.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Coll Pharm, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Rochwerg, Bram] McMaster Univ, Div Crit Care, Dept Med, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Rodgers, Sophia C.] Univ New Mexico, Clin Adjunct Fac, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Rodgers, Sophia C.] Sandoval Reg Med Ctr, Albuquerque, NM USA; [Russell, James A.] Univ British Columbia, St Pauls Hosp, Div Crit Care Med, Ctr Heart Lung Innovat, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Van den Berghe, Greet] KU Leuven Univ & Hosp, Clin Div, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Van den Berghe, Greet] KU Leuven Univ & Hosp, Lab Intens Care Med, Dept Cellular & Mol Med, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium";Pastores, SM (corresponding author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol & Crit Care Med, New York, NY 10021 USA.;pastores@mskcc.org;"Annane, Djillali/R-7947-2019; Arlt, Wiebke/B-6310-2009; Marik, Paul E/U-9733-2019; Van den Berghe, Greet/J-6788-2018; Briegel, Josef/AAG-3774-2019; Rochwerg, Bram/AAE-7606-2020";"Arlt, Wiebke/0000-0001-5106-9719; Van den Berghe, Greet/0000-0002-5320-1362; Christ-Crain, Mirjam/0000-0002-6336-0965; Cooper, Mark/0000-0003-3112-7728";;;;85;25;26;0;11;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;0090-3493;1530-0293;;CRIT CARE MED;Crit.

Our consortium developed and tested a novel adaptive AP in an outpatient, single-arm, uncontrolled multicenter clinical trial lasting 12 weeks. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Thirty adults with T1D completed a continuous glucose monitor (CGM)-augmented 1-week sensor-augmented pump (SAP) period. After the AP was started, basal insulin delivery settings used by the AP for initialization were adapted weekly, and carbohydrate ratios were adapted every 4 weeks by an algorithm running on a cloud-based server, with automatic data upload from devices. Adaptations were reviewed by expert study clinicians and patients. The primary end point was change in hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)). Outcomes are reported adhering to consensus recommendations on reporting of AP trials. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients completed the trial. HbA(1c), 7.0 0.8% at the start of AP use, improved to 6.7 +/- 0.6% after 12 weeks (-0.3, 95% CI -0.5 to -0.2, P < 0.001). Compared with the SAP run-in, CGM time spent in the hypoglycemic range improved during the day from 5.0 to 1.9% (-3.1, 95% CI -4.1 to -2.1, P < 0.001) and overnight from 4.1 to 1.1% (-3.1, 95% CI -4.2 to -1.9, P < 0.001). Whereas carbohydrate ratios were adapted to a larger extent initially with minimal changes thereafter, basal insulin was adapted throughout. Approximately 10% of adaptation recommendations were manually overridden. There were no protocol-related serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS Use of our novel adaptive AP yielded significant reductions in HbA(1c) and hypoglycemia.;"[Dassau, Eyal; Gondhalekar, Ravi; Sanz, Alejandro J.

Due to inadequate retrieval information at initial stacking, shuffle moves can occur during retrieval operations as containers may be stacked in a sequence which does not correspond to the actual retrieval sequence. Automated stacking cranes can perform re-marshalling during periods of no crane workload to shift unproductive moves during retrieval operations to phases of idle time. Terminal appointment systems (TAS) enhance landside sequence information when external trucks (XT) announce their arrival beforehand. Under these circumstances, it is beneficial for terminal planers to understand the effects of using re-marshalling in combination with TAS. The purpose of this work is to introduce an online rule-based solution method for the re-marshalling problem with and without TAS. A simulation model of a fully operating yard block is used as environment to compare the proposed method with a benchmark heuristic from the literature. All tests are conducted for single and multiple Rail-Mounted-Gantry-Crane systems with different yard block sizes. It is also shown that solving the re-marshalling problem with the proposed algorithm generates results that reduce shuffle moves by 30% on average and by up to 50% in the best case, while always performing better in the worst case in comparison with not performing re-marshalling. Afterwards, influences on the method of selected TAS parameters are evaluated numerically. Results show that imprecise XT arrival information, not deviating above a certain threshold, significantly contribute to reducing congestion by mitigating XT waiting time and levelling arrival peaks. These benefits can be achieved without imposing restrictions on the arrival schedule preferred by XT companies.;[Covic, Filip] Univ Hamburg, Inst Operat Res, HBS Hamburg Business Sch, Moorweidenstr 18, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany;Covic, F (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Operat Res, HBS Hamburg Business Sch, Moorweidenstr 18, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.;filip.covic@uni-hamburg.de;;;;;;30;5;5;6;35;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1936-6582;1936-6590;;FLEX SERV MANUF J;Flex.

However, they welcome higher productivity as a determinant parameter in scheduling and financial success of construction project. Therefore, construction productivity improvement can be employed as an incentive to persuade contractors for implementing sustainability mechanisms in construction project. On the other hand, sustainability is a comprehensive concept which requires system thinking for implementation. Therefore, this study developed a qualitative System Dynamics model to contribute to measuring sustainability performance of construction project, considering contractors' tendency to productivity. Sustainability performance is examined in three aspects of economic, social and environmental by introducing different subsystems and feedback loops. These loops formed based on experts' opinions about causal links among the factors affecting construction sustainability and productivity.

MethodsThe facial signs of two cohorts of French women (N= 40 and 42), of comparable ages were graded between winter to summer. One group was left unprotected whereas the other daily applied a strong photo-protective product for 6 months. Facial signs (structural and pigmentation-related) were graded in blind by a panel of 12 experts from photographs taken under standard conditions. A global and focused analysis of the skin colour or dark spots, when present, was carried out through spectro-radiometry under diffuse and standardized visible light, using the L*, a*, b* referential system. ResultsThe unprotected group showed significant changes in summer as compared to winter on 10 facial signs (two-third of the studied signs) that presented an increased severity, of variable respective amplitude. Five signs among the 10 were particularly and significantly affected by the seasonal transition, of an amplitude above the precision of the grading scale. Three of these five signs concerned structural elements (wrinkles), the two others being related to vascular disorders (redness). These season-induced alterations appear efficiently reduced in the photo-protected group. The colour of the facial skin then appears more homogeneous, less red, less dull, all criteria being quantified by the L*, a*, b* referential system. The comparison with a previous work carried out on Chinese women, through a similar protocol, shows that the photo-protective product brings, in Caucasian women, a more important effect upon structural and vascular features than upon pigmentation disorders, inversely to the results previously observed in Chinese women. ConclusionThe alterations in some facial signs occurring in a 6-month period between winter and summer are confirmed in Caucasian women, mostly related to structural (wrinkles) and vascular elements. Such changes appear alleviated or prevented by daily applications of a strong sun photo-protective product.;"[Flament, F.; Gautier, B.; Benize, A. -M.; Cassier, M.] LOreal Res & Innovat, 188-200 Rue Paul Hochart, F-94550 Chevilly Larue, France; [Charbonneau, A.] Eurosyn, 16 Ave Quebec,Bat Muscari ZA Courtaboeuf, F-91140 Villebon Sur Yvette, France";Flament, F (corresponding author), LOreal Res & Innovat, 9 Rue Pierre Dreyfus, F-92110 Clichy, France.;fflament@rd.loreal.com;;;L'Oreal Research & Innovation Department;The present work was entirely funded by the L'Oreal Research & Innovation Department.;;26;4;4;0;2;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0142-5463;1468-2494;;INT J COSMETIC SCI;Int.

Different sources of uncertainty exist in this model, including deficient, missing, and noisy data, conflicting water quality parameters and subjective information. Hourly and monthly data from Quebec City WDN are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed neuro-fuzzy model. Also, historical data from 52 sampling locations of Quebec City network is utilized to develop the rule-based model in order to train the neural network. Water quality is evaluated by categorizing quality parameters in two groups including microbial and physicochemical. Two sets of rules are defined using expert knowledge to assign water quality grades to each sampling location in the WDN. The fuzzy inference system outputs are deffuzzified using a similarity measure algorithm in this approach. The fuzzy inference system acts as a decision making agent. A utility function provides microbial and physicochemical water quality indices. Final results are used to train the neural network.

Data from Zhenyuan County of Gansu province (ZYC) between 2000 and 2012 was used as a case study of the theory. The SADE of ZYC was [0.34, 0.90], and the agriculture system exhibited low sustainability from 2000 to 2003, mid sustainability from 2004 to 2007, and high sustainability from 2008 to 2012. The results explained the actual ZYC situation, and showed that the Euclidean distance method of sustainable agricultural development is feasible. The innovativeness and merits of the method include: (1) reliable methodology, (2) construction using goal and zero systems, which serve as reference systems of sustainable agricultural development and allow control of the evaluation, and (3) index weights embedded in the evaluation function, which prevents errors or mistakes in the expert scoring method and prevents the reassignment of index weights due to adding or subtracting indicators. The main reasons that the SADE increased in ZYC include suitable chemical fertilization and pesticide application, enhancement of conservation farming areas, soil testing and fertilizer-formulated areas, and drinking water security in rural and non-disaster crop areas. The main problems with increasing the SADE in ZYC include straw application and low farmer income, both of which should be increased. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The reduction of food waste impacts positively all three dimensions of sustainability (economic, social, and environmental). Thirty-three challenges inhibiting reduction of waste in AFSC are identified by a review of the literature and a consultation with experts in the Indian food industry and academia. These challenges are grouped using Exploratory Factor Analysis into a super-set of nine challenges. The inter-relationship and respective dominance among these nine challenges is then determined using Interpretive Structural Modelling and MICMAC analysis. The group of independent challenges (food characteristics, supply chain uncertainty, market infrastructure, and food policy and regulation) have higher driving power and low dependency, and require maximum attention. These four challenges constrain decisions at the three-decision-making echelon (strategic, tactical, and operational) and each of the supply-chain echelons. The group of dependent challenges (supply chain partnerships, operational capability, and supply chain networks) have high dependence and low driving power and are resultant effects. The challenge, information technology, with high driving and dependence power, is a linkage variable. It acts as an enabler of dependent variables, and it mitigates the complexities due to food characteristics and uncertainty. The challenge, consumer behaviour, with low driving and dependence power, is an autonomous variable. It has little influence on waste reduction in Indian AFSC. This study highlights the importance of conducting region-specific study of supply chains and promotes sustainable practice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To ensure effective learning in such kind of serious games, designers are not only faced with the challenge of creating a compelling narrative, but also with the additional challenge of incorporating suitable pedagogical strategies. Therefore, development teams must consist of a multidisciplinary group including storytellers, technical staff and pedagogical experts to make sure that suitable pedagogical strategies are incorporated into the narrative. In this paper, the authors show how the Domain Specific Modeling Language ATTAC-L, for modeling the narrative of a serious game, allows creating the link between the processes of pedagogical design and narrative modeling by means of an elaborate annotation system. As such, this modeling language enables different experts to concentrate on the aspects related to their field of expertise without losing oversight of the serious game as a whole. More in particular, we will show how the annotation system can be used to document and integrate the use of a well-grounded pedagogical theory, Social Cognitive Theory, for achieving the goals of a serious game, as well as when the serious game is part of a program developed by means of a well-grounded design strategy, Intervention Mapping Protocol.;"[De Troyer, Olga; Van Broeckhoven, Frederik; Vlieghe, Joachim] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Comp Sci, Res Grp WISE, WISE 10F703,Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium";Van Broeckhoven, F (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Comp Sci, Res Grp WISE, WISE 10F703,Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.;"Olga.DeTroyer@vub.ac.be; Frederik.Van.Broeckhoven@vub.ac.be; Joachim.Vlieghe@vub.ac.be";;;IWT-SBOInstitute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT) [110051];This study was funded by IWT-SBO (Grant number 110051).;;59;4;4;0;14;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1042-1726;1867-1233;;J COMPUT HIGH EDUC;J.

Because tbo-filgrastim was less expensive than filgrastim, and clinical information and expert opinion supported similarity, the Pharmacy & Therapeutics Committee of a large health care system approved tbo-filgrastim as the preferred granulocyte- colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) product in March 2014. OBJECTIVES: To (a) assess the use of filgrastim and tbo-filgrastim products by comparing baseline characteristics, setting of care, indication for use, and payer type and (b) understand potential barriers of conversion to tbo-filgrastim. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of filgrastim and tbo-filgrastim use was conducted on all patients (N = 204) who received the drugs between July 2015 and December 2015 at the 2 largest hospitals in the health system. Baseline characteristics, indication requiring use of filgrastim or tbo-filgrastim, setting of care, and payer information were collected from electronic medical records, and descriptive analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Overall, G-CSFs were administered to 204 patients for 261 episodes of care (filgrastim and tbo-filgrastim were used in 65 and 196 episodes of care, respectively). Baseline characteristics were similar between the 59 patients who received filgrastim and the 174 patients who received tbo-filgrastim. G-CSF was primarily used in the inpatient setting (163 episodes of care, 63%) with 90% of patients using tbo-filgrastim. In the outpatient setting (98 episodes of care, 38%), filgrastim and tbo-filgrastim were each used by 50% of patients. Tbo-filgrastim was the preferred G-CSF by clinical providers for all indications, except for stem cell mobilization, where filgrastim use was higher (55% vs. 45% of 71 episodes of care). In the outpatient setting, analysis by payers showed that the majority of patients on commercial plans were using filgrastim (58%), while half of Medicare patients were using filgrastim (50%, n = 12). Twelve patients were self-paid, and all were using tbo-filgrastim. Subgroup analysis by hospital showed differences in utilization patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Although tbo-filgrastim was the preferred G-CSF in our formulary, 29% of patients continued to receive filgrastim. Conversion to tbo-filgrastim has been largely successful, but extra steps may be needed to achieve full conversion to biosimilars. Copyright (C) 2017, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

It only processes non-invasive electrohysterographic (EHG) signals fully automatically without assistance of an expert or an additional medical system. We used term and preterm EHG signals of 30-minutes duration collected between the 27th and the 32nd WG. Preterm deliveries (< 37WG) had occurred in average 4.00 +/- 1.88 weeks since recording dates. Each recording contains three bipolar channels. Using the Huang-Hilbert transform (HHT), we obtained up to twelve intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) for each signal. We found that the most relevant IMFs for both term and preterm records were IMF3 and IMF6. From these two IMFs, we extracted 8 most relevant features targeting EHG signal specificities. We investigated features classifications using support vector machine (SVM) for the 3 single-channels and for all their possible combinations. High discrimination power between term and preterm EHG records was obtained with linear-SVM classifiers. For almost all the cases, mean areas under curves (AUC) exceeded 0.92. A two-channel combination (7 features) achieved the best mean results with Accuracy = 95.70%, Sensitivity = 98.40%, Specificity = 93.00% and AUC = 0.95. Results of the three-channel combination (9 features) were Accuracy = 92.30%, Sensitivity = 93.00%, Specificity = 91.60% and AUC = 0.96. The best single-channel (8 features) gave the mean values: Accuracy = 90.40%, Sensitivity = 93.60% and AUC = 0.94. Thus, the advantage of our approach is the high diagnostic performance at low computational cost.;"[Sadi-Ahmed, Nafissa; Kacha, Baya; Taleb, Hamza; Kedir-Talha, Malika] USTHB, Fac Elect & Informat, PB 32 El Alia, Algiers 16111, Algeria";Sadi-Ahmed, N (corresponding author), USTHB, Fac Elect & Informat, PB 32 El Alia, Algiers 16111, Algeria.;n.sadiahmed@gmail.com;;;;;;37;9;9;2;10;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0148-5598;1573-689X;;J MED SYST;J.

The technical dimension is not enough to achieve this. Software development is a complex collaborative process where people and interpersonal relationships - i.e., how people interact, behave and organize - significantly influence the project success. In this paper, we define a framework to assign people to projects from this socio-technical perspective. Social networks characterizing the interplay between teammates are built and analyzed to predict productive collaborations and identify adequate team-members depending on the organization needs and the kind of project. A noteworthy novelty of these social networks is that they estimate compatibility between coworkers according to previous collaborations, but also according to individuals' social skills. This allows analyzing the compatibility among people who have not worked together before. We present results of using the proposed framework in a multinational corporation during a more-than-two-year period. Our in-company experiments emphasize that we can significantly improve the expected outcomes characterizing and measuring the social interaction among coworkers. Social aspects discussed may be highly relevant in the context of distributed software engineering, since it implies new challenges in the interplay among coworkers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TTM encompasses therapeutic hypothermia, controlled normothermia, and treatment of fever. TTM is best supported by evidence from neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, although it has also been explored in ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, and intracranial hemorrhage patients. Critical care clinicians using TTM must select appropriate cooling techniques, provide a reasonable rate of cooling, manage shivering, and ensure adequate patient monitoring among other challenges. The Neurocritical Care Society recruited experts in neurocritical care, nursing, and pharmacotherapy to form a writing Committee in 2015. The group generated a set of 16 clinical questions relevant to TTM using the PICO format. With the assistance of a research librarian, the Committee undertook a comprehensive literature search with no back date through November 2016 with additional references up to March 2017. The Committee utilized GRADE methodology to adjudicate the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low based on their confidence that the estimate of effect approximated the true effect. They generated recommendations regarding the implementation of TTM based on this systematic review only after considering the quality of evidence, relative risks and benefits, patient values and preferences, and resource allocation. This guideline is intended for neurocritical care clinicians who have chosen to use TTM in patient care; it is not meant to provide guidance regarding the clinical indications for TTM itself. While there are areas of TTM practice where clear evidence guides strong recommendations, many of the recommendations are conditional, and must be contextualized to individual patient and system needs.";"[Madden, Lori Kennedy] Univ Calif Davis, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Hill, Michelle] Riverside Methodist Hosp, Columbus, OH 43214 USA; [May, Teresa L.] Maine Med Ctr, Portland, ME 04102 USA; [Human, Theresa] Washington Univ, Barnes Jewish Hosp, St Louis, MO USA; [Guanci, Mary McKenna] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Jacobi, Judith] Indiana Univ, Hlth Methodist Hosp, Indianapolis, IN 46204 USA; [Moreda, Melissa V.] Duke Raleigh Hosp, Raleigh, NC USA; [Badjatia, Neeraj] Univ Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA";Madden, LK (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA.;lkmadden@ucdavis.edu;"Jacobi, Judith/ABE-2757-2020; Madden, Lori K/K-3749-2012";"Jacobi, Judith/0000-0003-2421-0734; Madden, Lori K/0000-0001-9179-4202";;;;205;29;36;2;8;HUMANA PRESS INC;TOTOWA;999 RIVERVIEW DRIVE SUITE 208, TOTOWA, NJ 07512 USA;1541-6933;1556-0961;;NEUROCRIT CARE;Neurocrit.

Usually laparoscopy is performed by means of a 2-dimensional (2D) image system and multiport approach. To overcome the lack of depth perception, new 3-dimensional (3D) systems are arising with the added advantage of providing stereoscopic vision. To further reduce surgery-related trauma, there are new minimally invasive surgical techniques being developed, such as LESS (laparoendoscopic single-site) surgery. The aim of this study was to compare 2D and 3D laparoscopic systems in LESS surgical procedures. Materials and Methods. All participants were selected from different levels of experience in laparoscopic surgery10 novices, 7 intermediates, and 10 experts were included. None of the participants had had previous experience in LESS surgery. Participants were chosen randomly to begin their experience with either the 2D or 3D laparoscopic system. The exercise consisted of performing an ex vivo pork cholecystectomy through a SILS port with the assistance of a fixed distance laparoscope. Errors, time, and participants' preference were recorded. Statistical analysis of time and errors between groups was conducted with a Student's t test (using independent samples) and the Mann-Whitney test. Results. In all 3 groups, the average time with the 2D system was significantly reduced after having used the 3D system (P < .05). In the postexercise questionnaire, two thirds of participants showed a preference for using the 3D system. Conclusion. This study suggests that the 3D system may improve the learning curve and that learning from the 3D system is transferable to the 2D environment. Additionally, the majority of participants prefer 3D equipment.;"[Vilaca, Jaime] Hosp Arrabida, Luz Saude, Portugal; [Pinto, Jose Pedro; Leao, Pedro] Hosp Braga, Braga, Portugal; [Vilaca, Jaime; Fernandes, Sandra; Costa, Patricio; Pinto, Jorge Correia; Leao, Pedro] Univ Minho, Braga, Portugal; [Costa, Patricio; Pinto, Jorge Correia; Leao, Pedro] ICVS 3Bs PT Govt Associate Lab, Braga, Portugal";Leao, P (corresponding author), Hosp Braga, Gen Surg, Apartado 2242, P-4701965 Braga, Portugal.;pedroleao@med.uminho.pt;"Costa, Patricio/A-3072-2013; Vilaca, Joao/M-6766-2013";"Costa, Patricio/0000-0002-1201-9177; Vilaca, Joao/0000-0002-4196-5357";;;;17;2;2;0;3;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;1553-3506;1553-3514;;SURG INNOV;Surg.

Monitoring of side effects and adverse effects may be subject to errors due to various factors such as the lack of privacy during data collection, shame on the part of the patient to talk about some issues, lack of recognition of symptoms and/or unawareness of side effects of treatments, and/or inappropriate reference model of data collection. In order to assist caregivers in proper data collection, a 'self-reporting questionnaire' was designed. The questionnaire was developed using validated scales such as the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale and Douleur Neuropathique en 4 Questions. The survey involved the population of patients scheduled for chemotherapy in Day Hospital at the Campus Bio-Medico University Hospital, Rome, between June and July 2015. During the period of observation, 367 patients were admitted to Day Hospital, 57.5% of women and 38.4% of men, average age 64 years, for a total of 622 accesses; of these, only 173 were interviewed by the nursing staff in relation to side effects and toxicity. During the trial, 381 patients were involved, of which 60.1% of women (p=0.8) and 38.3% of men (p=0.9), average age 63 years (p=0.9), for a total of 611 accesses and 498 self-reporting questionnaires administered. At the end of the trial period, in order to evaluate usability, an evaluation questionnaire was given to medical personnel, including five doctors and six nurses, to consider possible amendments to the instrument and its perceived effectiveness. Comparative analysis of data collected during the observation period and the trial showed how the use of the self-reporting questionnaire allowed for detection of side effects of chemotherapy earlier and in a more detailed way than relying only on medical examination and unstructured interview by nursing staff.

In conclusion, the use of self-reporting systems, together with the work and clinical judgment of the expert, can contribute to improvement in the patient quality of life, corroborating nurse interviews through a precise and systematic data collection process that reduces the amount of interpretation of symptoms by the patient and the caregiver, while providing them with precise instructions on what to report and how to report it.

It happens because their management background in managing the trade is still using network and kinship. Furthermore, lack of professionalism can be determined as the main weakness of groceries in facing AEC 2015, since 2015 ASEAN will be the only market that is supported by free goods, services, investments, capitals, and skilled worker. This condition is worsened by unhealthy competition between groceries and modern mini-market coupled with hypermart. In order to be able to compete with those stores, grocery needs to develop their system and managerial pattern. In other words, they need to develop their system from traditional into professional (equipped with legal aspect and utilizing modern technology). Changing direction from network and kinship into the professional system means that groceries need to be more focus on creating unique characteristics and professional competitiveness. It can be shown by changing lazy coupled with easy to give up attitude into high discipline and unyielding attitude. All efforts mentioned above need to be collected in a container in order to create synergy and compact advantage. The present study aims to identify competitiveness of Indonesian groceries in facing AEC. The present research uses expert analysis in form of Fuzzy Logic system which utilizes SWOT analysis in analyzing the competitiveness of Indonesian groceries in facing AEC. Internal issues coupled with external factors that are possessed by the groceries will be elaborated further in the present research. Expert analysis taken from Fuzzy Logic system is projected to help groceries in making strategic competitiveness decision to compete within AEC. Based on SWOT and cross tabulation analysis, it shows that implementation of information system concerning competitiveness of groceries has concrete relation toward efficiency of the business process and trading productivity since groceries are helped in making a decision and applying the system even those groceries do not have good managerial background.;"[Alimudin, Arasy; Soebandi] Narotama Univ Surabaya, Dept Management, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Falani, Achmad Zakki] Narotama Univ Surabaya, Dept Informat Engn, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Setiawan, Eman; Arifin, Bustomi] Narotama Univ Surabaya, Dept Educ, Surabaya, Indonesia";Alimudin, A (corresponding author), Narotama Univ Surabaya, Dept Management, Surabaya, Indonesia.;;Setiawan, Eman/AAB-6431-2021;"Setiawan, Eman/0000-0002-1238-8570; Alimudin, Arasy/0000-0003-0599-2136";;;;29;0;0;0;2;AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS;VALENCIA;26650 THE OLD RD, STE 208, VALENCIA, CA 91381-0751 USA;1936-6612;1936-7317;;ADV SCI LETT;Adv.

To better understand how and why IPE first took root, but failed to grow, this study examines one of the earliest documented IPE initiatives, which took place at the University of British Columbia between 1960 and 1975. We examined a subset of 110 texts (academic literature, grey literature, and unpublished records) from a larger study that uses Critical Discourse Analysis to trace the emergence of IPE in Canada. We asked how IPE was promoted and received, by whom, for what purposes, and to what effects. Our analysis demonstrates that IPE was promoted as a response to local challenges for the Faculty of Medicine as well as national challenges for Canada's emerging public healthcare system. These dual exigencies enabled the IPE initiative, but they shaped it in somewhat divergent ways: the former gave rise to its core component (a health sciences centre) and the latter its ultimate purpose (increasing the role of non-medical professions in primary care). Reception of the initiative was complicated by a further tension: nurses and allied health professionals were sometimes represented as independent experts with unique knowledge and skills, and sometimes as assistants or substitutes for medical doctors. We relate the successes and frustrations of this early initiative to particular (mis)alignments of purpose and relationships of power, some of which continue to enable and constrain IPE today.;"[Whyte, Sarah; Paradis, Elise; Cartmill, Carrie; Kuper, Ayelet; Whitehead, Cynthia R.] Univ Hlth Network, Wilson Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Whyte, Sarah] Univ Waterloo, Dept English Language & Literature, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Paradis, Elise; Boon, Heather] Univ Toronto, Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kuper, Ayelet] Sunnybrook Hlth Sci Ctr, Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Paradis, Elise; Kuper, Ayelet; Whitehead, Cynthia R.] Univ Toronto, Fac Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Hart, Corinne] Ryerson Univ, Daphne Cockwell Sch Nursing, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Razack, Saleem] McGill Univ, Fac Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Razack, Saleem] McGill Univ, Montreal Childrens Hosp, Pediat Crit Care Med, Hlth Sci Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Pipher, Mandy] Univ Toronto, Dept English, Toronto, ON, Canada";"Whitehead, CR (corresponding author), Univ Hlth Network, Wilson Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Whitehead, CR (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Fac Med, Toronto, ON, Canada.";cynthia.whitehead@utoronto.ca;;Paradis, Elise/0000-0001-9103-4721;Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP-126178];This work was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP-126178).

Given the clinical relevance of such injuries, especially in military settings, it is paramount to develop more accurate and reliable on-field evaluation tools. This work presents the design and implementation of the automated assessment of postural stability (AAPS) system, for on-field evaluations following concussion. The AAPS is a computer system, based on inexpensive off-the-shelf components and custom software, that aims to automatically and reliably evaluate balance deficits, by replicating a known on-field clinical test, namely, the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS). The AAPS main innovation is its balance error detection algorithm that has been designed to acquire data from a Microsoft Kinect(A (R)) sensor and convert them into clinically-relevant BESS scores, using the same detection criteria defined by the original BESS test. In order to assess the AAPS balance evaluation capability, a total of 15 healthy subjects (7 male, 8 female) were required to perform the BESS test, while simultaneously being tracked by a Kinect 2.0 sensor and a professional-grade motion capture system (Qualisys AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). High definition videos with BESS trials were scored off-line by three experienced observers for reference scores. AAPS performance was assessed by comparing the AAPS automated scores to those derived by three experienced observers. Our results show that the AAPS error detection algorithm presented here can accurately and precisely detect balance deficits with performance levels that are comparable to those of experienced medical personnel. Specifically, agreement levels between the AAPS algorithm and the human average BESS scores ranging between 87.9% (single-leg on foam) and 99.8% (double-leg on firm ground) were detected. Moreover, statistically significant differences in balance scores were not detected by an ANOVA test with alpha equal to 0.05. Despite some level of disagreement between human and AAPS-generated scores, the use of an automated system yields important advantages over currently available human-based alternatives. These results underscore the value of using the AAPS, that can be quickly deployed in the field and/or in outdoor settings with minimal set-up time. Finally, the AAPS can record multiple error types and their time course with extremely high temporal resolution. These features are not achievable by humans, who cannot keep track of multiple balance errors with such a high resolution. Together, these results suggest that computerized BESS calculation may provide more accurate and consistent measures of balance than those derived from human experts.;"[Napoli, Alessandro; Tucker, Carole; Obeid, Iyad] Temple Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Glass, Stephen M.; Tucker, Carole] Temple Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Philadelphia, PA 19140 USA";Napoli, A (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.;a.napoli@temple.edu;;"Obeid, Iyad/0000-0002-5796-843X; Napoli, Alessandro/0000-0002-4061-3747; Glass, Stephen/0000-0001-6263-527X";Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs through the Neurosensory and Rehabilitation Research Award Program [W81XWH-15-1-0045];This work was supported by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs through the Neurosensory and Rehabilitation Research Award Program under Award No. W81XWH-15-1-0045.

The purpose of this study is to assist potential developers in selecting the most suitable cuckoo search variant, provide proper guidance in future modifications and ease the selection of the optimal cuckoo search parameters. Several researchers have attempted to apply several modifications to the original cuckoo search algorithm in order to advance its effectiveness. This paper reviews the recent advances of these modifications made to the original cuckoo search by analyzing recent published papers tackling this subject. Additionally, the influences of various parameter settings regarding cuckoo search are taken into account in order to provide their optimal settings for specific problem classes. In order to estimate the qualities of the modifications, the percentage improvements made by the modified cuckoo search over the original cuckoo search for some selected reviews studies are computed. It is found that the population reduction and usage of biased random walk are the most frequently used modifications. This study can be used by both expert and novice researchers for outlining directions for future development, and to find the best modifications, together with the corresponding optimal setting of parameters for specific problems. The review can also serve as a benchmark for further modifications of the original cuckoo search. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, by considering all these degrees, some aggregation operators, namely picture fuzzy weighted average, picture fuzzy ordered weighted average, and picture fuzzy hybrid average aggregation operators, have been proposed along with their desirable properties. A decision-making approach based on these operators has also been presented.

Nevertheless, a large multicenter evaluation of the inter-observer reading variability in this field is still missing. This work fills this gap as we evaluated 556 consecutive samples, for a total of 1679 images, collected in three laboratories with IIF expertise using HEp-2 cell substrate (MBL) at 1:80 screening dilution according to conventional procedures. In each laboratory, the images were blindly classified by two experts into three intensity classes: positive, negative, and weak positive. Positive and weak positive ANA-IIF results were categorized by the predominant fluorescence pattern among six main classes. Data were pairwise analyzed and the inter-observer reading variability was measured by Cohen's kappa test, revealing a pairwise agreement little further away than substantial both for fluorescence intensity and for staining pattern recognition (k = 0.602 and k = 0.627, respectively). We also noticed that the inter-observer reading variability decreases when it is measured with respect to a gold standard classification computed on the basis of labels assigned by the three laboratories. These data show that laboratory agreement improves using digital images and comparing each single human evaluation to potential reference data, suggesting that a solid gold standard is essential to properly make use of CAD systems in routine work lab.

The procedure involves judging the suitability, capability and competency of the contractor on various criteria, using both anecdotal and empirical evidence. The evidence used is often imprecise and subjective, and so is the evaluation and decision making procedure. Type-1 fuzzy sets have been used in the prequalification procedure to handle uncertain information. However, type-1 fuzzy sets are unable to reflect the differences in opinion among experts involved in group decision making. The purpose of this paper is to propose a practical prequalification procedure that uses interval type-2 fuzzy sets to address both linguistic imprecision and differences of opinion. A numerical example shows how the proposed procedure is carried out and the benefits that result compared to a similar procedure using type-1 fuzzy sets.;"[Afshar, Mohammad Reza; Alipouri, Yagub; Sebt, Mohammad Hassan] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Chan, Weng Tat] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Civil Engn, Singapore 119260, Singapore";Chan, WT (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Civil Engn, Singapore 119260, Singapore.;"m.afshar67@aut.ac.ir; yalipouri@aut.ac.ir; sebt@aut.ac.ir; ceecwt@nus.edu.sg";"Sebt, Mohammad Hassan/M-3131-2018; Alipouri, Yaghoub/AAS-4965-2020";"Sebt, Mohammad Hassan/0000-0002-5276-1827; Alipouri, Yaghoub/0000-0002-4934-5435; Chan, Weng Tat/0000-0001-7012-9115";;;;28;15;15;2;31;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0926-5805;1872-7891;;AUTOMAT CONSTR;Autom.

We report the results of outcomes after 2years of observational follow-up of adult patients assessed within the network. MethodA total of 984 patients were included in the study. We compared several parameters (e.g., mood episodes and hospitalization) 1year before inclusion and after 2 years of observational follow-up using the patient as his or her own control. Other outcomes were compared at baseline and during follow-up. We estimated the evolution of these parameters over a period of 2years using mixed models for continuous parameters and a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model for categorical variables, adjusting for potential confounding factors. ResultsMean age was 42.7(12.5) years and 58.8% were women. The number of hospitalization days decreased by 55% when comparing 1year before inclusion vs the follow-up period. In addition, patients showed a clear functional improvement associated with a reduction of residual mood symptoms, diminished psychiatric comorbidities, improvement of sleep and a better adherence to treatment. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates an overall improvement of patients followed for 2years after an assessment in expert centers for bipolar disorders. This new organization based on a thorough clinical assessment and on personalized recommendations (drug treatments, psycho-social strategies and lifestyle measures) sent to health care professionals, and actively involving patients and families, improves the prognosis of BD patients.;"[Henry, Chantal; Leboyer, Marion] INSERM, U955, Equipe Psychiat Translat 15, Creteil, France; [Henry, Chantal; Leboyer, Marion] Univ Paris Est Creteil Val de Marne, Creteil, France; [Henry, Chantal; Godin, Ophelia; Courtet, Philippe; Azorin, Jean-Michel; Gard, Sebastien; Bellivier, Frank; Polosan, Mircea; Kahn, Jean-Pierre; Roux, Paul; Aubin, Valerie; Leboyer, Marion; Etain, Bruno] Fdn FondaMental, Fdn Cooperat Sci, Creteil, France; [Henry, Chantal; Leboyer, Marion] Hop H Mondor A Chenevier, AP HP, DHU PePSY, Pole Psychiat, Creteil, France; [Henry, Chantal] Inst Pasteur, Unite Percept & Memoire, Paris, France; [Godin, Ophelia; Costagliola, Dominique] Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Inst Pierre Louis Epidemiol & Sante Publ, IPLESP UMRS 1136, Paris, France; [Godin, Ophelia; Costagliola, Dominique] INSERM, UMR S 1136, Paris, France; [Courtet, Philippe] CHU, Dept Urgence & Post Urgence Psychiat, Montpellier, France; [Courtet, Philippe] Univ Montpellier, INSERM, U1061, Montpellier, France; [Azorin, Jean-Michel] Hop St Marguerite, Dept Psychiat, Marseille 9, France; [Gard, Sebastien] Ctr Hosp Charles Perrens, Pole Psychiat Gen Univ, Ctr Expert Bipolaire, Bordeaux, France; [Bellivier, Frank; Etain, Bruno] Univ Paris Diderot, Dept Psychiat Med Addictol, Paris, France; [Bellivier, Frank; Etain, Bruno] GH St Louis Lariboisiere Fernand Widal, AP HP, Paris, France; [Polosan, Mircea] Univ Joseph Fourier Grenoble I, Grenoble, France; [Polosan, Mircea] CHU Grenoble, Grenoble, France; [Polosan, Mircea] INSERM, U836, GIN, La Tronche, France; [Kahn, Jean-Pierre] Univ Lorraine, CHU Nancy, Laxou, France; [Kahn, Jean-Pierre] Ctr Psychotherap Nancy, Pole Psychiat & Psychol Clin 6, Laxou, France; [Roux, Paul] Ctr Hosp Versailles, Le Chesnay, France; [Roux, Paul] Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, Versailles, France; [Aubin, Valerie] Ctr Hosp Princesse Grace, Dept Psychatrie, Monaco, Monaco";Henry, C (corresponding author), Hop Univ Henri Mondor, Hop A Chenevier, Pole Psychiat & Addictol, Creteil, France.;chantal.henry@inserm.fr;"Costagliola, Dominique/H-5849-2011; Etain, Bruno/L-6647-2017";"Costagliola, Dominique/0000-0003-0765-0869; Etain, Bruno/0000-0002-5377-1488; Roux, Paul/0000-0003-0321-4189; LEBOYER, Marion/0000-0001-5473-3697; Cohen, Renaud Francois/0000-0001-6900-7786";FondaMental Foundation;FondaMental Foundation;;34;8;8;0;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1398-5647;1399-5618;;BIPOLAR DISORD;Bipolar Disord.;DEC;2017;19;8;;;;;651;660;;10.1111/bdi.12539;;;10;"Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences; Psychiatry";"Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry";FQ5SO;WOS:000418421500004;28944553;;;;2021-02-18;

Secondary objectives were to assess IAH as a predictor of morbidity and mortality in the ICU. Methods: This prospective international observational study included patients admitted to the ICU with AP and at least one organ failure. Information was collected on demographics, severity scores at admission using RAC and DBC, organ failure, mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), surgery and mortality. Maximum intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) during ICU stay was used for analysis. Results: Some 374 patients were included. The hospital mortality rate was 28.9 per cent. IAP was measured in 301 patients (80.5 per cent), of whom 274 (91.0 per cent) had IAH and 103 (34.2 per cent) acute compartment syndrome. A higher IAH grade was more likely in patients with severe AP (42 per cent for grade I versus 84 per cent for grade IV) and acute critical pancreatitis (9 versus 25 per cent; P = 0.001). Compared with grade I IAH, patients with grade IV had more infected necrosis (16 versus 28 per cent; P = 0.005), need for surgery (27 versus 50 per cent; P = 0.006), mechanical ventilation (53 versus 84 per cent; P = 0.007) and requirement for CRRT (22 versus 66 per cent; P < 0.001). IAH predicted shock (area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) 0.79, 95 per cent c.i. 0.73 to 0.84), respiratory failure (AUC 0.82, 0.77 to 0.87), renal failure (AUC 0.93, 0.89 to 0.96) and mortality (AUC 0.89, 0.86 to 0.93). Conclusion: IAH was associated with severity of AP classified according to both RAC and DBC systems.

This evidence- based practice guideline for ITP enables the appropriate treatment of a larger proportion of patients and the maintenance of normal platelet counts. Korean authority operates a unified mandatory national health insurance system. Even though we have a uniform standard guideline enforced by insurance reimbursement, there are several unsolved issues in real practice in ITP treatment. To optimize the management of Korean ITP patients, the Korean Society of Hematology Aplastic Anemia Working Party (KSHAAWP) reviewed the consensus and the Korean data on the clinical practices of ITP therapy.

Design and methods This was a consensus-building process among the members of a multistakeholder task force, involving a wide range of experts (researchers, patient representatives, methodologists, information technology experts, and representatives from funders, infrastructures and standards development organisations). An independent facilitator supported the process using the nominal group technique. The consensus was reached in a series of three workshops held over 1 year, supported by exchange of documents and teleconferences within focused subgroups when needed. This work was set within the Horizon 2020-funded project CORBEL (Coordinated Research Infrastructures Building Enduring Life-science Services) and coordinated by the European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network. Thus, the focus was on non-commercial trials and the perspective mainly European. Outcome We developed principles and practical recommendations on how to share data from clinical trials. Results The task force reached consensus on 10 principles and 50 recommendations, representing the fundamental requirements of any framework used for the sharing of clinical trials data. The document covers the following main areas: making data sharing a reality (eg, cultural change, academic incentives, funding), consent for data sharing, protection of trial participants (eg, de-identification), data standards, rights, types and management of access (eg, data request and access models), data management and repositories, discoverability, and metadata. Conclusions The adoption of the recommendations in this document would help to promote and support data sharing and reuse among researchers, adequately inform trial participants and protect their rights, and provide effective and efficient systems for preparing, storing and accessing data. The recommendations now need to be implemented and tested in practice. Further work needs to be done to integrate these proposals with those from other geographical areas and other academic domains.;"[Ohmann, Christian] ECRIN, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Banzi, Rita; Clivio, Luca] IRFMN, IRCCS, Milan, Italy; [Canham, Steve] Canham Informat Syst, Surrey, England; [Battaglia, Serena; Matei, Mihaela; Kubiak, Christine; Demotes-Mainard, Jacques] ECRIN, Paris, France; [Ariyo, Christopher; Lukkarinen, Ari] CSC IT Ctr Sci, Espoo, Finland; [Becnel, Lauren; Houston, Paul; van Reusel, Peter] Clin Data Interchange Stand Consortium, Austin, TX USA; [Bierer, Barbara] Brigham & Womens Hosp, MRCT Ctr BWH & Harvard, Boston, MA USA; [Bierer, Barbara] Harvard Univ, Boston, MA USA; [Bowers, Sarion; Wilson, Julia] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge, England; [Dias, Monica] European Med Agcy, London, England; [Druml, Christiane] Med Univ Vienna, Eth Collect & Hist Med, Vienna, Austria; [Faure, Helene; Shanahan, Daniel] BioMed Cent, London, England; [Fenner, Martin] DataCite, Hannover, NH, Germany; [Galvez, Jose] NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Ghersi, Davina] Natl Hlth & Med Res Council, Watson, ACT, Australia; [Gluud, Christian] Rigshosp, Copenhagen Univ Hosp, Ctr Clin Intervent Res, Copenhagen Trial Unit, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Groves, Trish] BMJ Editorial, BMJ Editorial BMA House, London, England; [Karam, Ghassan] WHO, Org Mondiale Sante, Geneva, Switzerland; [Kalra, Dipak] European Inst Innovat Hlth Data, Ghent, Belgium; [Knowles, Rachel L.] MRC, London, England; [Krleza-Jeric, Karmela] IMPACT, Ottawa Grp, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Kuchinke, Wolfgang] Heinrich Heine Univ, Coordinat Ctr Clin Trials, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Kush, Rebecca] Formerly Clin Data Interchange Stand Consortium, Austin, TX USA; [Marques, Pedro Silverio] EATG, Lisbon, Portugal; [Newbigging, Andrew] TrialGrid Ltd, London, England; [Newbigging, Andrew] Formerly Medidata Solut, Hammersmith, England; [O'Callaghan, Jennifer] Wellcome Trust Res Labs, London, England; [Ravaud, Philippe] INSERM, METHODS Team, UMR S 1153, Paris, France; [Schluender, Irene] Biobanking & Biomol Resources Res Infrastruct BBM, Berlin, Germany; [Shanahan, Daniel] Fac 1000, London, England; [Sitter, Helmut] Philipps Univ, Inst Theoret Surg, Marburg, Germany; [Spalding, Dylan] EBI, EMBL, Hinxton, England; [Tudur-Smith, Catrin] Univ Liverpool, Dept Biostat, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [van Veen, Evert-Ben] MLC Fdn, The Hague, Netherlands; [van Veen, Evert-Ben] Medlawconsult, The Hague, Netherlands; [Visser, Gerben Rienk] Trial Data Solut, Amsterdam, Netherlands";Ohmann, C (corresponding author), ECRIN, Dusseldorf, Germany.;Christian.Ohmann@uni-duesseldorf.de;"ravaud, philippe/C-1694-2009; Ohmann, Christian/AAV-8608-2020; Banzi, Rita/AAA-6381-2020; Knowles, Rachel/L-3236-2018; Krleza-Jeric, Karmela/M-5253-2018; Groves, Trish/A-9119-2009";"Banzi, Rita/0000-0002-2211-3300; Knowles, Rachel/0000-0002-5490-7682; Ravaud, Philippe/0000-0001-8264-9206; Gluud, Christian/0000-0002-8861-0799; Kalra, Dinesh/0000-0001-5254-4067; Krleza-Jeric, Karmela/0000-0001-9377-0917; Groves, Trish/0000-0001-7915-6419; Shanahan, Daniel/0000-0002-6588-7947; Spalding, John Dylan/0000-0002-4285-2493; houston, paul/0000-0002-0612-5344";"European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [654248]; Medical Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/L004933/1, MR/K025635/1, MR/L004933/2] Funding Source: researchfish";This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (CORBEL, under grant agreement no 654248).;;61;43;43;1;10;BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP;LONDON;BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND;2044-6055;;;BMJ OPEN;BMJ Open;DEC;2017;7;12;;;;;;;e018647;10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018647;;;24;Medicine, General & Internal;General & Internal Medicine;FU4MH;WOS:000423826700163;29247106;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-02-18;

The Emergency First Aid Responder (EFAR) programme is short course originally developed to help South Africans manage emergencies at the community level, pending arrival of formal care providers. EFAR was implemented in two rural regions of Zambia in 2015, but no changes were originally made to tailor the course to the new setting. We undertook this study to identify potential refinements in the original EFAR curriculum, and to adapt it to the local context in Zambia. Design The EFAR curriculum was mapped against available chief complaint data. An expert group used information from the map, in tandem with personal knowledge, to rank each course topic for potential impact on patient outcomes and frequency of use in practice. Individual blueprints were compiled to generate a refined EFAR curriculum, the time breakdown of which reflects the relative weight of each topic. Setting This study was conducted based on data collected in Kasama, a rural region of Zambia's Northern Province. Participants An expert group of five physicians practising emergency medicine was selected; all reviewers have expertise in the Zambian context, EFAR programme and/or curriculum development. Results The range of emergencies that Zambian EFARs encounter indicates that the course must be broad in scope. The refined curriculum covers 54 topics (seven new) and 25 practical skills (five new).

Although TEG is recyclable, it is usually lost in the system due to vaporization and carryover, which results in economic issues. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the dehydration process to achieve the allowable water concentration in the gas, to minimize the use of energy, and to minimize the loss of TEG. Experimental set was designed using Design Expert software by utilising data from Farashband gas processing plant, Iran and subsequently, fed to ASPEN HYSYS to construct and simulate the dehydration process. The chosen affecting parameters to the process were the (1) lean glycol circulation rate, (2) the temperature of the reboiler, and (3) the number of trays in the contactor column. Whereas, the response parameters included the (1) amount of glycol that was lost, (2) the reboiler duty, (3) the concentration of water in the dry gas, and the (4) temperature at which the hydrate formed. Then, these data were optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM). The results indicated that the optimum conditions within the experimental range conducted in this study of process parameters chosen, of the lean glycol circulation rate, the temperature of the reboiler, and the number of trays in the glycol contactor column for the gas dehydration process for the plant were 3944 kg/hr, 180 degrees C, and three trays, respectively.;"[Kamin, Zykamilia; Bono, Awang; Leong, Lek Yan] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Engn, Jalan UMS, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Sabah, Malaysia";Kamin, Z (corresponding author), Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Engn, Jalan UMS, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Sabah, Malaysia.;zykamilia@ums.edu.my;;;;;;18;3;3;1;22;WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH;BERLIN;GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY;1934-2659;2194-6159;;CHEM PROD PROCESS MO;Chem.

Recently, with the development of medical engineering technology, several evaluation methods have been proposed. Among them, kinematic analysis, an unsupervised and data-based method, has been accepted by many researchers. However, this method is still limited by the number of metrics and unconvinced scoring system. This paper aims to propose a new evaluation method to assess surgical skills efficiently and objectively. Methods: this research proposed an efficient and effective surgical skills evaluation algorithm which used the trajectories of instrument tip and dynamic time warping (DTW) to provide trainees with real-time and summative feedback. The optimum trajectories based on 'Therbligs' theory was designed as a template. DTW algorithm was used to align actual trajectories to optimum trajectories with an evaluating indicator designed to emphasize the crucial motion features in surgical skills evaluation. The real-time feedback was obtained through a sliding time window to help trainees improve learning efficiency. Results: experts (n = 2) and novices (n = 8) were invited to complete the peg transfer tasks and 60 instrument tip trajectories were assessed by the proposed algorithm. Significant differences between different groups were observed (experts' right trajectories versus experts' left trajectories, p = 0.0002; experts' right trajectories versus novices' right trajectories, p = 0.0124). In addition, evaluation results of trajectories with operational mistakes were significantly different from those of others. Conclusions: the proposed evaluation method showed its advantages in distinguishing and evaluating surgical performance. Given its ability to evaluate the performance based on kinematic information, the proposed evaluation method can be further developed in the future. Furthermore, because the proposed method can provide real-time feedback, it also has the potential to be a monitoring system in operation room. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Direct Digital Manufacturing (DDM) using 3D Printers can change how geoscientists, students, and stakeholders interact with 3D data, with the potential to improve geoscience communication and environmental literacy. No other manufacturing technology can convert digital data into tangible objects quickly at relatively low cost; however, the expertise necessary to produce a 3D-printed terrain model can be a substantial burden: knowledge of geographical information systems, computer aided design (CAD) software, and 3D printers may all be required. Furthermore, printing models larger than the build volume of a 3D printer can pose further technical hurdles. The TouchTerrain web-application simplifies DDM for elevation data by generating digital 3D models customized for a specific 3D printer's capabilities. The only required user input is the selection of a region-of-interest using the provided web-application with a Google Maps-style interface. Publically available digital elevation data is processed via the Google Earth Engine API. To allow the manufacture of 3D terrain models larger than a 3D printer's build volume the selected area can be split into multiple tiles without third-party software. This application significantly reduces the time and effort required for a non-expert like an educator to obtain 3D terrain models for use in class.

One recent innovation is Twitch (TM), an online streaming platform often used for video game tutorials but also enables amateur online instruction (Hamilton, Garretson, & Kerne, 2014)). Twitch represents a unique learning paradigm that is not perfectly represented in previous technologies because of its ground-up evolution and the opportunity for novice instructors to educate mass audiences in real-time over the Internet while enabling interaction between teachers and learners and among learners. The purpose of this research is to empirically examine the efficacy of Twitch as a learning platform by manipulating each of the key characteristics of Twitch and to understand the conditions in which novice instructors may be beneficial. Drawing from Cognitive Load Theory, we demonstrate the worked-example effect in the Twitch environment by manipulating teacher-learner-learner interactions, live versus recorded streaming, and expert-versus novice-based instruction. Based on a laboratory experiment involving 350 participants, we found that learning performance under novice instructors was at least as good as that of experts. However, an exploratory analysis of learner personalities revealed that extroverts benefit only when learner-learner interaction is enabled. Surprisingly, those who are highly agreeable and less neurotic benefited more from novice instructors. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The importance of earthquakes in Tehran and the high vulnerability of the University of Tehran to earthquakes encouraged us to challenge the university's plans concerning disaster management. Methods: An initial attempt was made to analyze the disaster management of 23 renowned universities worldwide and their structure compared with the present organizational structure of the University of Tehran. Then an expert opinion study was done to determine the appropriate management structure of the Incident Command System. Results: These efforts resulted in an adhocratic system as the proper one for emergency situations after an earthquake. Furthermore, the results of the comparative study led to a general management structure that may be considered as a global pattern.

Moreover, since a large number of the activities of megacities' municipalities have directly to do with HSE issues, there seems to be a substantial gap in the study of megacities and corresponding local public administrations. The present study is aimed at developing a performance evaluation tool, supported by indicators, to monitor the HSE aspects of sustainable development in the municipalities of megacities. To put the proposed tool into practice, a set of performance evaluation indicators is proposed to be adopted in Iranian municipalities, integrated in the megacity of Tehran. The selection process was conducted by employing Delphi technique. In doing so, a 2-round questionnaire was responded by qualified experts to select the most robust indicators of HSE performance and evaluate the priority of each indicator. A total of 80 indicators were generated and grouped into 13 categories, 29 sub-categories, and 7 themes- (Health (H), Safety (S), Environment (E), Health-Safety (HS), Health-Environment (HE), Safety-Environment (SE), and Health, Safety and Environment (HSE)). Findings indicate that amongst the overall average score of the 13 categories, Fire and emergency response is the most important category, closely followed by Waste, Transportation, and Natural systems categories. Moreover, among the 7 proposed themes, the integrated HSE theme, nearly followed by safety theme, plays the most significant role in enhancing the HSE performance of sustainability in Tehran municipalities. It is concluded that in the HSE context of the megacities municipalities under scrutiny, social aspects of sustainability gain more attention in comparison with the environmental ones. Furthermore, in municipalities of megacities, the indicators related to health and safety could be considered as 'key indicators' and should be thus classified into independent categories so that their roles can be highlighted in the management and assessment of municipal sustainable development.;"[Mapar, Mahsa; Jafari, Mohammad Javad; Mansouri, Nabiollah; Arjmandi, Reza] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Environm Management, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Jafari, Mohammad Javad] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Tehran, Iran; [Azizinejad, Reza] Islamic Azad Univ, Fac Agr & Nat Resources, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Plant Breeding, Tehran, Iran; [Ramos, Tomas B.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Dept Ciencias & Engn Ambiente, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, CENSE,Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res, Campus Caparica, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal";Jafari, MJ (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Environm Management, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran.;"mapar.hse@gmail.com; jafari1952@yahoo.com; nmansourin@gmail.com; hrezaarjmandi@gmail.com; r.azizi@srbiau.ac.ir; tabr@fct.unl.pt";"Mansouri, Nabiollah/AAZ-6795-2020; Ramos, Tomas B./E-7152-2013";"Mansouri, Nabiollah/0000-0002-4228-6444; Ramos, Tomas B./0000-0002-8270-4022; Mapar, Mahsa/0000-0001-8294-5224";"Tehran Urban Research and Planning Centre [137.958879]; Islamic Azad University's Faculty of Environment and Energy, Science and Research Branch; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, PortugalPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [Pest-OE/AMB/UI4085/2013]";This project was supported by Tehran Urban Research and Planning Centre (137.958879) and the Islamic Azad University's Faculty of Environment and Energy, Science and Research Branch, as a co-benefit project.

However, simulation models have limited relevance to real-world applications when designed without input from people who could use the simulated scenarios to inform their decisions. Here, we report on a state-and-transition simulation model of vegetation dynamics that was coupled to a scenario planning process and co-produced by researchers, resource managers, local subject-matter experts, and climate change adaptation specialists to explore potential effects of climate scenarios and management alternatives on key resources in southwest South Dakota. Input from management partners and local experts was critical for representing key vegetation types, bison and cattle grazing, exotic plants, fire, and the effects of climate change and management on rangeland productivity and composition given the paucity of published data on many of these topics. By simulating multiple land management jurisdictions, climate scenarios, and management alternatives, the model highlighted important tradeoffs between grazer density and vegetation composition, as well as between the short-and long-term costs of invasive species management. It also pointed to impactful uncertainties related to the effects of fire and grazing on vegetation. More broadly, a scenario-based approach to model co-production bracketed the uncertainty associated with climate change and ensured that the most important (and impactful) uncertainties related to resource management were addressed. This cooperative study demonstrates six opportunities for scientists to engage users throughout the modeling process to improve model utility and relevance: (1) identifying focal dynamics and variables, (2) developing conceptual model(s), (3) parameterizing the simulation, (4) identifying relevant climate scenarios and management alternatives, (5) evaluating and refining the simulation, and (6) interpreting the results.

The regulation allows the Commission to amend Annex I, listing additional stunning interventions, provided they ensure a level of animal welare at least equivalent to that ensured by the one already approved. EFSA was requested to perform such assessment with regard to the implementation of the low atmospheric pressure stunning (LAPS) system on broiler chickens. The ad hoc Working Group (WG) set up by EFSA performed the assessment in three main steps, i.e. checking the data provided against the criteria laid down in the EFSA Guidance (EFSA AHAW Panel, 2013); running an extensive literature search, followed by data extraction and performing a judgemental ranking exercise based on expert opinion. As main outcome, the LAPS intervention was found to be able to provide a level of animal welfare not lower than that provided by at least one of the currently allowed methods. The overall assessment of EFSA is valid ONLY under the technical conditions described in the submission and for broiler chickens, intended for human consumption, weighting less than 4 kg. Deviations from these conditions might have different consequences for animal welfare which were not assessed in this exercise. The LAPS method may, in addition to commercial slaughter, be suitable for depopulation, respecting the technical conditions defined in the present conclusions.

Therefore, only medical officers are authorised to examine the human body because of their competency. As medical doctors, forensic medicine specialists certainly bind to medical ethics. However, there are lots of conflicts between ought and must while applying these principles of medical ethics in Indonesian legal system. This paper will discuss the ethico-legal conflicts in investigation phase, which are usually related to medico-legal autopsy. Then, the ethico-legal conflicts in trial phase, which are frequently associated with giving evidence as an expert witness before the court, will be addressed.;[Henky, Henky] Udayana Univ, Med Sch, Sanglah Hosp, Dept Forens Med, Diponegoro St, Denpasar 80113, Bali, Indonesia;Henky, H (corresponding author), Udayana Univ, Med Sch, Sanglah Hosp, Dept Forens Med, Diponegoro St, Denpasar 80113, Bali, Indonesia.;henky@unud.ac.id;;;;;;9;0;0;0;0;INT ASSOC LAW & FORENSIC SCIENCES;CAIRO;1 AWAL MAYO BLDG, EL-NASR RD, CAIRO, 11371, EGYPT;2090-536X;2090-5939;;EGYPT J FORENSIC SCI;Egypt.

Such control is possible through fuzzy mathematics, which is a meta-collection of Boolean logic principles that imply relative accuracy. Fuzzy mathematics find applications in e-commerce, where different risk analysis methods are available for risk assessment and estimation. Such approaches can be quantitative or qualitative, depending on the type of examined data. Quantitative methods are grounded in statistics, whereas qualitative methods are based on expert judgments and fuzzy set theory. Given that qualitative methods are very subjective and deal with vague or inaccurate data, fuzzy logic can be used to extract useful information from data inaccuracies. In this study, a model based on the opinions of e-commerce security experts was designed and implemented by using fuzzy expert systems and MATLAB. A case study was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the Model.;"[Beheshti, Haniyeh] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Engn, E Campus, Tehran, Iran; [Alborzi, Mahmood] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Management & Informat Technol, Tehran, Iran";Beheshti, H (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Engn, E Campus, Tehran, Iran.;"Haniyeh.beheshti@yahoo.com; mahmood_alborzi@yahoo.com";;;;;;14;1;1;0;2;EOS ASSOC;GASTOUNI;ARCHAIAS ILIDAS 16, GASTOUNI, 27050, GREECE;2241-4487;1792-8036;;ENG TECHNOL APPL SCI;Eng.

An opinion from the French Association for Disaster Risk Reduction;ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Climate change; Climate governance; Expertise; IPCC; Science and policy";"CLIMATE-CHANGE; INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL; SCIENCE; UNCERTAINTY; HISTORY; POLICY; KNOWLEDGE; CONSENSUS; POLITICS; IMPACT";The levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere keep increasing every year, and despite the adoption of the Paris agreement, one cannot expect any significant dip in the trend in the near future. We may therefore legitimately question the efficiency of the current governance system, notably concerning the interplay between science and policy. The strategy adopted by the UNFCCC in Paris contrasts with the strategy adopted in Kyoto, as it endorses a dynamic that is more bottom-up. Its success will depend greatly on the ability of the actors to mobilise on climate issues and to find ways to work together. Scientific expertise has a key role to play to this respect. This paper is a reflection led by the French Association for Disaster Risk Reduction on how the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change could evolve in order to usefully accompany that strategy. Introducing more reflexivity in the assessment process and widening aspects of the expertise to a more diverse and transdisciplinary range of actors could improve the treatment of uncertainties, multi-scale interactions and the appropriation of expertise, as well as the integration of adaptation and mitigation policies. In practical terms, this could involve more working groups, which could become more focused, drawing up shorter but more frequent reports, and taking account of the grey expert literature. The implementation of such an approach merits further investigation, because these improvements could help address the governance challenges in climate change.;"[Deves, Maud H.] CNRS, Inst Phys Globe Paris, UMR 7154, Paris, France; [Deves, Maud H.] Univ Paris Diderot, Ctr Rech Psychanal Med & Soc, CNRS EA 3522, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; [Lang, Michel] IRSTEA, Ctr Lyon Villeurbanne, Unite Rech Hydrol Hydraul, Villeurbanne, France; [Valerian, Francois] Conseil Gen Econ, CNAM, LabEx ReFi, Villeurbanne, France; [Deves, Maud H.; Lang, Michel; Bourrelier, Paul-Henri; Valerian, Francois] AFPCN, Sci Comm, Paris, France";Deves, MH (corresponding author), Inst Phys Globe Paris, 1 Rue Jussieu, F-75238 Paris 05, France.;deves@ipgp.fr;Deves, Maud H./M-1250-2019;"Deves, Maud H./0000-0002-9063-4503; LANG, Michel/0000-0003-1417-1495";"COMUE Sorbonne Paris Cite; COMUE Sorbonne Paris Cite";"The authors want to thank their anonymous reviewers for very helpful comments in dealing with the first version of the manuscript.

Testosterone is a sex hormone that is predominant in males but also occurs in lower concentrations in females. It has effects directly on the blood vessels of the cardiovascular system and on the heart, as well as effects on risk factors for CVD. Serum testosterone concentrations are known to decrease with age and reduced testosterone levels are linked to premature coronary artery disease, unfavourable effects on CVD risk factors and increased risk of cardiovascular mortality independent of age. A significant number of men with heart failure demonstrate reduced serum testosterone concentrations and there is early evidence suggesting that low testosterone levels affect cardiac repolarisation. Any association between endogenous testosterone concentrations and CVD in women has yet to be established. Testosterone replacement is used to treat men with hypogonadism but also has cardiovascular effects. This review will present the current evidence, expert opinion and controversies around the role of testosterone in the pathophysiology of CVD and surrounding the use of testosterone treatment and its effects on the cardiovascular system and CVD.;"Imperial Coll London, Vasc Biol, Natl Heart & Lung Inst, London, England; Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Cardiol, London, England";Webb, CM (corresponding author), Royal Brompton Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Sydney St, London SW3 6NP, England.;"c.webb@imperial.ac.uk; peter.collins@imperial.ac.uk";;Webb, Carolyn/0000-0002-2538-6953;;;;68;3;3;0;2;RADCLIFFE CARDIOLOGY;BUCKS;UNIT F, BOURNE END BUSINESS PARK, BOURNE END, BUCKS, SL8 5AS, ENGLAND;1758-3756;;;EUR CARDIOL REV;Eur.

The document focuses on general reporting and specific pathological conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery and valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and systemic diseases. Methods and results Demographic data (age, body surface area, blood pressure, and heart rhythm and rate), type (vendor and model) of ultrasound system used and image quality need to be reported. In addition, measurements should be normalized for body size. Reference normal values, derived by ASE/EACVI recommendations, shall always be reported to differentiate normal from pathological conditions. This Expert Consensus document suggests avoiding the surveillance of specific variable using different ultrasound techniques (e.g. in echo labs with high expertise in left ventricular ejection fraction by 3D and not by 2D echocardiography). The report should be also tailored in relation with different cardiac pathologies, quality of images, and needs of the caregivers. Conclusion The conclusion should be concise reflecting the status of left ventricular structure and function, the presence of left atrial and/or aortic dilation, right ventricular dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension, leading to an objective communication with the patient health caregiver. Variation over time should be considered carefully, taking always into account the consistency of the parameters used for comparison.;"[Galderisi, Maurizio; Santoro, Ciro] Federico II Univ Hosp, Interdept Lab Cardiac Imaging, Naples, Italy; [Cosyns, Bernard] Univ Ziekenhuis Brussel, CHVZ Ctr Hart Vaatziekten, Brussels, Belgium; [Cosyns, Bernard] ICMI In Vivo Cellular & Mol Imaging Lab, Brussels, Belgium; [Edvardsen, Thor] Univ Oslo, Dept Cardiol, Oslo Univ Hosp, Rikshosp, Oslo, Norway; [Cardim, Nuno] Hosp da Luz, Echocardiog Lab, Lisbon, Portugal; [Delgado, Victoria] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Cardiol, NL-2300 RC Leiden, Netherlands; [Di Salvo, Giovanni] Royal Brompton Hosp, Pediat Cardiol, London, England; [Donal, Erwan] Univ Rennes 1, Cardiol, LTSI INSERM U1099, CHU Rennes, Rennes, France; [Sade, Leyla Elif] Baskent Univ, Ankara, Turkey; [Ernande, Laura] Univ Paris Est Creteil, Henri Mondor Hosp, AP HP, Dept Physiol,INSERM U955,DHU ATVB, Creteil, France; [Garbi, Madalina] Kings Coll Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Denmark Hill, London SE5 9RS, England; [Grapsa, Julia] Imperial Coll London, Dept Cardiovascular Sci, London, England; [Hagendorff, Andreas] Univ Leipzig, Dept Cardiol Angiol, Echokardiog Labore Univ Klinikums AoR, Leipzig, Germany; [Kamp, Otto] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Med Ctr, Dept Cardiol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Magne, Julien] CHU Limoges, Hop Dupuytren, Serv Cardiol, F-87042 Limoges, France; [Stefanidis, Alexandros] Gen Hosp Nikea, Dept Cardiol 1, 3 P Mela Str, Athens 18454, Greece; [Lancellotti, Patrizio] Univ Liege Hosp, GIGA Cardiovasc Sci, Heart Valve Clin, Imaging Cardiol, Liege, Belgium; [Lancellotti, Patrizio] Anthea Hosp, Grp Villa Maria Care & Res, Bari, Italy; [Popescu, Bogdan] Univ Med & Pharm Carol Davila Euroecolab, Inst Cardiovasc Dis, Bucharest, Romania; [Habib, Gilbert] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Aix Marseille Univ, URMITE, UM63,CNRS 7278,IRD 198,INSERM 1095, Marseille, France; [Habib, Gilbert] La Timone Hosp, APHM, Cardiol Dept, Blvd Jean Moulin, F-13005 Marseille, France";Galderisi, M (corresponding author), Federico II Univ Hosp, Interdept Lab Cardiac Imaging, Naples, Italy.;mgalderi@unina.it;"donal, erwan/ABC-9736-2020; Edvardsen, Thor/F-4079-2012; Santoro, Ciro/Y-6252-2019; Popescu, Bogdan A/A-4528-2011; Gimelli, Alessia/G-4168-2018; Di Salvo, Giovanni/O-7033-2015";"Edvardsen, Thor/0000-0002-3800-765X; Popescu, Bogdan A/0000-0001-6122-8533; kamp, otto/0000-0003-2707-2090; Gerber, Bernhard/0000-0003-1708-8558; Haugaa, Kristina/0000-0002-4900-0453; Gimelli, Alessia/0000-0003-3378-1723; delgado, victoria/0000-0002-9841-2737; Di Salvo, Giovanni/0000-0002-0305-0113";;;;74;115;119;1;20;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;2047-2404;2047-2412;;EUR HEART J-CARD IMG;Eur.

In order to create a non-destructive method which can be used in the field, a system was developed to find and classify six types of vegetative structures on coffee branches: leaves, stems, flowers, unripe fruits, semi-ripe fruits, and ripe fruits. Videos were obtained from 12 coffee branches in field conditions, using the rear camera of a mobile device. Approximately 90 frames, those which had the most information from the scene, were selected from each video. Next, a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction was generated using the Structure from Motion (SfM) and Patch-based Multi-view Stereo (PMVS) techniques for each branch. All acquired images were manually recorded, and a Ground Truth point cloud was generated for each branch. The generated point clouds were filtered using a statistical outliers filter, in order to eliminate noise generated in the 3D reconstruction process. The points that were located in the deepest part were considered to be the scene background, and were removed using a band-pass filter. Point clouds were sub-sampled using a VoxelGrid filter, to reduce the number of points to 50% and therefore reduce computation time of the processes that followed. Various two-dimensional (2D) and 3D features were taken from the point clouds: 11 based on RGB, Lab, Luv, YCbCr, and HSV color space, four based on curvatures, and the remaining two based on shape and curvedness indexes. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) was trained with the previously mentioned features by using eight branches for the training stage, and four branches for the validation stage. Experimental results showed a precision of 0.82 and a recall of 0.79, when classifying said vegetative structures. The proposed system is economical, as only a mobile device is needed to obtain information. Remaining system processes were performed offline. Additionally, the system developed was not affected by changes in lighting conditions, when recording videos on a coffee plantation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, the operational use of these data in automated procedures to support forest inventories and forest management is still limited to a small number of cases. The reasons for this are high data costs, limited availability of remote sensing data over large areas and resistance from practitioners. In this review the main aim is to stimulate debate about spaceborne very high resolution stereo-imagery (VHRSI) as an alternative to airborne remote sensing data by presenting: (1) a case study on the retrieval of stand density, aboveground biomass and tree species using a set of easy-to-calculate variables obtained from VHRSI data combined with image processing and nonparametric classification and modelling approaches; and (2) the results of an expert opinion survey on the potential of VHRSI as compared with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), hyperspectral and airborne digital imagery to derive a range of forest inventory attributes. In the case study, stand density was estimated with r(2) = 0.71 and RMSE = 156 trees (rel./norm. RMSE = 24.9 per cent/12.4 per cent), biomass with r(2) = 0.64 and RMSE of 36.7 t/ha (rel./norm. RMSE = 20.0 per cent/12.8 per cent) while tree species classifications with five species reached overall accuracies of 84.2 per cent (kappa = 0.81). These results were comparable to earlier studies in the same test site, obtained with more expensive airborne acquisitions. Expert opinions were more diverse for VHRSI and aerial photographs (Shannon index values of 0.94 and 0.97) than for LiDAR and hyperspectral data (Shannon index values 0.69 and 0.88). In our opinion, this reflects the current state-of-the-art in the application of VHRSI for automatically retrieving forest inventory attributes. The number of studies using these data is still limited, and the full potential of these datasets is not yet completely explored. Compared with LiDAR and hyperspectral data, which both mostly received high scores for forest inventory products matching the sensor systems' strengths, VHRSI and aerial photographs received more homogeneous scores indicating their potential as multi-purpose instruments to collect forest inventory information. In summary, considering the simpler acquisition, reasonable price and the comparably easy data format and handling of VHRSI compared with other sensor types, we recommend further research on the application of these data for supporting operational forest inventories.";"[Fassnacht, Fabian Ewald; Mangold, Daniel; Schaefer, Jannika; Kattenborn, Teja] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Reinhard Baumeister Pl 1, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Immitzer, Markus] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Surveying Remote Sensing & Land Informat IVF, Vienna BOKU, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Koch, Barbara] Univ Freiburg, Remote Sensing & Landscape Informat Syst, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; [Latifi, Hooman] Univ Wurzburg, German Aerosp Ctr, Dept Remote Sensing, Oswald Kuelpe Weg 86, D-97074 Wurzburg, Germany";Fassnacht, FE (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Geog & Geoecol, Reinhard Baumeister Pl 1, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.;fabian.fassnacht@kit.edu;"Kattenborn, Teja/I-7457-2019; Latifi, Hooman/AAE-9313-2020; Immitzer, Markus/D-9097-2016; Fassnacht, Fabian/AAL-5524-2020; Fassnacht, Fabian/F-3860-2017";"Kattenborn, Teja/0000-0001-7381-3828; Latifi, Hooman/0000-0003-1054-889X; Immitzer, Markus/0000-0001-6758-1207; Fassnacht, Fabian/0000-0003-1284-9573";German National Space Agency DLR (Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.) on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Economy and Technology on the basis of a decision by the German Bundestag [50EE1265];German National Space Agency DLR (Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.) on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Economy and Technology on the basis of a decision by the German Bundestag.

A common practice is to make litters more equally sized by moving piglets from large litters to smaller to make sure that all piglets get an own teat to suckle. Litter equalization is not always enough, as many sows have large litters and/or damaged teats, which results in an insufficient number of available teats. One way to solve this problem is to use nurse sows. A nurse sow raises, and weans, her own piglets before receiving a foster litter. The objectives of this study were to address how the use of nurse sows affects the welfare of sows and piglets and to explore how it impacts the contribution margin of pig production in Sweden. A literature search was made to investigate welfare aspects on sows and piglets. As there were few published studies on nurse sows, an expert group meeting was organized. In order to explore the impact on the contribution margin of pig production, a partial budgeting approach with stochastic elements was used for a fictive pig farm. Standard templates for calculating costs and benefits were supplemented with figures from existing literature and the gathered expert opinions. In Sweden, the minimum suckling period is 28 days while published studies involving nurse sows, all from outside of Sweden, weaned the piglets at 21 days. A Swedish nurse sow will thus get longer lactation period which might increase the risk of poor body condition, damaged teats, and shoulder ulcers. This indicates a reduced welfare of the sow and may lead to impaired fertility and increased culling risk. On the other hand, the piglet mortality could be reduced with the use of nurse sows, but the separation and mixing of piglets could be stressful. The partial budgeting suggested that the nurse sow system is slightly more profitable (+6,838 Swedish krona) per farrowing group during one dry and one lactation period compared to the conventional system. The result is, however, highly dependent on the input values, and welfare aspects were not considered in the calculations.;"[Alvasen, Karin; Emanuelson, Ulf] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Div Ruminant Med & Epidemiol, Dept Clin Sci, Uppsala, Sweden; [Hansson, Helena] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Westin, Rebecka] Gard & Djurhalsan, Skara, Sweden";Alvasen, K (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Div Ruminant Med & Epidemiol, Dept Clin Sci, Uppsala, Sweden.;karin.alvasen@slu.se;"Emanuelson, Ulf/AAC-7809-2020; Alvasen, Karin/D-8115-2016";"Emanuelson, Ulf/0000-0001-7889-417X; Alvasen, Karin/0000-0001-7321-7030; Hansson, Helena/0000-0001-9609-4387";Svenska Djurskyddsforeningen;This study was funded by Svenska Djurskyddsforeningen.;;21;4;4;1;6;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;2297-1769;;;FRONT VET SCI;Front.

Information about LTC preferences is important to decision-makers in future reforms. Taking into account the preferences of people can lead to a better congruence between desired and utilized LTC services. The aim of this study was to evaluate LTC preferences, their underlying reasons, and the potential to satisfy individual preferences within the German LTC insurance system. Methods Interviews with 20 LTC (insurance) experts in Germany between July and September 2014 were analyzed using qualitative content analysis methods. Results Irrespective of the care setting, people prefer flexible LTC (services), which allow for as much autonomy and independence as possible. Ideally, care is provided by close relatives at the dependent's home. Besides informal homecare, professional care at home is also (becoming increasingly) important, whereas inpatient LTC (nursing home) is rarely preferred over homecare arrangements. To most LTC dependents, interpersonal needs are more important than bodily and professional aspects of care. Conclusion While the flexible choices and manifold options to combine services (high degree of person-centeredness) within the German LTC insurance constitute an important basis for the satisfaction of individual preferences, the widespread lack of information about entitlements, costs of services, and corresponding LTC options in the general population (future dependents) substantially hampers long- term care that is in line with preferences.;"[Heuchert, M.; Konig, H-H.; Lehnert, T.] Univ Klinikum Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Gesundheitsokon & Versorgungsforsch, Martinistr 52, D-20251 Hamburg, Germany";Lehnert, T (corresponding author), Univ Klinikum Hamburg Eppendorf, Inst Gesundheitsokon & Versorgungsforsch, Martinistr 52, D-20251 Hamburg, Germany.;t.lehnert@uke.de;Konig, Hans-Helmut/P-1211-2018;Konig, Hans-Helmut/0000-0001-5711-6862;;;;33;12;12;2;18;GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG;STUTTGART;RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY;0941-3790;1439-4421;;GESUNDHEITSWESEN;Gesundheitswesen;DEC;2017;79;12;;;;;1052;1057;;10.1055/s-0041-111839;;;6;Public, Environmental & Occupational Health;Public, Environmental & Occupational Health;FR3HI;WOS:000418957000019;26990612;;;;2021-02-18;

This Roadmap focuses on atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is the most common, clinically significant arrhythmia and, among other clinical outcomes, is associated with increased risk of stroke. Methods: Development of this Roadmap included a review of published guidelines and research papers, and consultation with an expert committee comprising experts in clinical management of AF and health systems research in LMICs. The Roadmap identifies 1) key interventions for detection, diagnosis, and management of AF; 2) gaps in implementation of these interventions (knowledge-practice gaps); 3) health system roadblocks to implementation of AF interventions in LMICs; and 4) potential strategies for overcoming these. Results: More research is needed on determinants and primary prevention of AF. Knowledge-practice gaps for detection, diagnosis, and management of AF are present worldwide, but may be more prominent in LMICs. Potential barriers to implementation of AF interventions include long distances to health facilities, shortage of health care professionals with training in AF, including interpretation of ECG, unaffordability of oral anticoagulants for patient households, reluctance on the part of physicians to initiate oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy, and lack of awareness of the importance of persistent adherence to OAC therapy. Potential solutions include training of nonphysician health workers and pharmacists in pulse-taking, use of telemedicine technologies to transmit electrocardiogram results, engagement of nonphysician health workers in OAC therapy adherence support, and country-specific support and education programs for noncardiologist health care professionals. Conclusions: AF affects millions of people worldwide and, left untreated, increases the risk and severity of stroke and heart failure. Although guidelines for the detection, diagnosis, and management of AF exist, there are gaps in implementation of these guidelines globally, and in particular in LMICs. This Roadmap identifies some potential solutions that may improve AF outcomes in LMICs but require further evaluation in these settings.";"[Murphy, Adrianna] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, Ctr Hlth & Social Change, London, England; [Banerjeey, Amitava] UCL, Farr Inst Hlth Informat Res, London, England; [Breithardt, Guenter] Univ Hosp Munster, Div Clin & Expt Electrophysiol, Dept Cardiovasc Med, Munster, Germany; [Breithardt, Guenter] Atrial Fibrillat Network eV AFNET, Munster, Germany; [Camm, A.

This article provides a reflection on this question from a panel of health financing and gender experts. We trace the evidence of how health-financing reforms have impacted gender and health access through a general literature review and a more detailed case-study of India. We find that unless explicit attention is paid to gender and its intersectionality with other social stratifications, through explicit protection and careful linking of benefits to needs of target populations (e.g. poor women, unemployed men, female-headed households), movement towards UHC can fail to achieve gender balance or improve equity, and may even exacerbate gender inequity. Political trade-offs are made on the road to UHC and the needs of less powerful groups, which can include women and children, are not necessarily given priority. We identify the need for closer collaboration between health economists and gender experts, and highlight a number of research gaps in this field which should be addressed. While some aspects of cost sharing and some analysis of expenditure on maternal and child health have been analysed from a gender perspective, there is a much richer set of research questions to be explored to guide policy making. Given the political nature of UHC decisions, political economy as well as technical research should be prioritized. We conclude that countries should adopt an equitable approach towards achieving UHC and, therefore, prioritize high-need groups and those requiring additional financial protection, in particular women and children.

Identifying adenomas is important because they may eventually become cancerous if untreated, whereas hyperplastic polyps do not usually develop into cancer, and a surveillance interval is set based on the number and size of adenomas found. Virtual chromoendoscopy (VCE) (an electronic endoscopic imaging technique) could be used by the endoscopist under strictly controlled conditions for real-time optical diagnosis of diminutive (<= 5 mm) colorectal polyps to replace histopathological diagnosis. Objective: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the VCE technologies narrow-band imaging (NBI), flexible spectral imaging colour enhancement (FICE) and i-scan for the characterisation and management of diminutive (<= 5 mm) colorectal polyps using high-definition (HD) systems without magnification. Design: Systematic review and economic analysis. Participants: People undergoing colonoscopy for screening or surveillance or to investigate symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer. Interventions: NBI, FICE and i-scan. Main outcome measures: Diagnostic accuracy, recommended surveillance intervals, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), adverse effects, incidence of colorectal cancer, mortality and cost-effectiveness of VCE compared with histopathology. Data sources: Electronic bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects were searched for published English-language studies from inception to June 2016. Bibliographies of related papers, systematic reviews and company information were screened and experts were contacted to identify additional evidence. Review methods: Systematic reviews of test accuracy and economic evaluations were undertaken in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Meta-analyses were conducted, where possible, to inform the independent economic model. A cost-utility decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of VCE compared with histopathology. The model used a decision tree for patients undergoing endoscopy, combined with estimates of long-term outcomes (e.g. incidence of colorectal cancer and subsequent morbidity and mortality) derived from University of Sheffield School of Health and Related Research's bowel cancer screening model. The model took a NHS perspective, with costs and benefits discounted at 3.5% over a lifetime horizon. There were limitations in the data on the distribution of adenomas across risk categories and recurrence rates post polypectomy. Results: Thirty test accuracy studies were included: 24 for NBI, five for i-scan and three for FICE (two studies assessed two interventions). Polyp assessments made with high confidence were associated with higher sensitivity and endoscopists experienced in VCE achieved better results than those without experience. Two economic evaluations were included. NBI, i-scan and FICE are cost-saving strategies compared with histopathology and the number of quality-adjusted life-years gained was similar for histopathology and VCE. The correct surveillance interval would be given to 95% of patients with NBI, 94% of patients with FICE and 97% of patients with i-scan. Limitations: Limited evidence was available for i-scan and FICE and there was heterogeneity among the NBI studies. There is a lack of data on longer-term health outcomes of patients undergoing VCE for assessment of diminutive colorectal polyps. Conclusions: VCE technologies, using HD systems without magnification, could potentially be used for the real-time assessment of diminutive colorectal polyps, if endoscopists have adequate experience and training. Future work: Future research priorities include head-to-head randomised controlled trials of all three VCE technologies; more research on the diagnostic accuracy of FICE and i-scan (when used without magnification); further studies evaluating the impact of endoscopist experience and training on outcomes; studies measuring adverse effects, HRQoL and anxiety; and longitudinal data on colorectal cancer incidence, HRQoL and mortality.";"[Picot, Joanna; Rose, Micah; Cooper, Keith; Pickett, Karen; Lord, Joanne; Harris, Petra; Shepherd, Jonathan] Univ Southampton, SHTAC, Southampton, Hants, England; [Whyte, Sophie] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Bohning, Dankmar] Univ Southampton, Southampton Stat Sci Res Inst S3RI, Math Sci, Southampton, Hants, England";Picot, J (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, SHTAC, Southampton, Hants, England.;;Lord, Joanne/H-1417-2011;"Lord, Joanne/0000-0003-1086-1624; Bohning, Dankmar/0000-0003-0638-7106; Shepherd, Jonathan/0000-0003-1682-4330; Pickett, Karen/0000-0002-8631-6465";National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programmeNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR);The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.;;166;6;6;0;6;NIHR JOURNALS LIBRARY;SOUTHAMPTON;UNIV SOUTHAMPTON, EVALUATION, TRIALS & STUDIES COORDINATING CENTRE, ALPHA HOUSE, ENTERPRISE RD, SOUTHAMPTON, SO16 7NS, ENGLAND;1366-5278;2046-4924;;HEALTH TECHNOL ASSES;Health Technol.

By interpreting a communications system as an autoencoder, we develop a fundamental new way to think about communications system design as an end-to-end reconstruction task that seeks to jointly optimize transmitter and receiver components in a single process. We show how this idea can be extended to networks of multiple transmitters and receivers and present the concept of radio transformer networks as a means to incorporate expert domain knowledge in the machine learning model. Lastly, we demonstrate the application of convolutional neural networks on raw IQ samples for modulation classification which achieves competitive accuracy with respect to traditional schemes relying on expert features.

Cases studies of the proposed system application in three cement factories in Algeria, SCAEK (Setif), SCIMAT (Batna), and SCT (Tebessa), are discussed. The remote process control consists of alarms generated during running of the processes while maintaining and synchronizing different regulation loops thus ensuring automatic running of processes smoothly. In addition, fuzzy control of the kiln and the other two mills ensures that the system is operational at all times with minimal downtime. The process control system contains different operator station (OP), alarms table and a provision to monitor trends analysis. The operator can execute any operation according to his authorised access assigned by the system administrator using user administration tool. The Internet technology is used for human security by avoiding all times presence of operators at site for maintenance. Further, in case of a breakdown, the problem would be remotely diagnosed and resolved avoiding requirement of an expert on site thus eliminating traveling cost, security risks, visa formalities, etc. These trips are difficult to organize (costs, visas, risks). So the enterprise can reduce downtimes and travel costs. In order to realize a process control system guided by operators in the main control room or through Internet, the process control is based on programming in PCS 7 utilizing Cemat library and Fuzzy Control++ Siemens tools.;"[Zermane, Hanane; Mouss, Hayet] Batna 2 Univ, Ind Engn Dept, Lab Automat & Mfg, Batna 05000, Algeria";Zermane, H (corresponding author), Batna 2 Univ, Ind Engn Dept, Lab Automat & Mfg, Batna 05000, Algeria.;"hananezermane@yahoo.fr; hayet_mouss@yahoo.fr";;zermane, hanane/0000-0003-4167-2578;;;;26;3;4;1;7;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1476-8186;1751-8520;;INT J AUTOM COMPUT;Int.

To further it, the concept of intuition was introduced into nursing in the 1970s. Benner's theory proposed that greater use of intuition was linked to higher clinical competence; however, there is still a paucity of data to verify this theory. Therefore, the current study was conducted to assess the relationship between the use of intuition in clinical practice and the clinical competence of critical care nurses. Methods: In this correlational study, 88 critical care nurses were recruited as convenience. The tools included a 'use of intuition in clinical practice' scale devised by the researcher, and a 'clinical competence' instrument. The gathered data were analyzed by SPSS version 20.0 software, using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: Of the 88 participants, 73.9% were women and 93.2% were at undergraduate level. The mean and standard deviation of participants' age and work experience was 32.29 +/- 6.75 and 7.40 +/- 5.68 years, respectively. The Pearson correlation test revealed no significant connection between the use of intuition in clinical practice and the clinical competence of critical care nurses (r = 0.091, P = 0.398), and produced similar results from the various demographic groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: In this study, no significant correlation between the use of intuition and clinical competence in critical care nurses was found. This could be attributed to intuition as a nursing skill being almost excluded from the educational curriculum of nursing schools, and some background factors.";"[Hassani, Parkhide] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Fac Nursing & Midwifery, Tehran, Iran; [Abdi, Alireza; Jalali, Rostam; Salari, Nader] Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Fac Nursing & Midwifery, Kermanshah, Iran";Abdi, A (corresponding author), Kermanshah Univ Med Sci, Fac Nursing & Midwifery, Kermanshah, Iran.;A_abdi61@yahoo.com;"Jalali, Rostam/V-5820-2017; Salari, Nader/AAN-4849-2020";"Jalali, Rostam/0000-0003-1781-9939; Salari, Nader/0000-0003-3550-405X";;;;41;1;1;0;5;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;1744-1609;1744-1595;;INT J EVID-BASED HEA;Int.

Due to its technical core, the current research focused on its technical fundamentals, whereas the economic discussion is still in its infancy. This paper aims at painting a comprehensive and structured picture of IIoT-related economic, ecological, and social benefits and challenges.

Our study contributes to the sparse body of scientific IIoT literature by analysing the IIoT's implications according to the TBL.

The devices are the results of experimental sessions with chronic stroke patients and consultations with clinical experts. Both devices share a common principle of work, which consists in opposing the device to the paretic hand or wrist so to restrain the motion of an object. They can be used by chronic stroke patients to compensate for grasping in several activities of daily living (ADLs) with a particular focus on bimanual tasks. The robotic extra fingers are designed to be extremely portable and wearable. They can be wrapped as bracelets when not being used, to further reduce the encumbrance. Both devices are intrinsically compliant and driven by a single actuator through a tendon system. The motion of the robotic devices can be controlled using an electromyography-based interface embedded in a cap. The interface allows the user to control the device motion by contracting the frontalis muscle. The performance characteristics of the devices have been measured experimentally and the shape adaptability has been confirmed by grasping various objects with different shapes. We tested the devices through qualitative experiments based on ADLs involving five chronic stroke patients. The prototypes successfully enabled the patients to complete various bimanual tasks. Results show that the proposed robotic devices improve the autonomy of patients in ADLs and allow them to complete tasks that were previously impossible to perform.;"[Hussain, Irfan; Spagnoletti, Giovanni; Salvietti, Gionata; Prattichizzo, Domenico] Univ Siena, Dept Informat Engn, Via Roma 56, Siena, Italy; [Salvietti, Gionata; Prattichizzo, Domenico] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Genoa, Italy";Hussain, I (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dept Informat Engn, Via Roma 56, Siena, Italy.;irfan.hussain@unisi.it;"SALVIETTI, GIONATA/AAB-8755-2019; Hussain, Irfan/AAA-3458-2019";"SALVIETTI, GIONATA/0000-0001-9170-4051; Hussain, Irfan/0000-0003-2759-0306";European Union's Horizon Research and Innovation Programme of the project SoftPro: Synergy-based Open-source Foundations and Technologies for Prosthetics and RehabilitatiOn [688857];The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme of the project SoftPro: Synergy-based Open-source Foundations and Technologies for Prosthetics and RehabilitatiOn (grant number 688857).;;64;12;13;4;30;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0278-3649;1741-3176;;INT J ROBOT RES;Int.

Trajectory segmentation algorithms can be sensitive to noise, spurious motions, and temporal variation. We present a new unsupervised segmentation algorithm, transition state clustering (TSC), which leverages repeated demonstrations of a task by clustering segment endpoints across demonstrations. TSC complements any motion-based segmentation algorithm by identifying candidate transitions, clustering them by kinematic similarity, and then correlating the kinematic clusters with available sensory and temporal features. TSC uses a hierarchical Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model to avoid selecting the number of segments a priori. We present simulated results to suggest that TSC significantly reduces the number of false-positive segments in dynamical systems observed with noise as compared with seven probabilistic and non-probabilistic segmentation algorithms. We additionally compare algorithms that use piecewise linear segment models, and find that TSC recovers segments of a generated piecewise linear trajectory with greater accuracy in the presence of process and observation noise. At the maximum noise level, TSC recovers the ground truth 49% more accurately than alternatives. Furthermore, TSC runs 100x faster than the next most accurate alternative autoregressive models, which require expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based inference. We also evaluated TSC on 67 recordings of surgical needle passing and suturing. We supplemented the kinematic recordings with manually annotated visual features that denote grasp and penetration conditions. On this dataset, TSC finds 83% of needle passing transitions and 73% of the suturing transitions annotated by human experts.;"[Krishnan, Sanjay; Garg, Animesh; Patil, Sachin; Abbeel, Pieter; Goldberg, Ken] Univ Calif Berkeley, Soda Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lea, Colin; Hager, Gregory] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA";Krishnan, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Soda Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;sanjay@eecs.berkeley.edu;;;"UC Berkeley Center for Information Technology in the Interest of Society (CITRIS); UC Berkeley AMPLab; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IIS-1227536]; Google; Cisco";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported in part by a seed grant from the UC Berkeley Center for Information Technology in the Interest of Society (CITRIS), the UC Berkeley AMPLab, and by the US National Science Foundation (Award IIS-1227536: Multilateral Manipulation by Human-Robot Collaborative Systems).

Thirty-three saffron samples from different geographical regions were tested. Fourteen color features were extracted using image analysis. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for saffron sample clustering and for selection of color features. Partial Least Squares (PLS), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks were utilized to establish relationships between color features and coloring strength of saffron based on ISO 3632 standard. Experimental results showed that the optimal PCA was obtained by the first 2 PCs and with 95% total variance between the samples tested. Performance of MLP models for saffron color characterization were better than others, with high correlation coefficients of the cross validation (R-2 and RMSE values equal to 99% and 4.5, respectively) and high classification success rate of 96.67%.;"[Minaei, Saeid; Kiani, Sajad] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Biosyst Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Ayyari, Mahdi] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Hort Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Ghasemi-Varnamkhasti, Mahdi] Shahrekord Univ, Dept Mech Engn Biosyst, Shahrekord, Iran";Minaei, S (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Biosyst Engn, Tehran, Iran.;minaee@modares.ac.ir;;Ghasemi-Varnamkhasti, Mahdi/0000-0001-6339-2062;;;;30;3;3;1;7;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;2214-7861;;;J APPL RES MED AROMA;J.

Given the availability of data, responsiveness of ruminal pH to animal behaviors, and the chemical composition and physical form of the diet, mean ruminal pH was chosen as the primary rumen environment indicator. Physically effective fiber (peNDF) is defined as the fraction of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) that stimulates chewing activity and contributes to the floating mat of large particles in the rumen. The peNDF of feedstuffs is typically estimated by multiplying the NDF content by a particle size measure, resulting in an estimated index of effectiveness. We hypothesized that the utility of peNDF could be expanded and improved by dissociating NDF and particle size and considering other dietary factors, all integrated into a physically adjusted fiber system that can be used to estimate minimum particle sizes of TMR and diet compositions needed to maintain ruminal pH targets. Particle size measures of TMR were limited to those found with the Penn State particle separator (PSPS). Starting with specific diet characteristics, the system employed an ensemble of models that were integrated using a variable mixture of experts approach to generate more robust recommendations for the percentage of dietary DM material that should be retained on the 8-mm sieve of a PSPS. Additional continuous variables also integrated in the physically adjusted fiber system include the proportion of material (dry matter basis) retained on the 19- and 8-mm sieves of the PSPS, estimated mean particle size, the dietary concentrations of forage, forage NDF, starch, and NDF, and ruminally degraded starch and NDF. The system was able to predict that the minimum proportion of material (dry matter basis) retained on the 8-mm sieve should increase with decreasing forage NDF or dietary NDF. Additionally, the minimum proportion of dry matter material on the 8-mm sieve should increase with increasing dietary starch. Results of this study agreed with described interrelationships between the chemical and physical form of diets fed to dairy cows and quantified the links between NDF intake, diet particle size, and ruminal pH. Feeding recommendations can be interpolated from tables and figures included in this work.;"[White, Robin R.] Virginia Tech, Dept Anim & Poultry Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA; [Hall, Mary Beth] US Dairy Forage Res Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Firkins, Jeffrey L.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Anim Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kononoff, Paul J.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Anim Sci, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA";Kononoff, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Anim Sci, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.;pkononoff2@unl.edu;Kononoff, Paul James/ABB-1384-2020;White, Robin/0000-0001-5713-012X;"Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (Washington, DC) [2015-03656]; USDA-Agricultural Research Service (Washington, DC)";The authors thank Keri Rogan (USDA-ARS, Madison, WI) and Jared Judy (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) for their efforts related to data entry.

Instead, research has focused on intervention effectiveness embedded within the positivist paradigm. The purpose of this study was to explore how expert neurorehabilitation therapists conceptualize movement as part of their clinical reasoning. MethodA qualitative interpretive descriptive approach consisting of stimulated recall using video-recorded treatment sessions and in-depth interviews was used. Theoretical sampling was used to recruit members of the International Bobath Instructors Training Association (IBITA) who are recognized experts in neurorehabilitation. Interview transcripts were transcribed verbatim. Data analysis was progressive, iterative, and inductive. ResultsTwenty-two IBITA instructors from 7 different countries volunteered to participate. They ranged in clinical experience from 12 to 40years and instructor experience from 1 to 35years. The conceptualization of movement by the IBITA instructors involves the following elements: (1) movement comprises the whole person and the whole body, not just individual body segments; (2) active alignment of body segments is integral to movement performance; and (3) efficient movement requires the relative integration of postural control/stability and selective movement/mobility. ConclusionsThe IBITA instructors conceptualize movement from a person-centred perspective. The integration of postural control and selective movement, with alignment and variability as key components, forms the foundation of their understanding of movement. Further investigation into the role of postural control in movement recovery post central nervous system lesion is required. Likewise, the dimensions of movement critical to the conceptualization of movement are not well understood from the perspective of the physiotherapist or persons with neurological impairments.";"[Vaughan-Graham, Julie; Patterson, Kara; Zabjek, Karl; Cott, Cheryl A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Phys Therapy, 160-500 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1V7, Canada";Vaughan-Graham, J (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Phys Therapy, 160-500 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1V7, Canada.;julie.vaughan.graham@utoronto.ca;Patterson, Kara Kathleen/O-7804-2019;;IBITA Research Grant;Partial funding for this study was provided by an IBITA Research Grant.

Cartography was initiated during this period by Pei Xiu, a minister and cartographic expert, who suggested six principles of cartography. Pei Xiu, who is known as the father of Chinese cartography, oversaw the completion of the Yu Gong Regional Maps, along with 18 articles and the Terrain Fangzhang Map (AD 224-271). This led to a number of subsequent cartographic initiatives including the Wooden Fangzhang Map (an administrative map) which was completed by Xie Zhuang, a minister during the Southern Dynasties (AD 502-557), Haineihuayi Tu (Map of China and its neighbouring countries) (AD 730-805), drawn by Jia Dan, a cartographer of the Tang Dynasty, and Shouling Tu (an administrative map, AD 1031-1095), drawn by Shen Kuo, a scientist during the Northern Song Dynasty. Throughout the 16th century, ancient Chinese cartography developed continuously and cumulatively, and formed the specific characteristics of China ancient cartography. Although Western latitude- based and longitude-based mapping techniques introduced to China in AD 1460, the theories and methods of Chinese and Western mapping systems co-existed for over 400 years. The cultural heritage of Chinese cartography can be seen in many famous ancient Chinese maps, including astronomical figures and atlases (world, Chinese, regional, military, water conservancy, historical, and educational maps), charts, and maps of scenic spots. These have hitherto been kept in well-known archives and institutions across the world. They form an important part of the global cultural heritage of ancient maps and cartography. Given their high cultural value, these maps remain an important point of study. This paper provides a preliminary discussion on the rarity, application, and the historical, scientific, and artistic value of ancient Chinese maps.;"[Jiang Lili; Qi Qingwen] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Jiang Lili; Liang Qizhang; Qi Qingwen; Liang Xun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ye Yanjun] Hebei Univ Engn, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Handan 056038, Hebei, Peoples R China";"Qi, QW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Qi, QW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.";"jiangll@igsnrr.ac.cn; qiqw@igsnrr.ac.cn";;;"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41101447]; Basic Science-technological Special Working: Compilation of the National Atlases of the People's Republic of China (New Century Version) [2013FY112800]; Ministry of Science and Technology, ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2012FY120200]";"Foundation: National Natural Science Foundation of China, No.41101447; Basic Science-technological Special Working: Compilation of the National Atlases of the People's Republic of China (New Century Version), No.2013FY112800; Foundation Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology, China, No.2012FY120200";;31;0;0;1;30;SCIENCE PRESS;BEIJING;16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA;1009-637X;1861-9568;;J GEOGR SCI;J.

However, this scheme is complex and carries significant financial risks because of the characteristics of the water sector and the involvement of public-private stakeholders with new and extended responsibilities, large private capital, and long contract duration. Drawing on the Nungua Seawater Desalination Plant (NSDP) in Ghana, this study seeks to identify and assess the critical financial risks associated with BOOT water supply projects and evaluate the financial risk level of the NSDP project. The risks and their relative criticality on the NSDP project are investigated by using a questionnaire survey method. The questionnaire was formulated with a set of 18 risks derived from extant literature and project documentation. Perceived critical financial risks affecting the NSDP project were assessed by a team of experts who had direct involvement in the project. A fuzzy synthetic evaluation suggests that the project is financially risky and that all the risks are critical to the project. Bankruptcy of consortium members, unfavorable economy of the host country, uncertainty in tariff adjustment of water products, rate of return restrictions, and availability problem of private capital are the five most highly-ranked risks. The fuzzy technique is used to represent and model experiential knowledge of the survey participants and to address the fuzziness of their expert judgments. The study's results facilitate prioritization of risks and a comprehensive risk management program during the lifecycle of the case project and future projects. The fuzzy technique is suitable for early phases of BOOT projects to prioritize the risks that require a detailed analysis and to predict the risk level of a project.

In the research herein reported we present a novel medical framework called web-based integration for vascular expert research networks (Wivern) to be used in a multi-clinical department environment for the analysis of micro and macrocirculation. This tool can manage clinical information of several specialties, such as Neurology or Ophthalmology, and provides computer-aided tools to automatically analyze retinographies, carotid ultrasounds and blood pressure monitor signals, and to automatically compute cardiovascular risk stratification. Wivern is a web-based application with a user friendly interface that provides cross-platform compatibility and device independence. Several automated procedures are integrated within the framework, as a service on the web, to extract relevant parameters from clinical data, physiological signals and medical images. The application is planned for collecting and analyzing data in several clinical studies in different hospital centers to test their behavior and practical use of the different tools of the platform. The usefulness and validation of the system was achieved after the inclusion, by the different medical units, of 800 patients to analyze their hypertensive profile. Moreover, 800 retinal images were processed as well as 400 carotid were analyzed. Wivern provides a unique opportunity for vascular research since it enables an interdisciplinary and integrated study of the vascular network, allowing a more comprehensive evaluation of the consequences of any abnormality.

The St. George and Wollongong Randomised Breast Boost trial used five different methods of cosmetic assessment, including both subjective and objective, to comprehensively evaluate the cosmetic outcome of the trial patients. This current study analyses the level of concordance between these methods in an attempt to determine a possible standard in the evaluation of breast cosmesis. MethodsPatients attending follow-up clinic reviews at 5years post breast radiotherapy were evaluated. Patients completed a cosmesis and functional assessment questionnaire, assessing clinicians completed an EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) cosmetic rating questionnaire and photographs were obtained. The photographs were later assessed by a panel of five experts, as well as analysed using the objective pBRA (relative Breast Retraction Assessment) and the BCCT.core (Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment.cosmetic results) computer software. Scores were dichotomised to excellent/good and fair/poor. Pairwise comparisons between all methods, except pBRA, were carried out using overall agreement calculations and kappa scores. pBRA scores were compared on a continuous scale with each of the other dichotomised scores obtained by the other four methods. ResultsOf 513 St George patients alive at 5years, 385 (75%) attended St George for follow-up and consented to photography. Results showed that assessment by physicians in clinic and patient self-assessment were more favourable regarding overall cosmetic outcome than evaluation of photographs by the panel or the BCCT.core software. Excellent/good scores by clinician-live and patient self-assessments were 93% and 94% respectively (agreement 89%), as compared to 75% and 74% only by BCCT.core and panel assessments respectively (agreement 83%, kappa 0.57). For the pBRA measurements, there was a statistically significant difference (P <0.001) between scores for excellent/good versus fair/poor cosmesis by all four methods. The range of median pBRA measurements for fair/poor scores was 13.4-14.8 and for excellent/good scores was 8.0-9.4. ConclusionIncorporating both BCCT.core assessment and patient self-assessment could potentially provide the basis of a gold standard method of breast cosmetic evaluation. BCCT.core represents an easy, time efficient, reproducible, cost effective and reliable method, however, it lacks the functional and psychosocial elements of cosmesis that only patient self-reported outcomes can provide.;"[Merie, Roya; Browne, Lois; Chin, Yaw; Clark, Catherine; Graham, Peter; Szwajcer, Alison] St George Canc Care Ctr, Kogarah, NSW, Australia; [Cardoso, Jaime S.] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Oporto, Portugal; [Cardoso, Maria J.] Champalimaud Canc Ctr, Breast Canc Unit, Lisbon, Portugal; [Hau, Eric] Crown Princess Mary Westmead Canc Care Ctr, Westmead, NSW, Australia";Merie, R (corresponding author), Liverpool Canc Therapy Ctr, Liverpool, NSW 2170, Australia.;Roya.Merie@sswahs.nsw.gov.au;"; Cardoso, Jaime/I-3286-2013";"Merie, Roya/0000-0001-7473-7396; Cardoso, Jaime/0000-0002-3760-2473; Cardoso, Maria Joao/0000-0002-8137-3700";;;;36;10;10;0;0;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1754-9477;1754-9485;;J MED IMAG RADIAT ON;J.

Previous research has identified that families want information about the causes of their child's chronic pain, treatment options, and effective strategies to help their child cope with the pain. Unfortunately, parents have reported that finding this information can be challenging. Objective: The aim of this study was to actively work together with children attending a pediatric chronic pain clinic and their parents to develop, refine, and evaluate the usability of an art and narrative-based electronic book (e-book) for pediatric chronic pain. Methods: A multiphase, multi-method research design employing patient engagement techniques was used to develop, refine, and evaluate the usability of an art and narrative based e-book for pediatric chronic pain management to facilitate knowledge translation for parents with a child with chronic pain. The multiple phases included the following: (1) qualitative interviews to compile parents' narratives using qualitative interviews; (2) qualitative data analysis; (3) development of an e-book prototype; (4) expert clinician feedback; (5) parent usability evaluation, knowledge change, and confidence in knowledge responses using an electronic survey; (6) e-book refinement; and (7) dissemination of the e-book. Results: A 48-page e-book was developed to characterize the experiences of a family living with a child with chronic pain. The e-book was a composite narrative of the parent interviews and encompassed descriptions of the effects the condition has on each member of the family. This was merged with the best available research evidence on the day-to-day management of pediatric chronic pain. The e-book was vetted for clinical accuracy by expert pediatric pain clinicians. All parents that participated in the usability evaluation (N=14) agreed or strongly agreed the content of the e-book was easy to understand and stated that they would recommend the e-book to other families who have children with chronic pain. Our research identified up to a 21.4% increase in knowledge after using the e-book, and paired t tests demonstrated a statistically significant difference in confidence in answering two of the five knowledge questions (chronic pain is a disease involving changes in the nervous system; the use of ibuprofen is usually effective at controlling chronic pain); t(13)=0.165, P=.001 and t(13)=0.336, P=.002, respectively, after being exposed to the e-book. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that parents positively rated an e-book developed for parents with a child with chronic pain. Our results also identify that overall, parents' knowledge increased after using the e-book, and confidence in their knowledge about chronic pain and its management increased in two aspects after e-book exposure. These results suggest that art and narrative-based knowledge translation interventions may be useful in transferring complex health information to parents.";"[Reid, Kathy; Le, Anne; Norris, Allison; Scott, Shannon D.] Univ Alberta, Fac Nursing, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Reid, Kathy] Stollery Childrens Hosp, Alberta Hlth Serv, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Hartling, Lisa; Ali, Samina] Univ Alberta, Dept Pediat, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Ali, Samina; Scott, Shannon D.] Univ Alberta, Women & Childrens Hlth Res Inst, Edmonton, AB, Canada";Scott, SD (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Fac Nursing, Edmonton Clin 5 187, Hlth Acad, 11405 87th Ave NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1C9, Canada.;ss14@ualberta.ca;;"Scott, Shannon/0000-0002-2251-3742; Ali, Samina/0000-0002-0595-364X; Le, Anne/0000-0003-0147-1720";"Women and Children's Health Research Institute; Stollery Children's Hospital Foundation; Canada Research Chair (tier 2)Canada Research Chairs";The authors wish to acknowledge the Women and Children's Health Research Institute and the Stollery Children's Hospital Foundation for supporting this research.

Exploring how mobile health (mHealth) technologies can support management for young people with NCDs is imperative. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify, appraise, and synthesize available qualitative evidence on users' experiences of mHealth technologies for NCD management in young people. We explored the perspectives of both end users (young people) and implementers (health policy makers, clinicians, and researchers). Methods: A systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies. Eligibility criteria included full reports published in peer-reviewed journals from January 2007 to December 2016, searched across databases including EMBASE, MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and PsycINFO. All qualitative studies that evaluated the use of mHealth technologies to support young people (in the age range of 15-24 years) in managing their chronic NCDs were considered. Two independent reviewers identified eligible reports and conducted critical appraisal (based on the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument: JBI-QARI). Three reviewers independently, then collaboratively, synthesized and interpreted data through an inductive and iterative process to derive emergent themes across the included data. External validity checking was undertaken by an expert clinical researcher and for relevant content, a health policy expert. Themes were subsequently subjected to a meta-synthesis, with findings compared and contrasted between user groups and policy and practice recommendations derived. Results: Twelve studies met our inclusion criteria. Among studies of end users (N=7), mHealth technologies supported the management of young people with diabetes, cancer, and asthma. Implementer studies (N=5) covered the management of cognitive and communicative disabilities, asthma, chronic self-harm, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Quality ratings were higher for implementer compared with end user studies. Both complementary and unique user themes emerged. Themes derived for end users of mHealth included (1) Experiences of functionality that supported self-management, (2) Acceptance (technical usability and feasibility), (3) Importance of codesign, and (4) Perceptions of benefit (self-efficacy and empowerment). For implementers, derived themes included (1) Characteristics that supported self-management (functional, technical, and behavior change); (2) Implementation challenges (systems level, service delivery level, and clinical level); (3) Adoption considerations for specific populations (training end users; specific design requirements); and (4) Codesign and tailoring to facilitate uptake and person-centered care. Conclusions: Synthesizing available data revealed both complementary and unique user perspectives on enablers and barriers to designing, developing, and implementing mHealth technologies to support young people's management of their chronic NCDs.";"[Slater, Helen; Briggs, Andrew M.] Curtin Univ, Sch Physiotherapy & Exercise Sci, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Campbell, Jared M.] Univ Adelaide, Fac Hlth Sci, Joanna Briggs Inst, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Stinson, Jennifer N.] Univ Toronto, Lawrence S Bloomberg Fac Nursing, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Stinson, Jennifer N.] Hosp Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Burley, Megan M.] Govt Western Australia, Hlth Networks, Dept Hlth, Perth, WA, Australia";Slater, H (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Physiotherapy & Exercise Sci, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.;h.slater@curtin.edu.au;;"Slater, Helen/0000-0002-4868-4988; Campbell, Jared/0000-0003-0163-4251";"MOVE: muscle, bone and joint health and Arthritis and Osteoporosis Western Australia; School of Physiotherapy and Exercise Science, Curtin University; NHMRC TRIP FellowshipNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [1132548]";This research was supported by grant cofunding awarded from MOVE: muscle, bone and joint health and Arthritis and Osteoporosis Western Australia, with in kind support from the School of Physiotherapy and Exercise Science, Curtin University.

In this paper we pursue the integration of multiple disease-specific Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) in order to manage co-morbidities within a computerized Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS). We present a CPG integration framework-termed as COMET (Comorbidity Ontological Modeling & ExecuTion) that manifests a knowledge management approach to model, computerize and integrate multiple CPG to yield a comorbid CPG knowledge model that upon execution can provide evidence-based recommendations for handling comorbid patients. COMET exploits semantic web technologies to achieve (a) CPG knowledge synthesis to translate a paper-based CPG to disease-specific clinical pathways (CP) that include specialized co-morbidity management procedures based on input from domain experts; (b) CPG knowledge modeling to computerize the disease-specific CP using a Comorbidity CPG ontology; (c) CPG knowledge integration by aligning multiple ontologically-modeled CP to develop a unified comorbid CPG knowledge model; and (e) CPG knowledge execution using reasoning engines to derive CPG-mediated recommendations for managing patients with comorbidities.

The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation convened a meeting of 45 experts to arrive at guiding principles for measurement, create a starter measurement set, specify a proposed definition of the denominator and its refinement, and identify research priorities for future implementation of the accountability system. A series of articles written by experts provided the basis for debate and guidance in formulating a path forward to develop an accountability system for community-based programs for the seriously ill, outlined in this article.

The most common type of anomalies in architectural concrete surfaces, their probable causes, adequate diagnosis methods, and suitable maintenance and repair techniques are studied via quantitative indicators, including correlations, in the application of the procedures and classifications from an inspection, diagnosis, and repair expert system for architectural concrete surfaces. The structural integrity of concrete elements is out of this paper's scope. The results show the importance of a complete set of construction details, including the formwork specifications, which are essential for the surfaces' quality. Related to two-thirds of the registered causes of anomalies, execution is a key stage, greatly benefiting from the use of specialized labor. Regular cleaning procedures and the enhancement of surface protection throughout the surface service life may also prevent a number of relevant anomalies, as the most frequent anomalies (approximately half the occurrences) are aesthetic.

This work aimed at identifying the optimal spray-drying condition(s) to prepare nCmP with specific drug delivery properties including small aerodynamic diameter, effective nanoparticle (NP) redispersion upon nCmP exposure to an aqueous solution, high drug loading, and low water content. Acetalated dextran (Ac-Dex) was used to form NPs, curcumin was used as a model drug, and mannitol was the excipient in the nCmP formulation. Box-Behnken design was applied using Design Expert software for nCmP parameter optimization. NP ratio (NP%) and feed concentration (Fc) are significant parameters that affect the aerodynamic diameters of nCmP systems. NP% is also a significant parameter that affects the drug loading. Fc is the only parameter that influenced the water content of the particles significantly. All nCmP systems could be completely redispersed into the parent NPs, indicating that none of the factors have an influence on this property within the design range. The optimal spray-drying condition to prepare nCmP with a small aerodynamic diameter, redispersion of the NPs, low water content, and high drug loading is 80% NP%, 0.5% Fc, and an inlet temperature lower than 130 degrees C.

Methods: A decision analytic model from the health care system perspective for 60-year-old patients with symptoms secondary to a suspected FTST tear was used to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of 3 imaging strategies during a 2-year time horizon: MRI, ultrasound, and ultrasound followed by MRI. Comprehensive literature search and expert opinion provided data on cost, probability, and quality of life estimates. The primary effectiveness outcome was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) through 2 years, with a willingness-to-pay threshold set to $100,000/QALY gained (2016 U.S. dollars). Costs and health benefits were discounted at 3%. Results: Ultrasound was the least costly strategy ($1385). MRI was the most effective (1.332 QALYs). Ultrasound was the most cost-effective strategy but was not dominant. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for MRI was $22,756/QALY gained, below the willingness-to-pay threshold. Two-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that MRI was favored over the other imaging strategies over a wide range of reasonable costs. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, MRI was the preferred imaging strategy in 78% of the simulations. Conclusion: MRI and ultrasound represent cost-effective imaging options for evaluation of the patient thought to have a symptomatic FTST tear. The results indicate that MRI is the preferred strategy based on cost-effectiveness criteria, although the decision between MRI and ultrasound for an imaging center is likely to be dependent on additional factors, such as available resources and workflow.

Much of the current literature relies on expert-led and top-down processes to investigate connections between landscapes' different land covers and ES. Little is known regarding the preferences of residents, and how they connect land covers with the delivery of ES important for their well-being. The aim of this study is to identify and locate such land cover types as GI that provide multiple ES important for human well-being in rural settings. First, we interviewed 400 urban and rural residents to identify ES important for personal well-being and the land covers that deliver multiple ES in three counties that best represent the existing rural-urban gradient in Sweden. Second, to support the inclusion of GI in spatial planning, we identified and located spatial concentrations of individual land covers providing multiple ES (GI hubs) and significant clusters of such land covers (GI hotspots).

Controversy exists as to whether pregnancy is a risk factor for worse outcomes in BP, and whether such outcomes are the result of factors intrinsic to pregnancy or the tendency to withhold medical therapy in this cohort. MethodsLong-term facial function outcomes in cases of pregnancy-associated BP (PABP) were compared against outcomes in cases affecting nonpregnant adult women of child-bearing age by a blinded expert using the electronic clinician-graded facial function scale (eFACE) facial grading system. ResultsFifty-one pregnancy-associated cases and 58 nonpregnancy-associated cases were included. Among patients who received early corticosteroid therapy, significantly worse static, synkinesis, and composite facial function eFACE scores were demonstrated among cases of PABP compared to nonpregnancy-associated cases (static median = 86 vs. 92.5, P = 0.005; synkinesis median = 79 vs. 86, P = 0.007; composite median = 78 vs. 84, P = 0.023). Among those not treated with corticosteroids, significantly worse dynamic and composite facial function eFACE scores were demonstrated in cases of PABP compared to those for nonpregnancy-associated cases (dynamic median = 74 vs. 92.5, P = 0.038; composite median = 73 vs. 86.5, P = 0.038). A trend toward improved outcomes was demonstrated within both groups for those treated with corticosteroids compared to those who were not. ConclusionIn comparison to cases unrelated to pregnancy, late-term PABP is associated with worse long-term outcomes to a degree that cannot solely be explained by differences in medical therapy.

However, there have only been few studies that provide a comparative performance evaluation of different systems on a common database. We have therefore set up the LUNA16 challenge, an objective evaluation framework for automatic nodule detection algorithms using the largest publicly available reference database of chest CT scans, the LIDC-IDRI data set. In LUNA16, participants develop their algorithm and upload their predictions on 888 CT scans in one of the two tracks: 1) the complete nodule detection track where a complete CAD system should be developed, or 2) the false positive reduction track where a provided set of nodule candidates should be classified. This paper describes the setup of LUNA16 and presents the results of the challenge so far. Moreover, the impact of combining individual systems on the detection performance was also investigated. It was observed that the leading solutions employed convolutional networks and used the provided set of nodule candidates. The combination of these solutions achieved an excellent sensitivity of over 95% at fewer than 1.0 false positives per scan. This highlights the potential of combining algorithms to improve the detection performance. Our observer study with four expert readers has shown that the best system detects nodules that were missed by expert readers who originally annotated the LIDC-IDRI data. We released this set of additional nodules for further development of CAD systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We comparatively investigated the spatial calibration process for front-end endoscopy and redefined the accuracy level of a calibrated endoscope by using a calibration tool with improved structural reliability. We also studied how registration accuracy was combined with the number and distribution of the deployed fiducial points (FPs) for positioning and the measured registration time. A physically integrated ARNES prototype was customarily configured for performance evaluation in skull base tumor resection surgery with an innovative approach of dynamic endoscopic vision expansion. As advised by surgical experts in otolaryngology, we proposed a hierarchical rendering scheme to properly adapt the fused images with the required visual sensation. By constraining the rendered sight in a known depth and radius, the visual focus of the surgeon can be induced only on the anticipated critical anatomies and vessel structures to avoid misguidance. Furthermore, error analysis was conducted to examine the feasibility of hybrid optical tracking based on point cloud, which was proposed in our previous work as an in-surgery registration solution. Measured results indicated that the error of target registration for ARNES can be reduced to 0.77 +/- 0.07 mm. For initial registration, our results suggest that a trade-off for a new minimal time of registration can be reached when the distribution of five FPs is considered. For in-surgery registration, our findings reveal that the intrinsic registration error is a major cause of performance loss. Rigid model and cadaver experiments confirmed that the scenic integration and display fluency of ARNES are smooth, as demonstrated by three clinical trials that surpassed practicality.

The success of such applications lies on several factors like user-friendliness and data presentation as well as the amount and accuracy of cultural data they can offer to users, static or mobile, on-demand. This paper presents the design and implementation of a multipurpose, multidiscipline digital platform that manages, preserves and disseminates tangible and intangible cultural heritage information, in a trustworthy manner, appropriate for the everyday use in smart city digital environments. Platform's trustworthiness is mainly ensured by applying specific authorization mechanisms based on an extended role-based access control scheme. The platform integrates a mobile services module that can host and support smartphone applications for the direct collection, digitization and dissemination of cultural heritage content. Moreover, we make an attempt to address various stakeholders who benefit from such a platform. In this direction we have designed and implemented a series of real life usage scenarios. The proposed platform is evaluated against other online digital platforms that host cultural heritage content. Evaluation results suggest that the presented platform could become a participatory system that targets not only experts and artists, but also amateurs and enthusiasts of cultural heritage. This vast and heterogeneous user base could be the only feasible way to support data-hungry ecosystems like smart city digital environments, by providing cultural information at any time and place.;"[Koukopoulos, Zois; Koukopoulos, Dimitrios] Univ Patras, Dept Cultural Heritage Management & New Technol, 2 G Seferi, Agrinion 30100, Greece; [Jung, Jason J.] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Seoul, South Korea";Koukopoulos, Z (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Dept Cultural Heritage Management & New Technol, 2 G Seferi, Agrinion 30100, Greece.;"zkoukopu@upatras.gr; dkoukopoulos@upatras.gr; j2jung@gmail.com";Jung, Jason J./B-9622-2012;Jung, Jason J./0000-0003-0050-7445;;;;68;9;9;13;67;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1380-7501;1573-7721;;MULTIMED TOOLS APPL;Multimed.

More recently, the microbiota has emerged as a key player in the control of this axis, especially during conditions of stress provoked by real or perceived homeostatic challenge. Diet is one of the most important modifying factors of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The routes of communication between the microbiota and brain are slowly being unravelled, and include the vagus nerve, gut hormone signaling, the immune system, tryptophan metabolism, and microbial metabolites such as short chain fatty acids. The importance of the early life gut microbiota in shaping later health outcomes also is emerging. Results from preclinical studies indicate that alterations of the early microbial composition by way of antibiotic exposure, lack of breastfeeding, birth by Caesarean section, infection, stress exposure, and other environmental influences - coupled with the influence of host genetics - can result in long-term modulation of stress-related physiology and behaviour. The gut microbiota has been implicated in a variety of stressrelated conditions including anxiety, depression and irritable bowel syndrome, although this is largely based on animal studies or correlative analysis in patient populations. Additional research in humans is sorely needed to reveal the relative impact and causal contribution of the microbiome to stress-related disorders. In this regard, the concept of psychobiotics is being developed and refined to encompass methods of targeting the microbiota in order to positively impact mental health outcomes. At the 2016 Neurobiology of Stress Workshop in Newport Beach, CA, a group of experts presented the symposium The Microbiome: Development, Stress, and Disease. This report summarizes and builds upon some of the key concepts in that symposium within the context of how microbiota might influence the neurobiology of stress. (c) 2017 The Authors.

The results were discussed with an international group of experts to develop a consensus on the role of HRM in GERD. A proposed classification system for esophageal motor abnormalities associated with GERD was generated. Key ResultsPhysiologic gastro-esophageal reflux is inherent in all humans, resulting from transient lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxations that allow venting of gastric air in the form of a belch. In pathological gastro-esophageal reflux, transient LES relaxations are accompanied by reflux of gastric contents. Structural disruption of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) barrier, and incomplete clearance of the refluxate can contribute to abnormally high esophageal reflux burden that defines GERD. Esophageal HRM localizes the LES for pH and pH-impedance probe placement, and assesses esophageal body peristaltic performance prior to invasive antireflux therapies and antireflux surgery. Furthermore, HRM can assess EGJ and esophageal body mechanisms contributing to reflux, and exclude conditions that mimic GERD. Conclusions & InferencesStructural and motor EGJ and esophageal processes contribute to the pathophysiology of GERD. A classification scheme is proposed incorporating EGJ and esophageal motor findings, and contraction reserve on provocative tests during HRM.;"[Gyawali, C.

This is considered to be the turning point where the educational system needs to find adequate answers to the whole range of problems of formal education system. Therefore, introducing interdisciplinary thinking for the purpose of offering concrete solutions to the demands of places, users, local community, as well as needs of architecture as a cultural product, appears a necessity. The fundamental problem for education in architecture begins with the question - how to connect the current educational process and architectural practice in order to improve the profession itself? Forming a studio was one of first solutions we wanted to implement. But the formulations of studios shall focus on discussions of studio-based design learning systems and curriculum developments on integral design studios that aim significant and innovative frameworks. In this context, integrated design studios are the newest approaches to architectural education. In this education system, every studio has its own integral course. Integral courses give support to the design studios. This support can be either theoretical or practical. The support of the integral courses to studios must be evaluated deeply. This paper presents the positive and negative aspects of the new integral studio approach in this context. The specific studio, which tends to improve the former one, is based on an integrated approach to design process. It implies an active interaction between theory and practice through cooperation on multiple levels, such as - academic staff, students, experts from practice, experts from institutions responsible for the planning and city development and future inhabitants. The important segment of the newly-introduced methodological concept is insisting upon critical, objective evaluation on every stage of design. Case Study: Issues of the family house modernity in Bosnia and Herzegovina A family house is both the most represented typology of residential space and most referent area of dealing with ( this) new social reality. Therefore, the Studio methodology is based on the basic tendency towards the integration of theory and practice through the work on specific locations in the city and in cooperation with relevant planning institutions.;"[Ugljen-Ademovic, Nina; Ibrisimbegovic, Senka] Univ Sarajevo, Fac Architecture, UNSA, AFS,Dept Architectural Design, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg";Ugljen-Ademovic, N (corresponding author), Univ Sarajevo, Fac Architecture, UNSA, AFS,Dept Architectural Design, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg.;"nnug5@bih.net.ba; senkaibrisimbegovic@gmail.com";;;;;;9;0;0;3;12;GET IT PUBLISHED VERLAG E K;ERLANGEN;ALLEE AM ROETHELHEIMPARK 14, ERLANGEN, 91052, GERMANY;2198-7688;;;NEW ARCH;New Arch;DEC;2017;4;3;;;;;32;38;;10.14621/tna.20170304;;;7;Architecture;Architecture;FR5UR;WOS:000419132200004;;;;;2021-02-18;

Methods and results: Eudravigilance, WHO-Vigibase (as of Feb 25, 2017) and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS, from 2004 to 2016 second quarter) were queried to extract AEs recording SGLT2-Is as suspect. Disproportionality analyses (case/non-case method) were performed in FAERS by calculating the reporting odds ratios (RORs) from System Organ Classes (SOCs) to Preferred Terms (PTs) (precise clinical entities). Potential signals were defined by statistically-significant ROR (lower limit of the 95% confidence interval - LL95% CI - > 1) undetected by literature analysis (as of December 2016). SGLT2-Is were recorded in 7972, 19,775, 11,137 reports (Eudravigilance, WHO-Vigibase and FAERS, respectively); in FAERS, statistically significant ROR emerged for the following SOCs: infections and infestations (N = 2162; LL95% CI = 3.25), metabolism and nutrition disorders (2278; 1.36), renal and urinary disorders (1665; 2.31),  reproductive system and breast disorders (471; 4.85), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (1136; 1.52). Skin toxicity emerged as potential signal (e.g., rash, photosensitivity, urticaria as PTs), both for SGLT2-Is as a class and as individual drugs. Severe adverse skin events (81 reports, 7% of the skin cases) mainly occurred in females aged 18-65 using SGLT2-Is as single antidiabetic regimen. Conclusion: Among antidiabetics, SGLT2-Is are associated with higher reporting of infections, metabolism, renal and reproductive AEs, corroborating clinical trial evidence. Their large reporting patterns and the unexpected signal of skin toxicity justify active vigilance by clinicians and real-time monitoring by pharmacovigilance experts.

Implementing new educational standards and a multistage system of training of specialists at the higher school meant, inter alia, reconsideration of approaches to assessment of student's learning quality. Nevertheless, development of organizational-methodical tools and content of control procedures in most higher education institutions is still focused on a traditional formative (spot), local knowledge assessment. It is obvious that changed economic, social and educational conditions of professionalization (mastering a certain profession and self-realization in it) require a search for more adequate new means and measurement methods of education results got by students. According to the authors of the present article, development of a digital information system of control is necessary. Such a digital information system of control has to take into account the features of educational process of concrete higher education institution; then, continuous accumulation and analysis of all types and forms of personal certification and assessment of educational activity of each student. The aim of the publication is the development of an automated software system for quality education assessments, taking into account the use of Avatar technology. Methodology and research methods. The methods involve: analytical review of scientific-methodological literature and documentation on the organization of assessment of quality education assessments in higher education institutions; analysis and synthesis of experience of application of the techniques developed on the basis of the balanced system estimated indicators (BSC), ISO standards, the EFQM Excellence Model, CIPP evaluation model, international quality standards ESG ENQA, TQM, CATS, etc. System and activity approaches were adopted as methodological base when creating automated program system. Results and scientific novelty. A block diagram of the learning process is presented; it demonstrates organization and management of the learning process in a higher educational institution. The factors that affect the level of student knowledge obtained during training are shown. On this basis, the determining factors in assessing the level of knowledge are highlighted. It is offered to build the managing of individual training at any time interval on the basis of a calculation of the generalized criterion which consists of student's current progress, their activity and time spent for training. The block structure of the automated program system of continuous monitoring of achievements of each student is described. All functional blocks of system are interconnected with educational process. The main advantage of this system is that students have continuous access to materials about own individual achievements and mistakes; from passive consumers of information they turn into active members of the education, and thus, they can achieve bigger effectiveness of personal vocational training. It is pointed out that information base of such system has to be available not only to students and teachers, but also future employers of university graduates. Practical significance. The concept of automated system for education results monitoring and technique of processing of collected material presented in the article are based on a simple and obvious circumstance: a student with high progress spends more time on training and leads active lifestyle in comparison with fellow students; therefore, that student with high probability will be more successful in the chosen profession. Thus, for ease of use, complete, fully detailed and digitized information on individual educational achievements of future expert is necessary not only for effective management of educational process in higher education institutions, but also for employers interested in well-prepared, qualified and hard-working staff intended to take responsibility for labour duties.";"[Kataev, Mikhail Yu.; Korikov, Anatoly M.] Natl Res Tomsk Polytech Univ, Tomsk State Univ Control Syst & Radioelect, Tomsk, Russia; [Mkrtchian, Vardan S.] Internet Univ Management & Informat & Commun Tech, Sydney, NSW, Australia";Kataev, MY (corresponding author), Natl Res Tomsk Polytech Univ, Tomsk State Univ Control Syst & Radioelect, Tomsk, Russia.;"kmy@asu.tusur.ru; korikov@asu.tusur.ru; thhhiversity@hotmail.com";"Kataev, Mikhail Yurievich/G-9652-2017; Mkrttchian, Vardan/N-6230-2016";Mkrttchian, Vardan/0000-0003-4871-5956;;;;18;2;2;0;6;RUSSIAN STATE VOCATIONAL PEDAGOGICAL UNIV;YEKATERINBURG;UL LUNACHARSKOGO, 85A, OFIS 203, YEKATERINBURG, 620075, RUSSIA;1994-5639;2310-5828;;OBRAZOVANIE NAUKA;Obrazov.

The CAD system is designed based on a mixture ensemble of convolutional neural networks (ME-CNN) to discriminate between benign and malignant breast tumors. The ME-CNN is a modular and image-based ensemble, which can stochastically partition the high dimensional image space through simultaneous and competitive learning of its modules. The proposed system was assessed on our database of 112 DCE-MRI studies including solid breast masses, using a wide range of classification measures. The ME-CNN model composed of three CNN experts and one convolutional gating network achieves an accuracy of 96.39%, a sensitivity of 97.73% and a specificity of 94.87%. The experimental results also show that it has competitive classification performances compared to three existing single-classifier methods and two convolutional ensemble methods. The proposed ME CNN model could provide an effective tool for radiologists to analyse breast DCE-MRI images. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These projects are associated with the development of key zones in the Arctic and involve the exploration for and production of minerals (diamonds, gold, rare-earth metals, oil, and gas) and the development of energy and infrastructure (e.g., the Northern Sea Route). Such projects, which are often carried out in territories of traditional nature management belonging to the indigenous peoples of the North, must consider their environmental and social responsibility and the preservation of the ethnic identity and culture of indigenous peoples. The extraction of mineral deposits in the Arctic and the Far North places new demands on subsoil users, related to the preservation and development of the socio-cultural environment of the indigenous peoples of the North and to the ecological rehabilitation of the area. This article presents economic and mathematical models for selecting the optimal development project options based on the pairwise comparison of investment projects and the evaluation of indigenous peoples' preferences. We investigated the investment projects' impact on traditional territories in the Arctic, including the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), in terms of socioeconomic and ethnological development, and environmental change. The suggested system of models can be used to assess the priority of projects supporting and developing the region in the mining corporation's area of responsibility. The proposed models are based on fuzzy set theory, which provides an effective assessment of the population's preferences for projects. Data are processed using the hierarchy analysis method and multivariate optimization calculations to determine the project sets at different funding levels. The creation of information-linked processing models is innovative. Indigenous people's expert assessments of the priority of projects are processed using the hierarchy analysis method to determine the coefficients of the optimization model that enables the calculation of the choice between the analyzed projects, given the allocated financial resources. This approach can be used to address issues of support for indigenous people in areas where mining and other economic development activities are taking place, especially in the Arctic region. The proposed decision-making mechanism, which includes public hearings, sociological surveys, ethnological expertise, and compensation payments to indigenous minorities of the North, facilitates the justification of optimal strategies for maintaining and developing the region, taking into account economic, ecological, social, and ethnological factors.;"[Novoselov, A.; Potravny, I.; Novoselova, I.] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, 36 Stremianniy Per, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Gassiy, V.] Kuban State Univ, 149 Stavroposkaya, Krasnodar 350040, Russia";Gassiy, V (corresponding author), Kuban State Univ, 149 Stavroposkaya, Krasnodar 350040, Russia.;vgassiy@mail.ru;"Potravny, Ivan/ABB-3546-2020; Gassiy, Violetta/N-4182-2019; Novoselov, Andrey/A-9675-2017; Gassiy, Violetta/R-2822-2016; Novoselova, IRINA Yu./A-9645-2017";"Gassiy, Violetta/0000-0002-9453-5692; Novoselov, Andrey/0000-0003-1495-4836; Gassiy, Violetta/0000-0002-9453-5692; Novoselova, IRINA Yu./0000-0002-5054-0676";"Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [14-38-00009]; Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [N 17-02-18003, N 17-02-00214]";This research was supported by a Russian Science Foundation grant (Research project. 14-38-00009 Management by Objectives of the Comprehensive Development of the Arctic Area of the Russian Federation) and by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) (Projects N 17-02-18003 and N 17-02-00214).;;27;13;16;1;25;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;1873-9652;1876-4428;;POLAR SCI;Polar Sci.;DEC;2017;14;;;;;;68;77;;10.1016/j.polar.2017.10.003;;;10;"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary";"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology";FO7HG;WOS:000417043600008;;Bronze;;;2021-02-18;

Blast furnace operation parameters such as coke-to-ore ratio, wall pressures and temperatures, flame temperature, top gas pressure, temperature and composition, hot blast pressure and temperature, sounding levels, etc. and also the level of hot liquid metal and slag in the bottom of furnace, influence the permeability phenomenon directly. Hence, fluctuations and instantenous variations of permeability index parameter should be avoided by controlling inadequate drainage cycles and operational factors to achieve more efficient and stable operation in the furnaces. In this study, permeability index parameter of the Erdemir Blast Furnace #1, located in Turkey, is modeled and experimental computing work is carried out to assess the operation performance of the furnace, depending on selected input parameters. The demanding artificial intelligence and soft computing techniques, artificial neural networks and adaptive neural fuzzy inference system, and a well-known statistical tool, autoregressive integrated moving average model are executed throughout the study using previous furnace data, received during one day of operation. Selected performance measures, coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean squared error, are used to compare the forecasting accuracy of proposed models.

This article presents an analysis of the contributions of Mexican scholars to the analysis of SS. First, we review the basic concepts of socioecological systems, resilience, vulnerability and ecosystem services in the context of SS. Second, we analyze the theoretical-conceptual contributions of Mexican scientists to these issues. Third, we describe some outstanding case studies of the SS integrative perspective. Fourth, we quantitatively explore the contribution of Mexican scholars in publications on SS, resilience and sustainability. Fifth, we assess the undergraduate and postgraduate educational programs on these topics in Mexico. Sixth, we describe how these approaches have permeated decision-making. Finally, we analyze knowledge gaps, challenges and perspectives, identifying the important advances in SS, resilience and vulnerability in the country. We consider critical to understand the challenges related to the stability of the systems, the scientific certainty and the existence of expert decision makers as well as the development of more resilient and less vulnerable SS.

The suggested items were elaborated from terms used in current national and international guidelines and classifications and in part integrated into superordinate terms. The items that were built up by this approach aim to reflect the broad spectrum of pain diseases. The items for the description of pain-associated symptoms and signs are divided into the areas of algesiomotor, psychoalgesiological and somatoalgesiological findings. The aim is the documentation of a multidimensional algesiological description of findings with defined terminology, which can serve as a comparable and unified standard, particularly in the field of pain assessment. The AMDS system should enable a systematic description of pain, which is a reliable foundation for diagnostics, therapy planning and expert case evaluation.;"[Gromer, Teja W.; Kaefferlein, Wolfgang] Praxisklin Dres Kafferlein Gromer & Kollegen, Heinrichsdamm 6, D-96047 Bamberg, Germany; [Gromer, Teja W.; Kornhuber, Johannes; Mueller, Helge H.

J;Spiller, M;;;;Spiller, Marc;;;Measuring adaptive capacity of urban wastewater infrastructure - Change impact and change propagation;SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Change propagation; Change impact; System; Transformation; Wastewater; Indicator";"SYSTEMS; SUSTAINABILITY; INDICATORS; DESIGN; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; DYNAMICS; RECOVERY; SLUDGE";The ability of urban wastewater systems to adapt and transform as a response to change is an integral part of sustainable development. This requires technology and infrastructure that can be adapted to new operational challenges. In this study the adaptive capacity of urban wastewater systems is evaluated by assessing the interdependencies between system components. In interdependent and therefore tightly coupled systems, changes to one systems component will require alteration elsewhere in the system, therefore impairing the capacity of these systems to be changed. The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology to evaluate the adaptive capacity of urban wastewater systems by assessing how change drivers and innovation affect existing wastewater technology and infrastructure. The methodology comprises 7 steps and applies a change impact table and a design structure matrix that are completed by experts during workshops. Change impact tables quantify where change drivers, such as energy neutrality and resource recovery, require innovation in a system. The design structure matrix is a tool to quantify emerging changes that are a result of the innovation. The method is applied for the change driver of energy neutrality and shown for two innovations: a decentralised upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor followed by an anammox process and a conventional activated sludge treatment with enhanced chemical precipitation and high temperature-high pressure hydrolysis. The results show that the energy neutrality of wastewater systems can be address by either innovation in the decentralised or centralised treatment. The quantification of the emerging changes for both innovations indicates that the decentralised treatment is more disruptive, or in other words, the system needs to undergo more adaptation. It is concluded that the change impact and change propagation method can be used to characterise and quantify the technological or infrastructural transformations. In addition, it provides insight into the stakeholders affected by change. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The design of a fuzzy controller does not require a complicated mathematical model. It only requires a set of rules to form the rule table. Basically all of the rules in the rule table are based on the expert's experience which actually comes from his/her understanding operation of the system. In particular, fuzzy logic controller can be used to control for a nonlinear systems, using rules rather than mathematical model. The sugeno fuzzy inference method provides a more systematic approach to the design of fuzzy logic controller. It works better dynamic performance in multi-state variables (three or more variables). In this study, the aim of control system for the four state variables (angular position of inverted pendulum, angular velocity of inverted pendulum, cart position and cart velocity) is to simultaneously balance the inverted pendulum and place the cart in a desired position with fuzzy logic controller that contains sugeno inference method.;"[Gani, Ahmet; Kececioglu, O.

However, in spite of many successful technology demonstrations, commercial adoption has been slow, presumably because the threshold for value versus cost and technology risk has not yet been crossed. One likely path for disruptive superconducting technology in commercial products could be in applications where its advantages become key enablers for systems which are not practical with conventional technology. To help systems engineers assess the viability of such future solutions, we present a technology roadmap for superconducting machines.

Twenty-three persons with cancer (19 women and 4 men, age 18-43, 1-5 years post-diagnosis of lymphoma, breast, gynecologic, central nervous system, or testicular cancer) were recruited to test a 2-month web-based program targeting sexual problems or fertility distress. The programs were organized in modules with educational and behavior change content, including texts, illustrations, exercises, and video vignettes. The program also included a discussion forum and an ask the expert forum. In addition, the sexuality program offered two telephone consultations. Feasibility (regarding demand, acceptability, preliminary efficacy, and functionality) was evaluated with the website system data, telephone interviews, continuous online evaluations, and study-specific measures. Fifteen participants completed four modules or more. Most of the program features were used and well accepted by these committed users. The web-based format enabled flexible use by participants with diverse needs. Preliminary efficacy was indicated by self-reported increased knowledge and skill in handling sexual problems and fertility distress. The website was easy to use and functioned well technically. The present study indicated that this web-based intervention was feasible for adolescents and young adults with cancer. The effectiveness of the intervention in decreasing sexual problems and fertility distress will be tested in a population-based randomized controlled trial for adolescents and young adults with cancer.

We evaluated three current classification systems, including traditional Major/Minor Classification, Complexity Classification, and the Difficulty Scoring System for predicting the surgical outcomes after LLR. We reviewed the clinical data of 301 patients who underwent LLR for hepatocellular carcinoma between March 1, 2004 and June 30, 2015. We compared the intraoperative, pathologic, and postoperative outcomes according to the three classifications. We also compared the prognostic value of the three classifications using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The Major/Minor Classification, Complexity Classification, and the Difficulty Scoring System efficiently differentiated surgical difficulty in terms of blood loss (P = 0.001, P = 0.009, and P < 0.001, respectively) and operation time (all P < 0.001). Regarding intraoperative outcomes, the Difficulty Scoring System and Complexity Classification successfully differentiated the transfusion rate (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). However, only the Complexity Classification adequately predicted severe postoperative complications (P = 0.032), the severity of complications (P < 0.001), and the length of hospital stay (P = 0.005). In ROC curve analysis, the Complexity Classification (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.611) outperformed the Major/Minor Classification (AUC = 0.544) and the Difficulty Scoring System (AUC = 0.530) for predicting severe postoperative complications. None of the classification systems predicted recurrence or patient survival. The Complexity Classification was superior to the other methods for assessing surgical difficulty and predicting complications after LLR for hepatocellular carcinoma.;"[Periyasamy, Mohan; Cho, Jai Young; Han, Ho-Seong; Yoon, Yoo-Seok; Choi, YoungRok; Jang, Jae Seong; Kwon, Seong Uk; Kim, Sungho; Choi, Jang Kyu; Guro, Hanisah] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Surg, Bundang Hosp, 300 Gumi Dong, Seongnam Si 463707, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Periyasamy, Mohan] Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Med Univ, Dept Surg, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Ahn, Soyeon] Seoul Natl Univ, Med Res Collaborating Ctr, Bundang Hosp, Seongnam Si, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Guro, Hanisah] Amai Pakpak Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Marawi, Philippines";Cho, JY (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Surg, Bundang Hosp, 300 Gumi Dong, Seongnam Si 463707, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.;jychogs@gmail.com;"Yoon, Yoo-Seok/AAD-4820-2020; Choi, YoungRok/D-5532-2012";"Yoon, Yoo-Seok/0000-0001-7621-8557; Choi, YoungRok/0000-0003-2408-7086; Cho, Jai Young/0000-0002-1376-956X";;;;22;5;6;0;2;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0930-2794;1432-2218;;SURG ENDOSC;Surg.

Numerous NTS rating systems have been developed to support effective training and assessment. Yet despite the additional challenges posed by robotic surgery, no NTS rating systems have been developed for this unique surgical environment. This study reports the development and validation of the first NTS behavioural rating system for robotic surgery. A comprehensive index of all relevant NTS behaviours in robotic surgery was developed through observation of robotic theatre and interviews with robotic surgeons. Using a Delphi methodology, a panel of 16 expert surgeons was consulted to identify behaviours important to NTS assessment. These behaviours were organised into an appropriate assessment template. Experts were consulted on the feasibility, applicability and educational impact of ICARS. An observational trial was used to validate ICARS. 73 novice, intermediate and expert robotic surgeons completed a urethrovesical anastomosis within a simulated operating room. NTS were tested using four scripted scenarios of increasing difficulty. Performances were video recorded. Robotic and NTS experts assessed the videos post hoc using ICARS and the standard behavioural rating system, NOn-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS). 28 key non-technical behaviours were identified by the expert panel. The finalised behavioural rating system was organised into four principle domains and seven categories. Expert opinion strongly supported its implementation. ICARS was found to be equivalent to NOTSS on Bland-Altman analysis and accurately differentiated between novice, intermediate and expert participants, p = 0.01.

This study aims at analyzing the influence of the IIoT on these business models from a business level perspective. In particular, it focuses on the interrelationships between business model component changes. While the sparse body of extant management literature examines just a subset of business model elements as affected by the IIoT, a framework comprising an entire set of elements is provided. Besides, their direct and indirect interrelationships, and the most important changes in each of the elements, are investigated. For this purpose, an exploratory multiple case study approach is employed, which is based on relevant IIoT-related experiences of 76 German manufacturing companies. By triangulating data from semi-structured expert interviews and archival company material, the study provides in-depth insights and a better understanding of IIoT-driven effects on manufacturing business models. It contributes to extant management literature by revealing the value proposition, internal infrastructure management, and customer relationships predominantly influenced by the IIoT. Moreover, it is shown that IIoT-triggered business model changes are offer-driven, particularly by production and process optimization within customers' production systems. These value proposition changes result in subsequent modifications of the remaining business model elements.;"[Kiel, Daniel; Arnold, Christian; Voigt, Kai-Ingo] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Numberg, Chair Ind Management, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany";Kiel, D (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Numberg, Chair Ind Management, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.;"daniel.kiel@fau.de; christian.arnold@fau.de; kai-ingo.voigt@fau.de";;;;;;77;59;61;18;206;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0166-4972;1879-2383;;TECHNOVATION;Technovation;DEC;2017;68;;;;;;4;19;;10.1016/j.technovation.2017.09.003;;;16;"Engineering, Industrial; Management; Operations Research & Management Science";"Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science";FQ2WA;WOS:000418217500002;;;;;2021-02-18;

Its development requires the investigation of road usage and interactions between traffic commuters. This article is focused on exploiting crowdsourced user-generated data, namely GPS trajectories collected by cyclists and road network infrastructure generated by citizens, to extract and analyze spatial patterns and road-type use of cyclists in urban environments. Since user-generated data shows data-deficiencies, we introduce tailored spatial data-handling processes for which several algorithms are developed and implemented. These include data filtering and segmentation, map-matching and spatial arrangement of GPS trajectories with the road network. A spatial analysis and a characterization of road-type use are then carried out to investigate and identify specific spatial patterns of cycle routes. The proposed analysis was applied to the cities of Amsterdam (The Netherlands) and Osnabruck (Germany), proving its feasibility and reliability in mining road-type use and extracting pattern information and preferences. This information can help users who wish to explore friendlier and more interesting cycle patterns, based on collective usage, as well as city planners and transportation experts wishing to pinpoint areas most in need of further development and planning.;"[Sultan, Jody; Ben-Haim, Gev; Dalyot, Sagi] Technion, Mapping & Geoinformat Engn, Haifa, Israel; [Haunert, Jan-Henrik] Univ Osnabruck, Inst Geoinformat & Remote Sensing, Osnabruck, Germany";Dalyot, S (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Transportat & Geoinformat Engn, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.;dalyot@technion.ac.il;Dalyot, Sagi/AAB-1066-2021;"Dalyot, Sagi/0000-0002-5639-8009; Haunert, Jan-Henrik/0000-0001-8005-943X";;;;31;11;11;1;16;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1361-1682;1467-9671;;T GIS;Trans.

Contemporary graduate nursing students are facing unprecedented challenges to meet rigorous academic standards as they prepare for their advanced professional role to meet the demands of the nation's complex and ever-changing healthcare system. Empowering graduate nursing students to ease their perceived stress and minimize undesirable health effects may benefit their capacity to adapt and successfully manage perceived stress in their future healthcare role. AimsTo conduct a systematic review to evaluate the existing evidence with the aim of identifying evidence-based self-care interventions for coping with perceived stress. MethodsWe conducted a systematic review, searching CINAHL Plus with Full Text, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE. Inclusion criteria included self-care, graduate students, perceived stress as measured by Perceived Stress Scale, quantitative analysis, conducted within the United States, English language, and peer reviewed. Two authors completed an asynchronous review of the articles, and one expert evidence-based practice mentor and one wellness expert conducted rigorous appraisal of the eight identified studies. Evidence was evaluated and synthesized, and recommendations for practice were determined. ResultsEight studies meeting the criteria for this systematic review were critically appraised. The interventions varied from a stress management course to mind-body-stress-reduction (MBSR) techniques, such as yoga, breath work, meditation, and mindfulness. All studies measured the outcome of stress with the Perceived Stress Scale. Each study demonstrated a reduction in perceived stress postintervention. Linking Evidence to ActionMost effective self-care MBSR interventions include (a) a didactic component, (b) a guided MBSR practice session, and (c) homework. Consideration should be given to a trained or certified MBSR instructor to teach the intervention.;"[Stillwell, Susan B.] Univ Portland, Sch Nursing, Grad Educ, Portland, OR 97203 USA; [Vermeesch, Amber L.] Univ Portland, Sch Nursing, Nursing, Portland, OR 97203 USA; [Scott, Jane G.] Univ Portland, Clark Lib, Portland, OR 97203 USA";Stillwell, SB (corresponding author), Univ Portland, Sch Nursing, 5000 North Willamette Blvd, Portland, OR 97203 USA.;stillwel@up.edu;;;;;;40;16;16;2;64;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1545-102X;1741-6787;;WORLDV EVID-BASED NU;Worldviews Evid.-Based Nurs.;DEC;2017;14;6;;;;;507;513;;10.1111/wvn.12250;;;7;Nursing;Nursing;FP3OY;WOS:000417528700011;28795775;;;;2021-02-18;

The task of seismic hazard analysis is to estimate the potential level of ground motion parameters that would be produced by future earthquakes. In this paper, a novel method based on fuzzy logic techniques and probabilistic approach is proposed for seismic hazard analysis (FPSHA). In FPSHA, we employ fuzzy sets for quantification of earthquake magnitude and source-to-site distance, and fuzzy inference rules for ground motion attenuation relationships. The membership functions for earthquake magnitude and source-to-site distance are provided based on expert judgments, and the construction of fuzzy rules for peak ground acceleration relationships is also based on expert judgment. This methodology enables to include aleatory and epistemic uncertainty in the process of seismic hazard analysis. The advantage of the proposed method is in its efficiency, reliability, practicability, and precision. A case study is investigated for seismic hazard analysis of Kunming city in Yunnan Province, People's Republic of China. The results of the proposed fuzzy logic-based model are compared to other models, which confirms the accuracy in predicting the probability of exceeding a certain level of the peak ground acceleration. Further, the results can provide a sound basis for decision making of disaster reduction and prevention in Yunnan province.;"[Andric, Jelena M.; Lu, Da-Gang] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Res Grp Reliabil & Risk Engn RARE, Huanghe Rd 73, Harbin 150090, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China";Andric, JM (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Res Grp Reliabil & Risk Engn RARE, Huanghe Rd 73, Harbin 150090, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.;"jln.andric@gmail.com; ludagang@hit.edu.cn";;;"National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51678209, 51378162, 51178150]; Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2013BAJ08B01]; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory for Disaster Reduction in Civil Engineering [SLDRCE12-MB-04]; Specialized Research fund for the doctoral program of higher educationSpecialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP) [20112302110005]";The financial support received from the National Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51678209, 51378162, 51178150), the Research fund from Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2013BAJ08B01), the Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory for Disaster Reduction in Civil Engineering (SLDRCE12-MB-04), and the Specialized Research fund for the doctoral program of higher education (20112302110005) is gratefully appreciated.;;79;5;5;0;29;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0921-030X;1573-0840;;NAT HAZARDS;Nat.

But it faces the challenge of weights assignment to features to measure similarity between cases. There are many methods to overcome this feature weighting problem of CBR. However, neural network's pruning is one of the powerful and useful methods to overcome this feature weighting problem, which extracts feature weights from trained neural network without losing the generality of training set by four popular mechanisms: sensitivity, activity, saliency and relevance. It is habitually assumed that the training sets used for learning are balanced. However, this hypothesis is not always true in real-world applications, and hence, the tendency is to yield classification models that are biased toward the overrepresented class. Therefore, a hybrid CBR system is proposed in this paper to overcome this problem, which adopts a cost-sensitive back-propagation neural network (BPNN) in network pruning to find feature weights. These weights are used in CBR. A single cost parameter is used by the cost-sensitive BPNN to distinguish the importance of class errors. A balanced decision boundary is generated by the cost parameter using prior information. Thus, the class imbalance problem of network pruning is overcome to improve the accuracy of the hybrid CBR. From the empirical results, it is observed that the performance of the proposed hybrid CBR system is better than the hybrid CBR by standard neural network. The performance of the proposed hybrid system is validated with seven datasets.;"[Biswas, Saroj Kr; Chakraborty, Manomita; Singh, Heisnam Rohen; Devi, Debashree; Purkayastha, Biswajit] NIT Silchar, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, Silchar 788010, Assam, India; [Das, Akhil Kr] Uttar Banga Krishi Viswavidylaya, Fac Technol, Cooch Behar 736165, W Bengal, India";Biswas, SK (corresponding author), NIT Silchar, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, Silchar 788010, Assam, India.;bissarojkum@yahoo.com;;;;;;25;11;12;1;21;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1432-7643;1433-7479;;SOFT COMPUT;Soft Comput.;DEC;2017;21;24;;;;;7579;7596;;10.1007/s00500-016-2312-x;;;18;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications";Computer Science;FM4DH;WOS:000414961100023;;;;;2021-02-18;

Common models, such as the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) model, which grants interaction opportunities to the most agile user, and the static priority model, which gives interaction opportunities to the user with the highest predefined priority, disregard the importance of perceiving equality in interaction (EII) among all users. One exception is the dynamic priority (DP) model, as proposed in our earlier work, which grants interaction opportunities to a user based on the recency of his/her gained opportunities. To date, few research efforts have investigated the effect of interaction models on multiuser satisfaction. This paper hence presents an assessment of the DP model's effect on multiuser satisfaction within a collaborative VE. We first verified that the DP model allowed multiple users to perceive EII. We then conducted an experiment to examine the effect of the DP and FCFS models on multiuser satisfaction under a quasi-practical scenario that mimicked a decision-makingmeeting of experts. The framework of the examination was based on several metrics, which we proposed for the components of the ISO/IEC 25010: 2011 standard. This framework resolved issues with existing metrics that measure user satisfaction by analyzing individual experience, thus omitting EII desired by multiple users. The results of the experiment indicated that the DP model fulfilled the metrics of the framework significantly better than the FCFS model. This observation implies a potential application of the DP model in collaborative VEs where multiuser satisfaction is the key to productive collaboration.;"[Erfanian, Aida; Hu, Yaoping] Univ Calgary, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Schulich Sch Engn, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Zeng, Tao] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Zeng, Tao] Xiamen Univ, Dept Instrumental & Elect Engn, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China";Hu, YP (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Schulich Sch Engn, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.;"aerfania@ucalgary.ca; huy@ucalgary.ca; tao.zeng@xmu.edu.cn";;;Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [STPGP/364847-2008, STPGP 478870];The work of Y.

This study aimed to determine whether the diagnostic accuracy of an ANN-based diagnostic system and conventional quantitation are comparable. Methods The ANN was trained to classify potentially abnormal areas as true or false based on the nuclear cardiology expert interpretation of 1001 gated stress/rest Tc-99m-MIBI images at 12 hospitals. The diagnostic accuracy of the ANN was compared with 364 expert interpretations that served as the gold standard of abnormality for the validation study. Conventional summed stress/rest/difference scores (SSS/SRS/SDS) were calculated and compared with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. Results The ANN generated a better area under the ROC curves (AUC) than SSS (0.92 vs. 0.82, p < 0.0001), indicating better identification of stress defects. The ANN also generated a better AUC than SDS (0.90 vs. 0.75, p < 0.0001) for stress-induced ischemia. The AUC for patients with old myocardial infarction based on rest defects was 0.97 (0.91 for SRS, p = 0.0061), and that for patients with and without a history of revascularization based on stress defects was 0.94 and 0.90 (p = 0.0055 and p < 0.0001 vs. SSS, respectively). The SSS/SRS/SDS steeply increased when ANN values (probability of abnormality) were > 0.80.

We need patient-designed QoC instruments that work across languages and countries to optimise studies across systems in this area. Few QoC measurement tools exist that assess all aspects of QoC from the patient perspective. This paper describes the development and validation of a comprehensive measure to assess patient perceptions of QoC that incorporates technical and interpersonal aspects of care and is grounded in the established Institute of Medicine (IOM) QoC framework. Design We conducted a multi-country cross-sectional study. Methods Following a literature review and patient focus groups, an expert panel generated questionnaire items. Following a pilot study, item numbers were reduced. The final questionnaire consisted of three sections: demographics, perceived QoC and one open-ended question. Data was collected from patients (n = 531) discharged from hospitals across seven countries in South East Europe (languages: Turkish, Greek, Portuguese, Romanian, Croatian, Macedonian and Bulgarian). Reliability and validity of the measure were assessed. Results Confirmatory factor analysis was used to compare various factor models of patient-perceived QoC. Good model fit was demonstrated for a two-factor model: communication and interpersonal care, and hospital facilities. Conclusions The ORCAB (Improving quality and safety in the hospital: The link between organisational culture, burnout and quality of care) Patient QoC questionnaire has been collaboratively and exhaustively developed between healthcare professionals and patients. It enables patient QoC data to be assessed in the context of the IOM pillars of quality, considering both technical and interpersonal dimensions of care. It represents an important first step in including the patient perspective.;"[Villiers-Tuthill, Amanda] Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Dept Psychol, Div Populat Hlth Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Doulougeri, Karolina; Montgomery, Anthony] Univ Macedonia, Dept Educ & Social Policy, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Mcgee, Hannah] Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Panagopoulou, Efharis] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Med Sch, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Morgan, Karen] Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Div Populat Hlth Sci, Dept Psychol, Dublin, Ireland; [Morgan, Karen] Perdana Univ, PU RCSI Sch Med, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia";"Morgan, K (corresponding author), Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Div Populat Hlth Sci, Dept Psychol, Dublin, Ireland.; Morgan, K (corresponding author), Perdana Univ, PU RCSI Sch Med, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.";karenmorgan@perdanauniversity.edu.my;"Montgomery, Anthony/J-6364-2014; McGee, Hannah/D-6480-2012; Morgan, Karen/C-3846-2012";"Montgomery, Anthony/0000-0002-1118-7398; McGee, Hannah/0000-0003-1417-993X; Morgan, Karen/0000-0001-6193-1747; Panagopoulou, Efharis/0000-0001-8708-7361";FP7 European Commission;The ORCAB consortium: from 2009 to 2014, the FP7 European Commission Grant funded the project 'Organisational culture, professional burnout and quality of health care in hospitals (ORCAB)'.

Many countries within the European Union have national landslide inventories to fulfill these demands for their respective research. However, those inventories were usually not intended to provide the technical basis for automated process and risk analyses during their design phase. The ongoing development of Germany's national landslide database offers the opportunity to do this differently. This paper introduces a landslide inventory system called WISL suitable for data handling as well as for novel automated process and risk analyses on a national scale. WISL is designated to form the technical infrastructure for a German national database. Its core consists of an open source relational database management system (PostgreSQL), standardized input and registration methods as well as integrated analyses modules, which avoid large data movement and allow for rapid risk analyses. We present proof-of-concept results of endangered infrastructure related to automated risk mappings based on topography and proximity of active landslides. The use of open source software and the application of a standardized input and data acquisition system for experts, coupled with custom analysis modules, constitutes a step toward automated risk maps by a mere 'button-press'. Future developments for the inventory lie in the field of refining and inventing analysis modules and collecting data, for which WISL provides a firm technical base.;"[Kreuzer, Thomas M.; Damm, Bodo] Univ Vechta, Dept Appl Phys Geog, Vechta, Germany; [Wilde, Martina; Terhorst, Birgit] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Geog & Geol, Wurzburg, Germany";Kreuzer, TM (corresponding author), Univ Vechta, Dept Appl Phys Geog, Vechta, Germany.;"thomas.kreuzer@uni-vechta.de; martina.wilde@uni-wuerzburg.de; birgit.terhorst@uni-wuerzburg.de; bodo.damm@uni-vechta.de";;Kreuzer, Thomas/0000-0002-9459-1221;"German Research Foundation DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Te295/9-1, 9-2, DA 452/5-1]; Lower Saxonian Mininstry for Science MWK [MWK76ZN1504]";We are very grateful for the funding of the German Research Foundation DFG (projects: Te295/9-1 and 9-2, DA 452/5-1) and the Lower Saxonian Mininstry for Science MWK (projects: MWK76ZN1504, 2016-2019 - Niedersachsisches Vorab).

These water supply sources tend to have low water quality levels. Application of water quality determination and purification measures could minimize water-related diseases associated with direct consumption of water with poor quality levels. A number of simple measures have been devised and utilized by indigenous communities based on their resource conservation knowledge to improve water quality levels. However, scientific approaches that are more in tune with modern demands for reliability and exactness are the preferred, mainstream approaches for determining water quality. Growing recognition of the relevance of indigenous knowledge has led to renewed interest in the possibility of utilizing it for such tasks. Research conducted in 2007 and 2008 in two indigenous communities in Ghana revealed a diversity of indigenous methods for water quality determination and purification including straining, settling and use of special seeds which could still be useful in this contemporary era. This paper recommends that knowledge co-production and transdisciplinary approaches be employed to enable indigenous communities and experts to collaborate and develop measures that tap both knowledge systems for improving water quality levels for human use.;[Opare, Service] Univ Canada West, 626 West Pender St, Vancouver, BC V6B 1V9, Canada;Opare, S (corresponding author), Univ Canada West, 626 West Pender St, Vancouver, BC V6B 1V9, Canada.;sopare@ucalgary.ca;;;;;;72;3;3;1;7;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1387-585X;1573-2975;;ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN;Environ.

Although several methods to automatically learn FCMs are recognized from the scientific literature, the most used approach to build an FCM relies on a collaborative task involving single person or, more suitably, group of experts. Collaborative development increases reliability and robustness of the resulting FCM, but rises some problems in terms of group decision making to aggregate different perspectives of the problem representation. This paper proposes to support collaborative development of FCMs introducing knowledge engineering process that relies on Linguistic Fuzzy Consensus Model. In the proposed approach, each expert builds the own version of the FCM. When all different versions are available, a Group Decision Making process is activated in order to reach the consensus on conflictual modeling opinions. The result is a unique final version of the FCM that is not a simple aggregation of the versions provided by the experts but is the result of a well-suited mathematical model. In addition, this work adopts consensus model with incomplete preference relations scheme to address knowledge harmonization issues.

Current methods in SLCA scientific literature consider a standard arbitrary linear score set to translate qualitative performances into a quantitative assessment for all subcategory indicators, i.e., it translate a A, B, C, D scoring into a 4, 3, 2, 1 ordinal scale. This assumption does not cover the complexity of the subcategory indicators in the social life cycle assessment phase. The aim of this paper is to set out a customized scoring and weighting approach for impact assessment in SLCA beyond the assumption of arbitrary linearity and equal weighting. Methods This method overcomes the linearity assumption and develops specific value functions for each subcategory indicator and an approach to establish the weighting factors between the indicators for each social dimension (workers, local community, and society). The value function and weighting factors are based on the considered opinions of SLCA experts in Quebec. Results and discussion The results show that value functions with different shapes used to score the performance of the product within each subcategory indicator influence SLCA results and have the potential to reverse the conclusions. The customized score is more realistic than the linear score because it can better capture the complexity of the subcategory indicators based on SLCA expert judgment. Conclusions Our approach addresses a methodological weakness of the impact assessment phase of SLCA through a more representative performance of the potential social impacts based on the judgment of the SLCA expert rather than a simplified assumption of linearity and equal weighting among indicators.

In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid model that provides disease prediction and medical recommendations to cardiac patients. The first part aims at implementing a prediction model, that can identify the disease of a patient and classify it into one of the four output classes i.e., non-cardiac chest pain, silent ischemia, angina, and myocardial infarction. Following the disease prediction, the second part of the model provides general medical recommendations to patients. Methods: The recommendations are generated by assessing the severity of clinical features of patients, estimating the risk associated with clinical features and disease, and calculating the probability of occurrence of disease. The purpose of this model is to build an intelligent and adaptive recommender system for heart disease patients. The experiments for the proposed recommender system are conducted on a clinical data set collected and labelled in consultation with medical experts from a known hospital. Results: The performance of the proposed prediction model is evaluated using accuracy and kappa statistics as evaluation measures. The medical recommendations are generated based on information collected from a knowledge base created with the help of physicians. The results of the recommendation model are evaluated using confusion matrix and gives an accuracy of 97.8%.

Knowledge Management (KM) through its tools/techniques provides a pertinent framework for decision-making in healthcare systems. The objective of this study was to identify and prioritize the KM tools/techniques that apply to hospital setting. Methods: This is a descriptive-survey study. Data were collected using a -researcher-made questionnaire that was developed based on experts' opinions to select the appropriate tools/techniques from 26 tools/techniques of the Asian Productivity Organization (APO) model. Questions were categorized into five steps of KM (identifying, creating, storing, sharing, and applying the knowledge) according to this model. The study population consisted of middle and senior managers of hospitals and managing directors of Vice-Chancellor for Curative Affairs in Kerman University of Medical Sciences in Kerman, Iran. The data were analyzed in SPSS v.19 using one-sample ttest. Results: Twelve out of 26 tools/techniques of the APO model were identified as the tools applicable in hospitals. Knowledge cafe and APO knowledge management assessment tool with respective means of 4.23 and 3.7 were the most and the least applicable tools in the knowledge identification step. Mentor-mentee scheme, as well as voice and Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) with respective means of 4.20 and 3.52 were the most and the least applicable tools/techniques in the knowledge creation step.  Knowledge cafe and  voice and VOIP with respective means of 3.85 and 3.42 were the most and the least applicable tools/techniques in the knowledge storage step.

Unfortunately, evidence from state and national tests shows that children fail to successfully navigate the reading comprehension challenges they face. Schools have struggled to find approaches that can help children succeed in this important task. Typical instruction in classrooms across the country has focused on procedural application of strategies or content-focused approaches that encourage rich discussions. Both approaches have achieved success but have limitations-related transparency and specificity of scaffolds and guidance for the teacher and learner in today's diverse and complex classroom settings. The text structure strategy combines content and strategy to provide pragmatic, transparent, and scaffolded instruction addressing these challenges. A web-based intelligent tutoring system for the text structure strategy, named ITSS, was designed and developed to provide consistent and high-quality instruction to learners in Grades 4 and 5 about how to read, select main ideas, encode strategic memory structures, make inferences, and monitor comprehension during reading. In this article, we synthesize results from two recent large-scale randomized controlled studies to showcase how the ITSS supports selection and encoding of students' strategic memory structures and how prior knowledge affects the memory structures.

An analysis of practical use from policy to field;LAND USE POLICY;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Soils; Soil functions; Questionnaire; Stakeholders; Non-expert; Data; Improvements";ECOSYSTEM SERVICES;Soils form a major component of the natural system and their functions underpin many key ecosystem goods and services. The fundamental importance of soils in the environment means that many different organisations and stakeholders make extensive use of soils data and information in their everyday working practices. For many reasons, stakeholders are not always aware that they are reliant upon soil data and information to support their activities. Various reviews of stakeholder needs and how soil information could be improved have been carried out in recent years. However, to date, there has been little consideration of user needs from a non-expert perspective. The aim of this study was to explore the use of explicit and hidden soil information in different organisations across Europe and gain a better understanding of improvements needed in soil data and information to assist in practical use by non-expert stakeholders. An on-line questionnaire was used to investigate different uses of soils data and information with 310 responses obtained from 77 organisations across Europe. Results illustrate the widespread use of soil data and information across diverse organisations within Europe, particularly spatial products and soil functional assessments and tools. A wide range of improvements were expressed with a prevalence for finer scale resolution, trends over time, future scenarios, improved accuracy, non-technical supporting information and better capacity to use GIS. An underlying message is that existing legacy soils data need to be supplemented by new up-to-date data to meet stakeholder needs and information gaps.;"[Campbell, G. A.; Lilly, A.; Black, H. I.

It looks even so that our understanding of the role of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and particulate guanylyl cyclase (pGC) in health and disease is in many aspects at the beginning and far from being understood. This holds even true for the therapeutic impact of innovative drugs acting on both the NO/sGC and the pGC pathways. Since cGMP, as second messenger, is involved in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases within the cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and endocrine systems and also plays a role in neuronal, sensory, and tumor processes, drug applications might be quite broad. On the 8th International Conference on cGMP, held in Bamberg, Germany, world leading experts came together to discuss these topics. All aspects of cGMP research from the basic understanding of cGMP signaling to clinical applicability were discussed in depth. In addition, present and future therapeutic applications of cGMP-modulating pharmacotherapy were presented (http://www.cyclicgmp.net/index.html).;"[Friebe, Andreas] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Physiol, Rontgenring 9, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Sandner, Peter] Bayer AG, Drug Discovery, Aprather Weg 18a, D-42096 Wuppertal, Germany; [Sandner, Peter] Hannover Med Sch, Inst Pharmacol, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Schmidtko, Achim] Goethe Univ, Inst Pharmacol, Coll Pharm, Max von Laue Str 9, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany";"Sandner, P (corresponding author), Bayer AG, Drug Discovery, Aprather Weg 18a, D-42096 Wuppertal, Germany.; Sandner, P (corresponding author), Hannover Med Sch, Inst Pharmacol, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.";"andreas.friebe@uni-wuerzburg.de; peter.sandner@bayer.com; schmidtko@em.uni-frankfrut.de";Schmidtko, Achim/AAB-2122-2019;;"Bayer AGBayer AG; MSD; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG); Ironwood; DFG ForschergruppeGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 2060]; Harvard Apparatus; Biomol; PolyGene; DSI; Bio Trend; Bio Log; Immune Diagnostic";The organization of the 8th cGMP meeting 2017 would not have been possible without financial sponsorship of research organizations and companies.

A key requirement for the success and adoption of such systems is that users must trust system choices or even fully automated decisions. To achieve this, explanation facilities have been widely investigated as a means of establishing trust in these systems since the early years of expert systems. With today's increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms, new challenges in the context of explanations, accountability, and trust towards such systems constantly arise. In this work, we systematically review the literature on explanations in advice-giving systems. This is a family of systems that includes recommender systems, which is one of the most successful classes of advice-giving software in practice. We investigate the purposes of explanations as well as how they are generated, presented to users, and evaluated. As a result, we derive a novel comprehensive taxonomy of aspects to be considered when designing explanation facilities for current and future decision support systems. The taxonomy includes a variety of different facets, such as explanation objective, responsiveness, content and presentation. Moreover, we identified several challenges that remain unaddressed so far, for example related to fine-grained issues associated with the presentation of explanations and how explanation facilities are evaluated.;"[Nunes, Ingrid] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Informat, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Nunes, Ingrid] TU Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany; [Jannach, Dietmar] TU Dortmund, Comp Sci, Dortmund, Germany";Nunes, I (corresponding author), TU Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany.;"ingridnunes@inf.ufrgs.br; dietmar.jannach@tu-dortmund.de";Nunes, Ingrid/A-3715-2014;Nunes, Ingrid/0000-0002-6879-5829;"CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [303232/2015-3]; CAPESCAPES [7619-15-4];  [BRA 1184533 HFSTCAPES-P]";The authors would like to thank Michael Jugovac for carefully proofreading this paper.

Setting up assistive technologies or finding settings to overcome a certain barrier can be a demanding task for people without technical skills. Context-sensitive adaptive user interfaces are advancing, although migrating access features from one device to another is very rarely addressed. In this paper, we describe the knowledge-based component of the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure that infers how a device shall be best configured at the operating system layer, the application layer and the web layer to meet the requirements of a user including possible special needs or disabilities. In this regard, a mechanism to detect and resolve conflicting accessibility policies as well as recommending preference substitutes is a main requirement, as elaborated in this paper. As the proposed system emulates decision-making of accessibility experts, we validated the automatic deduced configurations against manual configurations of ten accessibility experts. The assessment result shows that the average matching score of the developed system is high. Thus, the proposed system can be considered capable of making precise decisions towards personalizing user interfaces based on user needs and preferences.;"[Loitsch, Claudia; Weber, Gerhard] Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Comp Sci, Mommsenstr 13, D-01602 Dresden, Germany; [Kaklanis, Nikolaos; Votis, Konstantinos; Tzovaras, Dimitrios] Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Informat Technol Inst, 6th Km Harilaou Thermi, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece";Loitsch, C (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Comp Sci, Mommsenstr 13, D-01602 Dresden, Germany.;"Claudia.Loitsch@tu-dresden.de; Gerhard.Weber@tu-dresden.de; nkak@iti.gr; kvotis@iti.gr; tzovaras@iti.gr";;"Weber, Gerhard/0000-0002-1890-4281; votis, konstantinos/0000-0001-6381-8326";European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [289016];We thank all participants that took part in our interviews and user studies.

To estimate the MS model parameters, we propose a method based on the Fuzzy Expectation-Maximization (FEM) algorithm, which integrates the evidence of the field inspection outcomes with information taken from the maintenance operators about the transition times from one state to another. Possibility distributions are used to describe the imprecision in the expert statements. A procedure for estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based on the MS model and conditional on such imprecise evidence is, then, developed. The proposed method is applied to a case study concerning the degradation of pipe welds in the coolant system of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). The obtained results show that the combination of field data with expert knowledge can allow reducing the uncertainty in degradation estimation and RUL prediction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The experience of the group composed of masonry instructors and master masons averaged five times that of the other groups, their productivity was highest, and the loads on their joints were the lowest. Thus, they were deemed experts in this paper. Inertial measurement units (IMU) and video cameras were used to collect kinematic data of the masons, from which pose clusters were identified. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used to classify masons' poses into expert and inexpert classes based on the relative frequency of poses in the motions used to lay each of 945 masonry units. Two classification scenarios were tested. While both scenarios achieved similar levels of accuracy, 91.23% and 92.04% respectively, the processing time for binary classification was only 13 s compared to 523 s for inter-group multiclass SVM. Like characteristic vibration frequencies in machine diagnostics and system identification, the characteristic poses identified provide insight into differing methods between expert and less experienced masons. For example, results show that experts utilize fewer and more ergonomicaly safe poses, while being more productive, which indicates lower energy expenditure (less wasted motions). The classification method and the poses identified contribute knowledge to help develop affordable mason training systems that utilize IMU and video feedback to improve health and productivity of apprentice masons.;"[Alwasel, Abdullatif; Abdel-Rahman, Eihab] Univ Waterloo, Dept Syst Design Engn, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Sabet, Ali; Nahangi, Mohammad; Haas, Carl T.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Civil Infrastruct Sensing Lab, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada";Haas, CT (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Civil Infrastruct Sensing Lab, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.;chaas@uwaterloo.ca;Alwasel, Abdullatif/AAZ-1526-2020;Alwasel, Abdullatif/0000-0003-3198-8157;"King Saud UniversityKing Saud University; Canadian Concrete Masonry Producers Association (CCMPA); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [CRDPJ 494786-16]";The first author would like to acknowledge the support provided by King Saud University.

This study aimed to investigate the reliability of an automated system. Methods: We compared 3745 serum samples using NOVA View archived images with manual analysis via microscopy. A custom cutoff value was established to distinguish ANA titers and was validated in two clinical laboratories. The automatic ANA pattern recognition system was evaluated, and all ANA-positive sera were subjected to two commercial ANA IIF kits to compare the consistency of the pattern interpretation results. For inconsistent patterns, a third ANA IIF testing kit was utilized. Results: Agreement of the interpretation of the ANA IIF test using the platform of NOVA View and manual microscopy was 96.9%. The local cutoff value to discriminate ANA titers in four main ANA patterns was calculated based on 1390 serum samples. In our laboratory, the titer prediction accuracy was superior to the preset cutoff in NOVA View (p < 0.01); the performance was similar in another laboratory (p = 0.11). The automatic pattern recognition accuracies of speckled, homogeneous, centromere, nucleolar and nuclear dot patterns were 62.7%, 57.4%, 92.6%, 30.5% and 27.3%, respectively. The consistency of the pattern interpretation results between INOVA and MBL kits was 95.3%. Conclusions: It is necessary to establish a custom value-added ANA report.

Such labels are often affected by significant uncertainty and inconsistency due to varying human's experience and constitutions during the labeling process. This typically results in significant, unintended class overlaps. We propose several new concepts for providing enhanced explanations of classifier decisions in linguistic (human readable) form. These are intended to help operators to better understand the decision process and support them during sample annotation to improve their certainty and consistency in successive labeling cycles. This is expected to lead to better, more consistent data sets (streams) for use in training and updating classifiers. The enhanced explanations are composed of (1) grounded reasons for classification decisions, represented as linguistically readable fuzzy rules, (2) a classifier's level of uncertainty in relation to its decisions and possible alternative suggestions, (3) the degree of novelty of current samples and (4) the levels of impact of the input features on the current classification response. The last of these are based on a newly developed approach for eliciting instance-based feature importance levels, and are also used to reduce the lengths of the rules to a maximum of 3 to 4 antecedent parts to ensure readability for operators and users. The proposed techniques were embedded within an annotation GUI and applied to a real-world application scenario from the field of visual inspection. The usefulness of the proposed linguistic explanations was evaluated based on experiments conducted with six operators. The results indicate that there is approximately an 80% chance that operator/user labeling behavior improves significantly when enhanced linguistic explanations are provided, whereas this chance drops to 10% when only the classifier responses are shown.

This study aimed to establish indicators for the appropriate use of triazoles for invasive fungal disease, so as to produce a reference for evaluating and standardizing the rational application of triazole antifungals. MethodsA comprehensive analysis and literature review were conducted to construct an evaluation system for indications, therapeutic timing, duration of drug usage, drug dosage, administration method, drug interactions, medication in specific populations and pharmaceutical care. A Delphi questionnaire was designed based on the preliminary evaluation of an indicator system that comprised eight primary indicators, 29 secondary indicators and 54 tertiary indicators. A Delphi panel survey was completed by 28 and 26 experts in the first and second rounds, respectively, via e-mail. Agreement was considered to be reached when the median score was in the top tertile (4 or 5), and 80% of panel scores were in the top tertile. The experts mainly comprised physicians and clinical pharmacists from different regions. Based on expert opinions, the evaluation indicator system was modified and the final version was established. ResultsThe response rate was high in the first and second rounds, at 100% and 93%, respectively, as was the dependability coefficient (0.83). The expert opinions resulted in four secondary indicators and nine tertiary indicators being deleted, and 10 tertiary indicators being modified. After the two rounds of the Delphi survey, the final established system of indicators comprised eight primary indicators, 25 secondary indicators and 45 tertiary indicators. What is new and conclusionsContrasted with previous studies that have only focused on a subset of indicators, this research establishes comprehensive indicators for evaluating the use of triazoles for invasive fungal disease and which cover most of the medication process: indications, therapeutic timing, duration of drug usage, drug dosage, administration method, drug interactions, medication in specific populations and pharmaceutical care. The indicators can reflect the characteristic of triazoles throughout the process of clinical administration for an invasive fungal disease, and it will be helpful as references when hospital administrators are regulating the use of antifungals.";"[Dong, W.

Communication between pilots is a critical crew resource management skill, as flying an airplane requires coordinated action and collaboration by the flight deck crew. However, research that studied flight instructors' agreement in (and, thus, the accuracy of) their evaluation of pilots' communication behavior found little consistency in their judgments. As such, the present research explores the feasibility of a content-free approachcross-recurrence analysisto assess crew communication, in contrast to commonly employed content-based approaches that are grounded in speech act analysis.

Therefore, to improve the diagnostic performance of breast cancer detection using computer-aided system, identification and segmentation of pectoral muscle is an important task. This paper presents, an intensity based approach to identify the pectoral region in mammograms. In the presented approach enhancement mask and threshold technique is used to enhance and select the pectoral region and boundary points respectively, to find the boundary of pectoral muscle. Then curve fitting by Least Square Error (LSE) method is used to refine the rough initial boundaries. The proposed approach was applied on 320 mammograms from mini-Mammographic Image Analysis Society (mini-MIAS) database of 322 mammograms, with acceptable rate of 96.56% from radiologist experts. The performance evaluation for pectoral muscle segmentation, based on Hausdorff distance (Hd), False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) rate, shows the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.;"[Vikhe, P.

However, there are no data collection systems to concurrently record PA and behavioral support. This paper describes the development and validation of the System for Observing Behavioral Ecology for Youth in Schools (SOBEYS)an instrument used with existing observation systems to record PA within a behavioral ecological context. METHODSIn 2013, experts created a set of behavioral categories to record prompting and reinforcement of PA during a recreational school activity program. The school provided supervision and equipment for lunchtime PA, making it possible to assess both PA and behavioral support. The system was implemented in spring semester 2014 at 1 suburban junior high school (N = 1452; 48% girls, 74% Caucasian) in the western Unites States. RESULTSFollowing multiple field trials, the SOBEYS instrument recorded behavioral categories of visual and verbal prompting, verbal, and nonreinforcement by adults and peers, and token reinforcement. Construct validity and acceptable interobserver agreement (>90%; kappa between 0.22 and 0.94) resulted.

We present a novel pattern recognition algorithm for Pattern Matching, that we successfully used to construct more than 16,000 new intraday price patterns. After processing and analysis, we extracted 3518 chart formations that are capable of predicting the short-term direction of prices. In our experiments, we used forex time series from 8 paired-currencies in various time frames. The system computes the probabilities of events such as within next 5 periods, price will increase more than 20 pips. Results show that the system is capable of finding patterns whose output signals (tested on unseen data) have predictive accuracy which varies between 60 and 85% depending on the type of pattern. We test the usefulness of the discovered patterns, via implementation of an expert system using a straightforward strategy based on the direction and the accuracy of the pattern predictions. We compare our method against three standard trading techniques plus a random trader, and we also test against the results presented in two recently published studies.

This is because they have to provide one value per each alternative and criteria. In this paper, we focus on solving this issue by carrying out multi-criteria group decision making methods using a different novel approach. Concretely, fuzzy ontologies reasoning procedures are used in order to automatically obtain the alternatives ranking classification. Thanks to our novel methodology, experts only need to provide the importance of a small set of criteria values making it possible for experts to perform multi-criteria group decision making procedures that have a high amount of alternatives without having to directly deal with them. Furthermore, in order to allow experts to provide their preferences in a comfortable way, multi-granular fuzzy linguistic modelling is used in order to allow each expert to choose the linguistic label set that better fits him/her.

As the number of detections per night at a single telescope easily exceeds several thousand, current detection pipelines make intensive use of machine learning algorithms to classify the detected objects and to filter out the most interesting candidates. A number of upcoming surveys will produce up to three orders of magnitude more data, which renders high-precision classification systems essential to reduce the manual and, hence, expensive vetting by human experts. We present an approach based on convolutional neural networks to discriminate between true astrophysical sources and artefacts in reference-subtracted optical images. We show that relatively simple networks are already competitive with state-of-the-art systems and that their quality can further be improved via slightly deeper networks and additional pre-processing steps - eventually yielding models outperforming state-of-the-art systems. In particular, our best model correctly classifies about 97.3 per cent of all 'real' and 99.7 per cent of all 'bogus' instances on a test set containing 1942 'bogus' and 227 'real' instances in total. Furthermore, the networks considered in this work can also successfully classify these objects at hand without relying on difference images, which might pave the way for future detection pipelines not containing image subtraction steps at all.;"[Gieseke, Fabian; van den Bogaard, Cas; Heskes, Tom] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Comp & Informat Sci, POB 9010, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Gieseke, Fabian] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Comp Sci, Sigurdsgade 41, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bloemen, Steven; Ribeiro, Valerio A.

The proposed model tries to deal with four major issues associated with the FTS modeling approach, viz., determination of the lengths of intervals, determination of fuzzy logical relations (FLRs), inclusion of repeated FLRs, and defuzzification operation. For the determination of effective lengths of intervals, frequency-based discretization approach is proposed, which partitions the time series data set into various lengths. For establishment of the FLRs and their better representation, an artificial neural network-based architecture is developed. Another novel idea is contributed to the article by considering repeated FLRs during forecasting. Last but not the least, this study introduces a new entropy-based defuzzification technique for the defuzzification operation. The model is verified and validated with real-world data sets.

Typically, the missions are followed by intervals which can be used for maintenance. This is a suitable condition for employment of selective maintenance strategy. However, this maintenance interval is bound by the constraints of time, resources and desired reliability before the start of the next mission. This calls for optimization of maintenance activities that can be fitted into the maintenance break. There is also a requirement of having a forecasting technique for reducing the supply lead times. This paper lays out a methodology to use simulation for predicting failures in the army equipment. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach is then used for optimizing the maintenance activities before the start of the maintenance break. The process of Simulation plus GA Optimization is automated using a program in MATLAB. The novelty of the work lies in modifying the process of Simulation and GA Optimization to suit the exact modus operandi employed by the Army in deploying equipment for peace, training exercise and war (mission with or without some maintenance break) separately. In addition to optimizing the maintenance activities, the methodology also helps in forecasting the requirement of spare parts both before and during the mission. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The energy planning decision-making (EPDM) field relies on a plethora of decision analysis methods that offered many solutions to process a variety of energy management and strategic decision-making problems. However, current EPDM solutions are unable to overcome the increasing complexity of strategic energy planning situations involving a large number of stakeholders in uncertain, dynamic, and distributed environments. This raises significant new challenges for researchers in both decision sciences and renewable and sustainable energy planning. On the basis of a representative assortment of peer-reviewed related literature selected by querying multiple electronic databases and indexed in Scopus and Web of Science databases domain journals over the last 12 years, this paper exhaustively highlights and discusses limitations of existing strategic EPDM solutions. The analysis is based on a classification specially developed by holistically harmonizing important domain concepts to categorize the considered representative sample of the field of interest. Additionally, this paper integrates results and conclusions from some recent and most cited literature reviews to (i) formulate essential evidence as well as practical and conclusive literature's support alongside with the formulated representative sample to this paper's subsequent insights and statements, and (ii) guarantee that no relevant articles have been excluded. A total of 78 related works is gathered and analyzed to provide a general view and discussion on major complexities found in classical/traditional strategic EPDM solutions and challenges for next-generation EPDM solutions. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the two solutions and a set of quality indexes of a next generation EPDM solution were identified and some proposals were made to improve future applicative research. As an original result coming from the quality indexes identified through the review process, an intelligent expert-based framework for next-generation EPDM solutions is developed for enhanced renewable and sustainable energy planning.;"[Sellak, Hamza; Ouhbi, Brahim] Moulay Ismail Univ, Natl Higher Sch Arts & Crafts, Ind Engn & Prod Dept, Meknes, Morocco; [Frikh, Bouchra] Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah Univ, Higher Sch Technol, Comp Sci Dept, Fes, Morocco; [Palomares, Ivan] Univ Bristol, Merchant Venturers Sch Engn, Bristol, Avon, England";Sellak, H (corresponding author), Moulay Ismail Univ, Natl Higher Sch Arts & Crafts, Ind Engn & Prod Dept, Meknes, Morocco.;"h.sellak@edu.umi.ac.ma; ouhbib@yahoo.co.uk; bfrikh@yahoo.com; i.palomares@bristol.ac.uk";"Sellak, Hamza/ABB-7237-2020; Palomares, Ivan/AAR-6496-2020";"Sellak, Hamza/0000-0003-3666-8136; Palomares, Ivan/0000-0003-4335-9139";;;;241;12;12;4;71;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;1364-0321;;;RENEW SUST ENERG REV;Renew.

If fuzzy logic is used in multi-criteria decision-making, the criteria are described by linguistic variables that can be represented through fuzzy membership and expert judgment is used to describe such a system. Prior hydrodynamic modeling of the aquifer regime defines the management scenarios for groundwater control and provides an indication of their effectiveness. In this paper, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is applied to deal with a trending decision problem such as the selection of the optimal groundwater management system. Linguistic variables are used to evaluate all the criteria and sub-criteria that influence the final decision and the numerical weights of each alternative are determined by mathematical calculations. The paper presents a part of the algorithm - fuzzy optimization in hydrodynamic analysis, which leads to the selection of the optimal groundwater control system.

The performance and power of the system depends on the architecture of the DRAM chip, the design of the memory controller and the access patterns received by the memory controller. Thus, evaluating the impact of DRAM design decisions requires a holistic approach that includes an appropriate model of the DRAM bank, a realistic controller and DRAM power model, and a representative workload, which requires a full system simulator running a complete software stack. In this paper, we introduce DRAMSpec, a high-level DRAM bank/chip modeling tool. Our contribution is to move the DRAM modeling abstraction level from the circuit level to the DRAM bank and by the integration in full system simulators we allow system or processor designers (non-DRAM experts) to tune future DRAM architectures for their target applications. We demonstrate the merits of DRAMSpec by exploring the influence of DRAM row-buffer (page) size and the number of banks on performance and power of a server application (memcached). Our new DRAM design offers a 16% DRAM performance improvement and 13% DRAM energy saving compared to standard comodity DDR3 devices. Additionally, we demonstrate how our tool is able to aid in evaluating novel DRAM architectures, such as the Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), for which no DRAM datasheets are available.

The proposed system collects comprehensive information about a disease from a group of experts. To this aim, a cross-sectional study is conducted by asking physicians' expertise on all symptoms relevant to a disease. A fuzzy rule based system is then formed based on this information, which contains a set of significant symptoms relevant to the suspected disease. Linguistic fuzzy values are assigned to model each symptom. The input of the system is the severity level of each symptom reported by patients. The proposed FES considers two approaches to account for uncertain inputs from patients. Two case studies on kidney stone and kidney infection were conducted to demonstrate how the proposed method could be used. A group of patients were used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed expert system. The results show that the proposed fuzzy expert system is capable of diagnosing diseases with a high degree of accuracy and precision comparing to a couple of machine learning methods.

The training data is prepared by randomly selecting some text sentences from the large corpus of financial text. Conventionally, bootstrapping algorithm is used to annotate large volume of unlabeled data by learning from a small set of annotated data. However, the small set of annotated data have to be carefully chosen as seed data. Thus, our approach is a digress from the conventional approach of bootstrapping as we let the users randomly select the seed data. We show that our proposed algorithm has an accuracy of 73.56% in classifying the financial texts into the different categories (Accounting, Cost, Employee, Financing, Sales, Investments, Operations, Profit, Regulations and Irrelevant) even when the training data is just 30% of the total data set. Additionally, the accuracy improves by an approximate average of 2% for an increase of the training data by 10% and the accuracy of our system is 77.91% when the training data is about 50% of the total data set. As a dictionary of hand chosen keywords prepared by domain experts are often used for financial text extraction, we assumed the existence of almost linearly separable hyperplanes between the different classes and therefore, we have used Linear Support Vector Machine along with a modified version of Label Propagation Algorithm which exploits the notion of neighborhood (in Euclidean space) for classification. We believe that our proposed techniques will be of help to Early Warning Systems used in banks where large volumes of unstructured texts need to be processed for better insights about a company.

In such contexts, both existing sets of technologies and ingrained, often formalised practices, the 'rules of the game', constrain any opportunity for intervention. Additionally, 'civic' and expert groups with conflicting agendas and divergent demands on public choices assert their influence in these transformation programmes. The article argues that established methods in collaborative systems design have thus far overlooked the role of recurring actions involved in public participation as well as the formal rules and ingrained practices that construct them. Yet, such patterns present a valuable resource for design interventions. Thus, based on an institutional approach, the article outlines a methodology for requirement gathering by mapping the relations of actors, software and their use along identifiable action situations. The method called for a dialogue between socio-technical-spatial contexts of public service and specific actions taking place within it. Drawing on a case of organising civic engagement in urban planning, the article discusses how to find and trace existing practices across social settings, information technologies and material contexts where engagements take place.

Aesthetic perception in olfaction as a decision-making process;NEW IDEAS IN PSYCHOLOGY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"SENSE; EXPERT; SYSTEM; SMELL";Is the sense of smell a source of aesthetic perception? Traditional philosophical aesthetics has centered on vision and audition but eliminated smell for its subjective and inherently affective character. This article dismantles the myth that olfaction is an unsophisticated sense. It makes a case for olfactory aesthetics by integrating recent insights in neuroscience with traditional expertise about flavor and fragrance assessment in perfumery and wine tasting. My analysis concerns the importance of observational refinement in aesthetic experience. I argue that the active engagement with stimulus features in perceptual processing shapes the phenomenological content, so much so that the perceptual structure of trained smelling varies significantly from naive smelling. In a second step, I interpret the processes that determine such perceptual refinement in the context of neural decision-making processes, and I end with a positive outlook on how research in neuroscience can be used to benefit philosophical aesthetics.

To assess the overall condition of this valuable asset, health index calculations are recently gaining more attention from the utility companies that operate networks. Only limited research has been conducted on health index calculations of transformers. Most of the past approaches are based on the linear combination of weighted scores of measurements following the industry standards such as IEEE, IEC and CIGRE. A few previous methods based on artificial intelligence and statistical approaches such as fuzzy logic, multivariate analysis and binary logistic regression have been published in recent years. In this paper, a General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) which has a nice nonlinear property and can work with measurements without quantization has been evaluated. The GRNN allows multi-dimensional measurements to be combined through an optimal weighting and scoring system to compute a quantitative health index of power transformers. The weighting of each test was assigned based on a smoothly interpolated continuous function. The efficacy of the model has been validated against expert classifications and data sets published in the literature. The comparative results demonstrate that, the proposed method is reliable and very effective for condition assessment of transformers through an automated health index calculation.

However, the process of selecting flow control structures in irrigation networks is highly complex and involves different levels of decision makers. In this paper, we apply multi-attribute decision making (MADM) methodology to develop a decision analysis (DA) framework for evaluating, ranking and selecting check and intake structures for irrigation canals. The DA framework consists of identifying relevant attributes for canal structures, developing a robust scoring system for alternatives, identifying a procedure for data quality control, and identifying a MADM model for the decision analysis. An application is illustrated through an analysis for automation purposes of the Qazvin irrigation network, one of the oldest and most complex irrigation networks in Iran. A survey questionnaire designed based on the decision framework was distributed to experts, managers, and operators of the Qazvin network and to experts from the Ministry of Power in Iran. Five check structures and four intake structures were evaluated. A decision matrix was generated from the average scores collected from the survey, and was subsequently solved using TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method. To identify the most critical structure attributes for the selection process, optimal attribute weights were calculated using Entropy method. For check structures, results show that the duckbill weir is the preferred structure while the pivotweir is the least preferred. Use of the duckbill weir can potentially address the problem with existing Amil gates where manual intervention is required to regulate water levels during periods of flowextremes. For intake structures, the Neyrpic (R) gate and constant head orifice are the most and least preferred alternatives, respectively. Some advantages of the Neyrpic (R) gate are ease of operation and capacity to measure discharge flows. Overall, the application to the Qazvin irrigation network demonstrates the utility of the proposed DA framework in selecting appropriate structures for regulating water flows in irrigation canals. This framework systematically aids the decision process by capturing decisions made at various levels (individual farmers to high-level management).

Different from previous studies, we propose the intelligent driving methods (IDMs), including expert knowledge system and online optimization algorithms, to achieve the multi-objective (safety, punctuality, energy efficient, passengers' riding comfort, and so on) control of HST. First, we establish the expert knowledge system based on the driving data and control rules of excellent drivers. Then, in order to enhance the adaptability and real-time performance of proposed IDMs, two online optimization algorithms, including exact online programming driving (EOPD) and inexact online programming driving (IOPD), are developed by improved gradient descent and stochastic meta-decent method to update the controller's output online. Finally, using the field data collected from Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway, the proposed IDMs are verified under the real speed-limit conditions. The simulation results show that EOPD and IOPD can achieve better performances than automatic driving method based on ATO, Fuzzy PID controller and traditional multi-objective optimization method, especially in passengers' riding comfort and energy-consumption, Furthermore, as the step size is selected with wide randomness in the updating process, IOPD has more operating mode switching times than EOPD but its punctuality is better.

However, the evidence on inequities in non-communicable diseases and their risks factors, particularly diet, has not been examined from a systems perspective. We report on an approach to developing a system oriented policy actor perspective on the multiple causes of inequities in healthy eating. Methods Collaborative conceptual modelling workshops were held in 2015 with an expert group of representatives from government, non-government health organisations and academia in Australia. The expert group built a systems model using a system dynamics theoretical perspective. The model developed from individual mind maps to pair blended maps, before being finalised as a causal loop diagram. Results The work of the expert stakeholders generated a comprehensive causal loop diagram of the determinants of inequity in healthy eating (the HE 2 Diagram). This complex dynamic system has seven sub-systems: (1) food supply and environment; (2) transport; (3) housing and the built environment; (4) employment; (5) social protection; (6) health literacy; and (7) food preferences. Discussion The HE 2 causal loop diagram illustrates the complexity of determinants of inequities in healthy eating. This approach, both the process of construction and the final visualisation, can provide the basis for planning the prevention and amelioration of inequities in healthy eating that engages with multiple levels of causes and existing policies and programs.";"[Friel, Sharon; Pescud, Melanie; Malbon, Eleanor] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Regulat & Global Governance RegNet, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Lee, Amanda; Rychetnik, Lucie] Sax Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Carter, Robert] Deakin Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Greenfield, Joanne] ACT Hlth, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Cobcroft, Megan] NSW Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Potter, Jane; Meertens, Beth] Natl Heart Fdn Australia, Melbourne, Vic, Australia";Friel, S (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Regulat & Global Governance RegNet, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;Sharon.friel@anu.edu.au;;Lee, Amanda/0000-0001-6887-5426;"Australian Prevention Partnership Centre through the NHMRCNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [GNT9100001]; Australian Government Department of HealthAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Health & Ageing; New South Wales Ministry of Health; Australian Capital Territory Health; HCF; HCF Research Foundation";This research was supported by The Australian Prevention Partnership Centre through the NHMRC partnership centre grant scheme (Grant ID: GNT9100001) with the Australian Government Department of Health, New South Wales Ministry of Health, Australian Capital Territory Health, HCF, and the HCF Research Foundation.;;54;29;29;2;16;PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE;SAN FRANCISCO;1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA;1932-6203;;;PLOS ONE;PLoS One;NOV 30;2017;12;11;;;;;;;e0188872;10.1371/journal.pone.0188872;;;18;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science & Technology - Other Topics;FO4UI;WOS:000416841900152;29190662;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-02-18;

When designing such systems, a critical aspect is to equip them with a rich enough knowledge base that, for each POI, indicates how much the POI is relevant for a set of possible topics of interests, also called TOIs for short. This paper focuses on the problem of designing the Content Analyzer of a content-based travel recommender system. The Content Analyzer is a module that receives as input a set of POIs and a set of TOIs and it computes the relevance of each POI with respect to each TOI. The proposed approach is unsupervised, fully automatic, and it relies on publicly available sources of information. We describe an implementation of the technique in a system called Cicero and present an experimental evaluation of its effectiveness against a ground truth generated by experts.

Such a process is time consuming and labor intensive. To reduce the workload and to improve the sleep stage scoring performance of sleep experts, this paper introduces an intelligent rapid eye movement (REM) sleep detection method that requires only a single EEG channel. The proposed approach distinguishes itself from previous automatic sleep staging methods by introducing two sets of auxiliary features to help resolve the difficulties caused by interpersonal EEG signal differences. In addition to adopting conventional time and frequency domain features, two empirical rules are introduced to enhance REM detection performance based on sleep being a continuous process. The approach was tested with 779,661 epochs obtained from 947 overnight PSG studies. The REM sleep detection results show a kappa coefficient at 0.752, an accuracy level of 0.930, a sensitivity score of 0.814, and a positive predictive value of 0.775. The results also show that the performance of the approach varies with the ratio of REM sleep and the severity of sleep apnea of the subjects. The experimental results also show that it is possible to improve the performance of an automatic sleep staging method by tailoring it to subgroups of persons that have similar sleep architecture and clinical characteristics.

These technological developments and wide adaptation of ubiquitous computing enable numerous opportunities for government and companies to reconsider healthcare prospects. Therefore, big data and smart healthcare systems are independently attracting extensive attention from both academia and industry. The combination of both big data and smart systems can expedite the prospects of the healthcare industry. However, a thorough study of big data and smart systems together in the healthcare context is still absent from the existing literature. The key contributions of this article include an organized evaluation of various big data and smart system technologies and a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art advanced healthcare systems. We describe the three-dimensional structure of a paradigm shift. We also extract three broad technical branches (3T) contributing to the promotion of healthcare systems. More specifically, we propose a big data enabled smart healthcare system framework (BSHSF) that offers theoretical representations of an infra and inter organizational business model in the healthcare context. We also mention some examples reported in the literature, and then we contribute to pinpointing the potential opportunities and challenges of applying BSHSF to healthcare business environments. We also make five recommendations for effectively applying 'BSHSF to the healthcare industry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study about state-of-the-art big data and smart healthcare systems in parallel. The managerial implication of this article is that organizations can use the findings of our critical analysis to reinforce their strategic arrangement of smart systems and big data in the healthcare context, and hence better leverage them for sustainable organizational invention.

It is highly performing but expensive and health information systems are scarcely implemented. The Swiss Primary Care Active Monitoring (SPAM) program aims to develop an instrument able to describe the performance and effectiveness of the Swiss PC system. Methods: Based on a Literature review we developed a conceptual framework and selected indicators according to their ability to reflect the Swiss PC system. A two round modified RAND method with 24 inter-/national experts took place to select primary/secondary indicators (validity, clarity, agreement). A limited set of priority indicators was selected (importance, priority) in a third round. Results: A conceptual framework covering three domains (structure, process, outcome) subdivided into twelve sections (funding, access, organisation/workflow of resources, (Para-) Medical training, management of knowledge, clinical-/interpersonal care, health status, satisfaction of PC providers/consumers, equity) was generated. 365 indicators were pre-selected and 335 were finally retained. 56 were kept as priority indicators.-Among the remaining, 199 were identified as primary and 80 as secondary indicators. All domains and sections are represented. Conclusion: The development of the SPAM program allowed the construction of a consensual instrument in a traditionally unregulated health system through a modified RAND method. The selected 56 priority indicators render the SPAM instrument a comprehensive tool supporting a better understanding of the Swiss PC system's performance and effectiveness as well as in identifying potential ways to improve quality of care. Further challenges will be to update indicators regularly and to assess validity and sensitivity-to-change over time.;"[Ebert, Sonja T.; Cornuz, Jacques; Senn, Nicolas] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ambulatory Care & Community Med, Bugnon 44, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Pittet, Valerie] Univ Lausanne, Inst Social & Prevent Med, Biopole 2, CH-1010 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Senn, Nicolas] Univ Lausanne, Inst Family Med, Lausanne, Switzerland";"Senn, N (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Dept Ambulatory Care & Community Med, Bugnon 44, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.; Senn, N (corresponding author), Univ Lausanne, Inst Family Med, Lausanne, Switzerland.";nicolas.senn@hospvd.ch;;Pittet, Valerie/0000-0003-2208-966X;"Swiss Federal Office of Public Health; Swiss Academy of Medical sciences (Bangerter Foundation); Department of ambulatory care and community medicine (University of Lausanne)";This project received funding from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health and the Swiss Academy of Medical sciences (Bangerter Foundation) in addition to an internal funding of the Department of ambulatory care and community medicine (University of Lausanne).;;35;1;1;0;3;BIOMED CENTRAL LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;1472-6963;;;BMC HEALTH SERV RES;BMC Health Serv.

Since various methodologies can be followed to develop tolerogenic therapies, it is important to be aware and up to date on all available studies that may be relevant to their improvement. Recently, knowledge graphs have been proposed to link various sources of information, using text mining techniques. Knowledge graphs facilitate the automatic retrieval of information about the topics represented in the graph. The objective of this work was to automatically generate a knowledge graph for tolerogenic cell therapy from biomedical literature. We developed a system, ICReI, based on machine learning to extract relations between cells and cytokines from abstracts. Our system retrieves related documents from PubMed, annotates each abstract with cell and cytokine named entities, generates the possible combinations of cell cytokine pairs cooccurring in the same sentence, and identifies meaningful relations between cells and cytokines. The extracted relations were used to generate a knowledge graph, where each edge was supported by one or more documents. We obtained a graph containing 647 cell cytokine relations, based on 3,264 abstracts. The modules of ICReI were evaluated with cross-validation and manual evaluation of the relations extracted. The relation extraction module obtained an F-measure of 0.789 in a reference database, while the manual evaluation obtained an accuracy of 0.615. Even though the knowledge graph is based on information that was already published in other articles about immunology, the system we present is more efficient than the laborious task of manually reading all the literature to find indirect or implicit relations. The ICRel graph will help experts identify implicit relations that may not be evident in published studies.;"[Lamurias, Andre; Ferreira, Joao D.; Couto, Francisco M.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, LaSIGE, Lisbon, Portugal; [Clarke, Luka A.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, BioISI Biosyst & Integrat Sci Inst, Lisbon, Portugal";Lamurias, A (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, LaSIGE, Lisbon, Portugal.;alamurias@lasige.di.fc.ul.pt;"Couto, Francisco M/A-4066-2010; Clarke, Luka A/E-5843-2012";"Couto, Francisco M/0000-0003-0627-1496; Clarke, Luka A/0000-0003-3254-9121; Ferreira, Joao/0000-0002-6900-3168";Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [PD/BD/106083/2015, UID/MULTI/04046/2013, UID/CEC/00408/2013];This work was supported by the Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (http://www.fct.pt/) through the PhD Grant ref.

In order to address specific therapeutic challenges in certain subgroups of patients who do not sufficiently respond to classical CBT, some of these third-wave strategies put particular emphasis on therapist self-disclosure. This article highlights therapeutic self-disclosure as a means to address interpersonal problems by comparing three third-wave strategies: (a) acceptance and change strategies as used in Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), (b) the concept of limited reparenting as used in Schema Therapy (ST), and (c) disciplined personal involvement as used in the Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP).

The present work aims at developing a decision-making scoring system by means of a probabilistic assessment to standardize production process of Alorena de Malaga table olives based on the identification of potential hazards or deficiencies in hygienic processes for the subsequent implementation of corrective measures. A total of 658 microbiological and physico-chemical data were collected over three consecutive olive campaigns (2014-2016) to measure the variability and relative importance of each elaboration step on total hygienic quality and product safety. Three representative companies were visited to collect samples from food-contact surfaces, olive fruits, brines, air environment, olive dressings, water tanks, and finished/packaged products. A probabilistic assessment was done based on the establishment of Performance Hygiene and Safety Scores (PHSS 0-100%) through a standardized system for evaluating product acceptability. The mean value of the global PHSS for the Alorena de Malaga table olives processing (PHHSFTOT) was 64.82% (90th CI: 52.78-76.39%) indicating the high variability among facilities in the evaluated processing steps on final product quality and safety. Washing and cracking, and selection and addition of olive dressings were detected as the most deficient ones in relation to PHSSW values (p < 0.05) (mean = 53.02 and 56.62%, respectively). The relative contribution of each processing step was quantified by different experts (n = 25) from the Alorena de Malaga table olive sector through a weighted PHSS (PHSSw). The mean value of PHSSw was 65.53% (90th CI: 53.12-77.52%). The final processing steps obtained higher values for PHSSw being the finished product the most relevant one (mean = 18.44%; 90% CI: 10.34-25.33%). Sensitivity analysis concluded that intervention measures focused on reducing the contamination of washing brines could lead to an improvement of PHSSFTOT value to 67.03%. The present work can be potentially applied in the Alorena de Malaga table olive food sector for improving food quality and safety assurance.";"[Ruiz Bellido, Miguel A.; Romero Gil, Veronica] Regulatory Council PDO Alorena Malaga Table Olive, Malaga, Spain; [Valero, Antonio; Posada-Izquierdo, Guiomar D.; Rincon, Francisco; Possas, Aricia; Garcia-Gimeno, Rosa M.] Univ Cordoba, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Cordoba, Spain; [Medina Pradas, Eduardo; Romero Gil, Veronica; Rodriguez-Gomez, Francisco; Arroyo-Lopez, Francisco N.] CSIC, Food Biotechnol Dept, Inst Grasa, Univ Campus Pablo de Olavide, Seville, Spain";Valero, A (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Cordoba, Spain.;bt2vadia@uco.es;"Garcia-Gimeno, Rosa Maria/L-4837-2014; Valero, Antonio/K-6777-2014; Eduardo, Medina/D-3296-2014";"Garcia-Gimeno, Rosa Maria/0000-0001-5241-6348; Rodriguez-Gomez, Francisco/0000-0002-4738-4764; Possas, Aricia/0000-0002-5006-8703; Eduardo, Medina/0000-0002-9978-4524; Arroyo-Lopez, Francisco Noe/0000-0001-6308-7746";"Junta de Andalucia Government through the PrediAlo project [AGR-7755]; FEDER European fundsEuropean Union (EU); Santander Bank; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq-Brazil)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)";The research leading to these results has received funding from Junta de Andalucia Government through the PrediAlo project (AGR-7755: www.predialo.science.com.es) and FEDER European funds.

Our analysis of the acquired terabyte-sized collection is motivated by the need to understand the nature of the shape dimensionality (1D vs 2D vs 3D) of cell-scaffold interactions relevant to tissue engineers that grow cells on biomaterial scaffolds. Results: We designed five statistical and three geometrical contact models, and then down-selected them to one from each category using a validation approach based on physically orthogonal measurements to CLSM. The two selected models were applied to 414 z-stacks with three scaffold types and all contact results were visually verified. A planar geometrical model for the spun coat scaffold type was validated from atomic force microscopy images by computing surface roughness of 52.35 nm +/- 31.76 nm which was 2 to 8 times smaller than the CLSM resolution. A cylindrical model for fiber scaffolds was validated from multi-view 2D scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The fiber scaffold segmentation error was assessed by comparing fiber diameters from SEM and CLSM to be between 0.46% to 3.8% of the SEM reference values. For contact verification, we constructed a web-based visual verification system with 414 pairs of images with cells and their segmentation results, and with 4968 movies with animated cell, scaffold, and contact overlays. Based on visual verification by three experts, we report the accuracy of cell segmentation to be 96.4% with 94.3% precision, and the accuracy of cell-scaffold contact for a statistical model to be 62.6% with 76.7% precision and for a geometrical model to be 93.5% with 87.6% precision. Conclusions: The novelty of our approach lies in (1) representing cell-scaffold contact sites with statistical intensity and geometrical shape models, (2) designing a methodology for validating 3D geometrical contact models and (3) devising a mechanism for visual verification of hundreds of 3D measurements.

Despite easy accessibility of the oral cavity and hence early detection of oral cancers, majority are diagnosed in advanced stages in the Asian countries. Innovation in oral cancer diagnostics, as well as theranostics for precision medicine, would aid their early diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, not to mention discovery of novel molecular targets for drug development.

In the present study, methotrexate loaded LPHNPs consisted of PLGA and Lipoid S100 were fabricated by employing a single-step modified nanoprecipitation method combined with self-assembly. A three factor, three level Box Behnken design using Design-Expert (R) software was employed to access the influence of three independent variables on the particle size, drug entrapment and percent drug release. The optimized formulation was selected through numeric optimization approach. The results were supported with the ANOVA analysis, regression equations and response surface plots. Transmission electron microscope images indicated the nanosized and spherical shape of the LPHNPs with fair size distribution. The nanoparticles ranged from 176 to 308 nm, which increased with increased polymer concentration. The increase in polymer and lipid concentration also increased the drug entrapment efficiency. The in vitro drug release was in range 70.34-91.95% and the release mechanism follow the Higuchi model (R-2 = 0.9888) and Fickian diffusion (n < 0.5). The in vitro cytotoxicity assay and confocal microscopy of the optimized formulation demonstrate the good safety and better internalization of the LPHNPs. The cell antiproliferation showed the spatial and controlled action of the nanoformulation as compared to the plain drug solution. The results suggest that LPHNPs can be a promising delivery system envisioned to safe, stable and potentially controlled delivery of methotrexate to the cancer cells to achieve better therapeutic outcomes.;"[Tahir, Nayab; Madni, Asadullah; Rehman, Mubashar; Kashif, Prince Muhammad] Islamia Univ Bahawalpur, Dept Pharm, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan; [Tahir, Nayab; Balasubramanian, Vimalkumar; Correia, Alexandra; Santos, Helder A.] Univ Helsinki, Fac Pharm, Div Pharmaceut Chem & Technol, Drug Res Program, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Santos, Helder A.] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Life Sci HiLIFE, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Makila, Ermei; Salonen, Jarno] Univ Turku, Dept Phys, Lab Ind Phys, FI-20014 Turku, Finland";"Madni, A (corresponding author), Islamia Univ Bahawalpur, Dept Pharm, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan.; Santos, HA (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Pharm, Div Pharmaceut Chem & Technol, Drug Res Program, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.";"asadpharmacist@hotmail.com; helder.santos@helsinki.fi";"Tahir, Nayab/K-8442-2019; Santos, Helder A./B-5253-2009; Rehman, Mubashar/J-1508-2015; balasubramanian, vimalkumar/H-6638-2015";"Santos, Helder A./0000-0001-7850-6309; balasubramanian, vimalkumar/0000-0002-9856-5143; Makila, Ermei/0000-0002-8300-6533";"International Research Support Initiative Program (IRSIP) of Higher Education Commission of Pakistan; Higher Education Commission of PakistanHigher Education Commission of Pakistan; Helsinki Institute of Life Science; Sigrid Juselius FoundationSigrid Juselius Foundation [4704580]; European Research Council under European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [310892]";Nayab Tahir acknowledges the International Research Support Initiative Program (IRSIP) of Higher Education Commission of Pakistan for the travel grant for University of Helsinki Finland.

We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of segmenting the population into discrete, non-overlapping groups using a practical expert and literature driven approach. We hypothesized that this approach is feasible utilizing the electronic health record (EHR) in SingHealth. Methods: In addition to well-defined segments of Mostly healthy, Serious acute illness but curable and End of life segments that are also present in the Ministry of Health Singapore framework, patients with chronic diseases were segmented into Stable chronic disease, Complex chronic diseases without frequent hospital admissions, and Complex chronic diseases with frequent hospital admissions. Using the electronic health record (EHR), we applied this framework to all adult patients who had a healthcare encounter in the Singapore Health Services Regional Health System in 2012. ICD-9, 10 and polyclinic codes were used to define chronic diseases with a comprehensive look-back period of 5 years. Outcomes (hospital admissions, emergency attendances, specialist outpatient clinic attendances and mortality) were analyzed for years 2012 to 2015. Results: Eight hundred twenty five thousand eight hundred seventy four patients were included in this study with the majority being healthy without chronic diseases. The most common chronic disease was hypertension. Patients with complex chronic disease with frequent hospital admissions segment represented 0.6% of the eligible population, but accounted for the highest hospital admissions (4.33 +/- 2.12 admissions; p < 0.001) and emergency attendances (ED) (3.21 +/- 3.16 ED visits; p < 0.001) per patient, and a high mortality rate (16%). Patients with metastatic disease accounted for the highest specialist outpatient clinic attendances (27.48 +/- 23.68 visits; p < 0.001) per patient despite their relatively shorter course of illness and high one-year mortality rate (33%). Conclusion: This practical segmentation framework can potentially distinguish among groups of patients, and highlighted the high disease burden of patients with chronic diseases.

The Dutch Effectiveness Rating System (ERS) for health promotion interventions is an improvement-oriented approach in which multi-disciplinary expert committees rate available health promotion interventions as 'theoretically sound', 'probably effective' or 'proven effective'. The aim of this study is to explore the functioning of the ERS and the perspective of researchers, policy-makers and practitioners regarding its contribution to improvement. Methods: We interviewed 53 selected key informants from research, policy and practice in the Netherlands and observed the assessment of 12 interventions. Results: Between 2008 and 2012, a total of 94 interventions were submitted to the ERS, of which 23 were rejected, 58 were rated as 'theoretically sound', 10 were rated as 'probably effective' and 3 were rated as 'proven effective'. According to participants, the ERS was intended to facilitate both the improvement of available interventions and the improvement of health promotion in practice. While participants expected that describing and rating interventions promoted learning and enhanced the transferability of interventions, they were concerned that the ERS approach was not suitable for guiding intervention development and improving health promotion in practice. The expert committees that assessed the interventions struggled with a lack of norms for the relevance of effects and questions about how effects should be studied and rated. Health promotion practitioners were concerned that the ERS neglected the local adaptation of interventions and did not encourage the improvement of aspects like applicability and costs. Policy-makers and practitioners were worried that the lack of proven effectiveness legitimised cutbacks rather than learning and advancing health promotion. Conclusion: While measuring and centrally rating the effectiveness of interventions can be beneficial, the evidence based-inspired ERS approach is too limited to guide both intervention development and the improvement of health promotion in practice. To better contribute to improving health promotion, a more reflexive and responsive guidance approach is required, namely one which stimulates the improvement of different intervention aspects, provides targeted recommendations to practitioners and provides feedback to those who develop and rate interventions.;"[Kok, Maarten Olivier; Bal, Roland] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Kok, Maarten Olivier; Schuit, Albertine Jantine] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Publ Hlth Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Roelefs, Caspar David] Univ Groningen, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Sci & Soc, Groningen, Netherlands; [Schuit, Albertine Jantine] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, Bilthoven, Netherlands";"Kok, MO (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Kok, MO (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Publ Hlth Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands.";m.o.kok@vu.nl;Schuit, Albertine J/I-3148-2018;Schuit, Jantine/0000-0002-7499-1391;SOR programme of the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health;This work was supported by the SOR programme of the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health.;;38;2;2;0;0;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;1478-4505;;;HEALTH RES POLICY SY;Health Res.

During 2015-2016, the Learning Community included multidisciplinary, multi-agency teams of state health officials, payers, clinicians, and health department staff from 13 states. This qualitative study was conducted to better understand the successes, challenges, and strategies that the 13 US states in the Learning Community used for increasing access to immediate postpartum LARC. Methods: We conducted telephone interviews with each team in the Learning Community. Interviews were semi-structured and organized by the eight domains of the Learning Community. We coded transcribed interviews for facilitators, barriers, and implementation strategies, using a recent compilation of expert-defined implementation strategies as a foundation for coding the latter. Results: Data analysis showed three ways that the activities of the Learning Community helped in policy implementation work: structure and accountability, validity, and preparing for potential challenges and opportunities. Further, the qualitative data demonstrated that the Learning Community integrated six other implementation strategies from the literature: organize clinician implementation team meetings, conduct educational meetings, facilitation, promote network weaving, provide ongoing consultation, and distribute educational materials. Conclusions: Convening a multi-state learning collaborative is a promising approach for facilitating the implementation of new reimbursement policies for evidence-based practices complicated by systems challenges. By integrating several implementation strategies, the Learning Community serves as a meta-strategy for supporting implementation.;"[DeSisto, Carla L.; Rankin, Kristin M.] Univ Illinois, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol & Biostat, 1603 Taylor St,M-C 923, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Estrich, Cameron] Univ Illinois, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Community Hlth Sci, 1603 Taylor St,M-C 923, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Kroelinger, Charlan D.; Goodman, David A.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Chron Dis Prevent & Hlth Promot, Maternal & Child Hlth Epidemiol Program, Div Reprod Hlth, 4770 Buford Hwy NE,MS F74, Chamblee, GA 30341 USA; [Pliska, Ellen; Mackie, Christine N.; Waddell, Lisa F.] Assoc State & Terr Hlth Officials, 2231 Crystal Dr,Suite 450, Arlington, VA 22202 USA";DeSisto, CL (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol & Biostat, 1603 Taylor St,M-C 923, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.;cdesis2@uic.edu;Estrich, Cameron/AAA-9305-2020;Estrich, Cameron/0000-0001-6156-5177;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Building Capacity in Maternal and Child Health Programs [1U38OT000161];This research was made possible through funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Building Capacity in Maternal and Child Health Programs (Cooperative Agreement 1U38OT000161).;;25;4;4;0;2;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;1748-5908;;;IMPLEMENT SCI;Implement.

However, use of ligand-based approaches can lead to erroneous predictions when structural and dynamic features of the target substantially affect ligand binding. Free energy methods for affinity computation can include steric and electrostatic protein-ligand interactions, solvent effects, and thermal fluctuations, but often they are computationally demanding and require a high level of supervision. As a result their application is typically limited to the screening of small sets of compounds by experts in molecular modeling. Results: We have developed eTOX ALLIES, an open source framework that allows the automated prediction of ligand-binding free energies requiring the ligand structure as only input. eTOX ALLIES is based on the linear interaction energy approach, an efficient end-point free energy method derived from Free Energy Perturbation theory. Upon submission of a ligand or dataset of compounds, the tool performs the multiple steps required for binding free-energy prediction (docking, ligand topology creation, molecular dynamics simulations, data analysis), making use of external open source software where necessary. Moreover, functionalities are also available to enable and assist the creation and calibration of new models. In addition, a web graphical user interface has been developed to allow use of free-energy based models to users that are not an expert in molecular modeling. Conclusions: Because of the user-friendliness, efficiency and free-software licensing, eTOX ALLIES represents a novel extension of the toolbox for computational chemists, pharmaceutical scientists and toxicologists, who are interested in fast affinity predictions of small molecules toward biological (off-) targets for which protein flexibility, solvent and binding site interactions directly affect the strength of ligand-protein binding.;"[Capoferri, Luigi; van Dijk, Marc; Rustenburg, Arien S.; Wassenaar, Tsjerk A.; Kooi, Derk P.; Rifai, Eko A.; Vermeulen, Nico P.

To compare various surgical approaches we recruited 12 raters to evaluate 429 patients. Expert and lay raters judged photographs from patients, who have completed treatment with one of three different surgical strategies performed in our institution over 50 years. Facial photographs were cropped, presented to the raters in a randomized sequence, and judged by the raters on a 5 point Likert scale. The subjective ratings between the raters revealed a fair to substantial inter-rater reliability. The average ratings of the surgical outcome improved continuously over the investigated 5 decades. Despite possible differences between raters and rater groups this overall result was consistently seen in the gender groups (male/hfemale), or expertise related groups (expert/lay).

However, admission centers (spokes) are subject to financial charges which can make them reluctant to join the system. We implemented and assessed an economic model supporting our telestroke system, Virtuall, France, which includes one expert center (hub) and six spokes. Methods: The model is based on payment for the expertise provided by the hub, distribution of charges related to telemedicine according to the fees perceived by the spokes, and transfer of patients between the spokes and the hub. We performed a cost-benefit analysis for all patients included in Virtuall from January 2014 to December 2015 to assess the economic balance in each center. Results: 321 patients were prospectively included in the study. Application of the economic model resulted in overall financial balance with funding of a dedicated medical service in the hub, and reduced costs directly related to telestroke by an average of 10% in the spokes. The conditions generating the highest costs for the spokes were: a patient returning from the hub for re-hospitalization (mean cost of $1,995/patient); management of patients treated by intravenous thrombolysis without transfer to the hub (mean cost of $2,075/patient). The most favorable financial condition for the spokes remained simple transfer of patients to the hub and no return (mean cost of $329/patient). Conclusion: We describe an economic model which can be applied to any telestroke system to ensure the optimal balance between hub and spoke centers.";"[Riou-Comte, Nolwenn; Mione, Gioia; Humbertjean, Lisa; Debouverie, Marc; Richard, Sebastien] Univ Hosp Nancy, Dept Neurol, Stroke Unit, Nancy, France; [Brunner, Arielle] Agence Reg Sante, Nancy, France; [Vezain, Arnaud] GCS Telesante Lorraine, Villers Les Nancy, France; [Lavandier, Karine] Hosp Bar Le Duc, Bar Le Duc, France; [Marchal, Sophie] Hosp Verdun, Verdun, France; [Bracard, Serge] Univ Hosp Nancy, Dept Neuroradiol, Nancy, France; [Richard, Sebastien] Univ Hosp Nancy, CIC P 1433, INSERM, U1116, Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France";"Richard, S (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Nancy, Dept Neurol, Stroke Unit, Nancy, France.; Richard, S (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Nancy, CIC P 1433, INSERM, U1116, Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.";s.richard@chru-nancy.fr;;;;;;26;1;1;0;2;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;1664-2295;;;FRONT NEUROL;Front.

Optimistically, plant managers assess their plant efficiency once or twice per year. Consequently, the time gap between an inefficiency and its detection produces avoidable operational costs. Although the installation of multiple on-line sensors can provide detailed energy information, for a human operator it is unrealistic to analyse the produced data in a satisfactory time-scale. This paper proposes a cooperative tool for energy saving that remotely accesses and evaluates WWTP databases to produce daily energy assessment reports. The novelty of this decision support tool lies in the original combination of: key performance indicators, daily benchmarking, expert knowledge, scenario analysis, fuzzy logic and shared knowledge. In this paper, the Shared Knowledge Decision Support System (SK-DSS) concept is presented and the methodology demonstrated and validated on the energy consumption of biological aeration systems.

The objective of this work is to evaluate five scenarios for the Brazilian power sector until 2050 using a multi-criteria decision analysis tool. These scenarios include a baseline trend and low carbon policy scenarios based on carbon taxes and carbon emission limits. To support the applied methodology, a questionnaire was elaborated to integrate the perceptions of experts on the scenario evaluation process. Considering the results from multi-criteria analysis, scenario preference followed the order of increasing share of renewables in the power sector. The preferable option for the future Brazilian power sector is a scenario where wind and biomass have a major contribution. The robustness of the multi-criteria tool applied in this study was tested by a sensitivity analysis. This analysis demonstrated that, regardless of the respondents' preferences and backgrounds, scenarios with higher shares of fossil fuel sources are the least preferable option, while scenarios with major contributions from wind and biomass are the preferable option to supply electricity in Brazil through 2050.

This paper addresses both the economic and social dimensions of low carbon emissions by analysing the presence of socio-environmental conflicts in Germany. These conflicts appear to be a consequence of unsustainable policies targeting firms' planning and behaviour, mainly based on neoclassical economic thinking and various stakeholder groups that oppose carbon intensive businesses. By applying a Delphi Method with 18 experts, the authors analyse 117 socio-environmental conflicts (e.g. derived from extractive activity, energy production, and infrastructure projects) in Germany. Most of these conflicts include the struggle of various society groups to achieve a low carbon economy but also a more equitable society. The analyses presented in this paper shows that Germany provides both the best and the worse of achieving low carbon paths: a significant investment into renewable energy, but also a strong dependency on lignite which supplies the most polluting power stations of Europe. By addressing the problem from a historical perspective, the authors demonstrate how carbon intensive extractive activity has been one of the major causes for environmental activism and protest in both socialist and capitalist societies.

Within the Netherlands the LOTOS-EUROS model has been developed by a consortium of institutes, after combining its independently developed predecessors in 2005. Recently, version 2.0 of the model was released as an open-source version. This paper presents the curriculum vitae of the model system, describing the model's history, model philosophy, basic features and a validation with EMEP stations for the new benchmark year 2012, and presents cases with the model's most recent and key developments. By setting the model developments in context and providing an outlook for directions for further development, the paper goes beyond the common model description. With an origin in ozone and sulfur modelling for the models LOTOS and EUROS, the application areas were gradually extended with persistent organic pollutants, reactive nitrogen, and primary and secondary particulate matter. After the combination of the models to LOTOS-EUROS in 2005, the model was further developed to include new source parametrizations (e.g. road resuspension, desert dust, wildfires), applied for operational smog forecasts in the Netherlands and Europe, and has been used for emission scenarios, source apportionment, and long-term hindcast and climate change scenarios. LOTOS-EUROS has been a front-runner in data assimilation of ground-based and satellite observations and has participated in many model intercomparison studies. The model is no longer confined to applications over Europe but is also applied to other regions of the world, e.g. China. The increasing interaction with emission experts has also contributed to the improvement of the model's performance. The philosophy for model development has always been to use knowledge that is state of the art and proven, to keep a good balance in the level of detail of process description and accuracy of input and output, and to keep a good record on the effect of model changes using benchmarking and validation. The performance of v2.0 with respect to EMEP observations is good, with spatial correlations around 0.8 or higher for concentrations and wet deposition. Temporal correlations are around 0.5 or higher. Recent innovative applications include source apportionment and data assimilation, particle number modelling, and energy transition scenarios including corresponding land use changes as well as Saharan dust forecasting. Future developments would enable more flexibility with respect to model horizontal and vertical resolution and further detailing of model input data. This includes the use of different sources of land use characterization (roughness length and vegetation), detailing of emissions in space and time, and efficient coupling to meteorology from different meteorological models.;"[Manders, Astrid M.

Thus, medical students require adequate preparation in communication skills. For research purposes, as well as for evaluation in teaching, there is a clear need for reliable assessment tools. We analyzed the shortcomings of existing instruments and saw a need for a new rating scale. The aim of this publication is to describe the development process for, and evaluation of, a new rating scale. Methods: First, we developed the rating scale in 10 steps. Then, two raters evaluated the newly developed rating scale by rating 135 videotaped consultations of medical students with standardized patients. Additionally, standardized patients evaluated students' performance, which was used as an outside criterion to validate ratings. Results: Our rating scale comprises six domains with 13 specific items evaluated on a five-point Likert scale: initiating conversation, patient's perception, structure of conversation, patient's emotions, end of conversation, and general communication skills. Item-total correlation coefficients between the checklist items ranged from 0.15 to 0.78. Subscale consistency was calculated for domains comprised of more than one item and Cronbach's alpha >= 0.77, indicating acceptable consistency. Standardized patients' global evaluation correlated moderately with overall expert ratings (Spearman's rho = .40, p < .001). Conclusion: Our rating scale is a reliable and applicable assessment tool. The rating scale focuses on the evaluation of general communication skills and can be applied in research as well as in evaluations, such as objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE).;"[Radziej, K.; Sattel, H.; Dinkel, A.] Tech Univ Munich, Psychosomat Med & Psychotherapy, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Munich, Germany; [Loechner, J.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat Psychotherapy &, Munich, Germany; [Engerer, C.; Berberat, P.

Although the dramatic reductions in the costs facilitate the use in the wet-lab and clinics, the huge amount of data generated renders their management by non-expert researchers and physicians extremely difficult. Therefore, there is an urgent need of novel approaches and tools aimed at getting the 'end-users' closer to the sequencing data, facilitating the access by non-bioinformaticians, and to speed-up the functional interpretation of genetic variants. We developed myVCF, a standalone, easy-to-use desktop application, which is based on a browser interface and is suitable for Windows, Mac and UNIX systems. myVCF is an efficient platform that is able to manage multiple sequencing projects created from VCF files within the system; stores genetic variants and samples genotypes from an annotated VCF files into a SQLite database; implements a flexible search engine for data exploration, allowing to query for chromosomal region, gene, single variant or dbSNP ID. Besides, myVCF generates a summary statistics report about mutations distribution across samples and across the genome/exome by aggregating the information within the VCF file. In summary, the myVCF platform allows end-users without strong programming and bioinformatics skills to explore, query, visualize and export mutations data in a simple and straightforward way.

Biodiesel proves to be a good alternative for fossil fuels. But sustainability of biodiesel is the key factor for determining it as a fuel in diesel engines. It needs identification of proper blend of biodiesel and diesel to meet the efficiency, engine suitability and environmental acceptability. Alternative fuel blend evaluation in IC engine fuel technologies is a very important strategic decision tool involving balancing between a number of criteria such as performance, emission and combustion parameters and opinions from different decision maker of IC engine experts. Hence, it is a MCDM. problem. This paper describes the application of hybrid Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques for the selection of optimum biodiesel blend in IC engine. FAHP-TOPSIS, FAHP-VIKOR and FAHP-ELECTRE, are the three methods that are used to evaluate the best blend. The performances of these MCDM methods are also compared with each other. Here, FAHP is used to determine the relative weights of the criteria, whereas TOPSIS, VIKOR and ELECTRE are used for obtaining the final ranking of alternatives. A single cylinder, constant speed and direct injection diesel engine with a rated output of 4.4 kW is used for exploratory analysis of evaluation criteria at different load conditions. Diesel, B20, B40, B60, B80 and B100 fuel blends are prepared by varying the proportion of biodiesel. Similarly, Brake thermal efficiency (BTE), Exhaust gas temperature (EGT), Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), Smoke, Hydrocarbon (HC), Carbon monoxide (CO), Carbon dioxide (CO2), Ignition Delay, Combustion Duration and Maximum Rate of Pressure Rise are considered as the evaluation criteria. The ranking of alternatives obtained by FAHP-TOPSIS, FAHP-VIKOR and FAHP-ELECTRE are B20 > Diesel > B40 > B60 > B80 > B100 for 21 degrees bTDC and 24 degrees bTDC and Diesel > B20 > B40 > B60 > B80 > B100 for 27 degrees bTDC. It shows that B20 is ranked first for 21 degrees bTDC and 24 degrees bTDC and second for 27 degrees bTDC injection timing. Hence, it is concluded that mixing 20% biodiesel with diesel is suggested as a good replacement for diesel. This paper provides a new insight of applying MCDM techniques to evaluate the best fuel blend by decision makers such as engine manufactures and R&D engineers to meet the fuel economy and emission norms to empower green revolution.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the results of our minimally invasive technique for Achilles tendon repair using a simple ovarian clamp for suture guiding. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture were treated with minimally invasive repair by an expert orthopaedic surgeon. Instead of an Achillon device, an ovarian clamp was directed to the proximal and distal parts of the Achilles tendon. All data relating to daily activities, walking, climbing stairs, sports activity, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) and Thermannscores were recorded. Sural nerve was evaluated with physical examination for paraesthesia, hyperaesthesia, lateralis cruris and foot pain in all patient controls. Results: The average AOFAS score was 97.06 (76-100). All patients had intact Achilles tendon at last control. No rerupture was observed. Average time taken to return to work was 30.8 days (28-60 days). After 6 months, all patients returned to their previous sports activities. Conclusion: For Achilles tendon ruptures, minimally invasive repair techniques have shown successful results with low complication rates. Besides their success, some suture-guiding devices bring extra costs for patients or health insurance. Minimally invasive techniques may be performed with devices without any extra cost. Our new suture-guiding device provides knot placement under paratenon like Achillon device to improve outcomes, provides early return to work and minimizes the complications. Finally, our suture-guiding device has no extra cost.;"[Obut, Sinan; Gultekin, Alper; Serarslan, Ulas] Derince Res Hosp, Orthopaed & Traumatol Dept, Kocaeli, Turkey; [Unal, Meric] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Med, Sports Med Dept, TR-32200 Isparta, Turkey; [Tuhanioglu, Umit] Adana Numune EAH, Orthopaed & Traumatol Dept, Adana, Turkey";Unal, M (corresponding author), Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Med, Sports Med Dept, TR-32200 Isparta, Turkey.;abdmunal@yahoo.com;;;;;;26;0;0;0;1;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;2309-4990;;;J ORTHOP SURG-HONG K;J.

It is demonstrated that, however, the current measurements used for navigation during Mars entry cannot guarantee the complete observability of the dynamic system. This paper proposes an integrated navigation scheme for Mars entry phase using the dynamic pressure and accelerations from inertial measurement unit (IMU). The dynamic pressure derived from the Mars Entry Atmospheric Data System (MEADS), and the triaxle accelerations from IMU are integrated in a filter as navigation measurements to increase the dynamic system observability and perform state estimation on-board. Afterward, the perturbation of the dynamic caused by parameter uncertainties is built. In order to address the impact of perturbation on state estimation, an adaptive estimator based on modified mixture-of-expert framework is given. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed integrated navigation scheme can ensure the complete observability of the dynamic system, and the state estimation are converged with entry time after the dynamic pressure has built up.

The proposed CBR approach enables analyzing the history of previous cases of energy reduction in buildings, and using them to provide a suggestion on the ideal level of energy reduction that should be applied in the consumption of houses. The innovations of the proposed CBR model are the application of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (k-NN) clustering algorithm to identify similar past cases, the adaptation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) meta-heuristic optimization method to optimize the choice of the variables that characterize each case, and the development of expert systems to adapt and refine the final solution. A case study is presented, which considers a knowledge base containing a set of scenarios obtained from the consumption of a residential building. In order to provide a response for a new case, the proposed CBR application selects the most similar cases and elaborates a response, which is provided to the SCADA House Intelligent Management (SHIM) system as input data. SHIM uses this specification to determine the loads that should be reduced in order to fulfill the reduction suggested by the CBR approach. Results show that the proposed approach is capable of suggesting the most adequate levels of reduction for the considered house, without compromising the comfort of the users. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, considerable interest has been given to their optimized management during their service life due to a large increase in the number of new renewable energy source power plants. High reliability levels are as important as high yields in order to maximize the useful green energy produced. Solar energy has been one of the most popular and exploited renewable sources in the market and therefore improvements in its efficiency and reliability have had a considerable impact. All energy systems require an increase in their conversion efficiency to reduce the consumption of primary energy. Moreover, the optimization of the performance of photovoltaic systems has increased their incidence as renewable sources in global power generation and has boosted their profitability. A failure of the components and sub-components of a working energy system cause two main issues; the first direct implication for the plant is the damage of the components and sub-components, and the second indirect implication is the consequent lack of energy production due to the plant being out of order. Furthermore, unforeseen failures of the components increase the uncontrollability of photovoltaic power systems, which worsens electric grid dispatching. The work presented here provides, for the first time, a complete and new assessment of Reliability Centered Maintenance carried out using a failure mode and effect analysis approach to photovoltaic systems. We use a large volume of data derived from a database of real maintenance activities carried out by a multinational company. These data were interpreted by the opinions of experts with specialist experience in the installation, operation, and maintenance of photovoltaic power systems, from small to multi-megawatt size. The present work here has advantages over many previous studies since the information was derived from real experiences of photovoltaic systems which allowed for a more realistic risk analysis and, especially, this information was also used to revise the maintenance plan of photovoltaic installations and to optimize their effectiveness, concentrating on various failure modes which mostly affect production or which can be easily removed/reduced.";"[Villarini, Mauro] Tuscia Univ Viterbo, Dept Sci & Technol Agr Forestry Nat & Energy, Viterbo, Italy; [Cesarotti, Vittorio; Alfonsi, Lucrezia; Introna, Vito] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Enterprise Engn, Rome, Italy";Villarini, M (corresponding author), Tuscia Univ Viterbo, Dept Sci & Technol Agr Forestry Nat & Energy, Viterbo, Italy.;"mauro.villarini@unitus.it; cesarotti@uniroma2.it; vito.introna@uniroma2.it";;"Villarini, Mauro/0000-0001-8586-5115; introna, vito/0000-0003-0968-9863";;;;61;19;19;1;13;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0196-8904;1879-2227;;ENERG CONVERS MANAGE;Energy Conv.

An automatic selection of the clustering classification algorithm is also highlighted. Finally, new customers can be assigned to a predefined set of clusters in the classification phase. The computation time of the proposed framework is less than that of previous classification techniques, which enables the processing of a complete electric company sample in a matter of minutes on a personal computer. The high accuracy of the predicted classification results verifies the performance of the clustering technique.

It also created new challenges to handle resource allocation and power optimization of User Equipment (UE). The paper explores radio resource allocation and power consumption problem of UE in LTE environment. An intelligent scheduling scheme developed is based on Cooperative Game Theory (CGT) method and AHP-TOPSIS method. It distributes resources in a fair way among a number of applications and UE are prioritized based on certain criteria like delay, throughput history, UE buffer space and channel conditions and preferences. In LTE, Discontinuous Reception (DRX) has been adopted to conserve the battery life of UE. DRX periodically switches off the radio interfaces to conserve the battery life but it may breach Quality of Service (QoS). Therefore, the DRX parameters need to be further optimized to satisfy QoS and minimize power consumption of UE. DRX parameters are dynamically adjusted on the basis of current load and channel condition of the network. Power saving operations are numerically analyzed. Simulation results show that the expert and an intelligent system can distribute resources in a fair way among UE, improves the battery consumption of UE up to 85% and packets transmission delay by 10% as compared to existing scheme for real-time applications.

The procedure utilizes opinions from multiple experts in the creation of a stream of consensual yearly cash-flows for each patent. The cash-flow stream is used as an input in continuous-time real option valuation of each patent. Continuous time analysis of the patents allows for optimizing the timing of dropping patents from the portfolio. The procedure is relatively easy to apply in a practical setting, and is consistent with financial theory. Using the procedure is illustrated with a numerical example. Ranking result sensitivity to parameter value selection is studied separately. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It requires time consuming manual examination of cell images by a cytogeneticist to distinguish chromosome classes from each other. Thus, a reliable autonomous human chromosome classification system not only saves time and money but also reduces errors due to the inadequate knowledge level of the expert. Human cell contains 23 pairs of chromosome, 22 autosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes. Hence, we face a multi-class classification task which represents a challenging case for any sort of classifier. In this work, to solve this classification problem, we propose a novel methodology consisting two stages: (i) data preparation and training, and (ii) testing. To determine the most informative content of the dataset several preliminary experiments are conducted and a Principal Component Analysis is done. Then, a single Support Vector Machine (SVMij) is trained to separate a pair of classes, (i,j) where a numerical optimization method Pattern Search (PS), is employed to find the optimal parameters for the SVMij. Considering 22 pairs of autosomes, 22 x 22 experts are trained and optimized. The cluster of experts, we obtain is named as Competitive SVM Teams (CSVMTs) where each SVMij competes with the others to label a new classification instance. The final output of the classifier is determined by majority voteing. The results obtained on Copenhagen dataset proves the merit of the algorithm as correct classification rates (CRR) on train and test samples are 99.55% and 97.84% respectively, which are higher than any accuracy rate achieved so far in the related literature.

This is why contemporary research is now focused on seeking mechanisms able to produce software quality models that can be easily adjusted to custom user needs. In this context, we introduce QATCH, an integrated framework that applies static analysis to benchmark repositories in order to generate software quality models tailored to stakeholder specifications. Fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making is employed in order to model the uncertainty imposed by experts' judgments. These judgments can be expressed into linguistic values, which makes the process more intuitive. Furthermore, a robust software quality model, the base model, is generated by the system, which is used in the experiments for QATCH system verification. The paper provides an extensive analysis of QATCH and thoroughly discusses its validity and added value in the field of software quality through a number of individual experiments.

J;"Zedan, H; Al-Sultan, S";;;;"Zedan, Hussein; Al-Sultan, Saif";;;The specification and design of secure context-aware workflows;EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Workflows; Context-aware; Security; Specification";"ONTOLOGY; CALCULUS";There are two major concerns in the development of current workflow system. The first is security considerations and the second is context awareness. Modern workflow systems cross the boundaries of organisations, each may have its own security requirements, policies and constraints. Even within one organisation, activities in a workflow system may be executed, in one of its instances, within a platform, but in another instance it may be executed or performed on a different platform with completely different environment. Indeed it may not even be automated. This lends modern workflow systems to be security and context-critical. This is in addition to the fact that some of its activities must satisfy variety of hard timing constraints. Current specification and design languages for workflow systems are inadequate in dealing with context aware secure workflows. This paper presents a sound wide-spectrum language, CS - Flow, for the specification and design of context-aware, secure workflow systems. As workflow systems have strong temporal aspects (e.g. activity sequencing, deadline, scheduling constraints, etc.), the proposed CS - Flow is equipped with a rich set of temporal constructs together with temporal proof rules which can be used to be integrated with temporal expert systems, hence enhancing the capabilities of current workflow software. In addition, CS - Flow is supported by a proof system which underpins the workflow engine that provides decision service using its state to make some decision and update the workflow state. CS - Flow therefore provides a sound linkage between expert systems and workflow engines. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A terminology catalogue (TC) was embedded into the system, with interfaces allowing to replicate and to manually work on terminologies. For data ingest and archiving, we show how the TC can improve structuring and harmonizing lineage and content descriptions of data sets. Key is the conceptualization of measurement and observation types (parameters) and methods, for which we have implemented a basic syntax and rule set. For data access and dissemination, we have improved findability of data through enrichment of metadata with TC terms. Semantic annotations, e.g. adding term concepts (including synonyms and hierarchies) or mapped terms of different terminologies, facilitate comprehensive data retrievals. The PANGAEA thesaurus of classifying terms, which is part of the TC is used as an umbrella vocabulary that links the various domains and allows drill downs and side drills with various facets. Furthermore, we describe how TC terms can be linked to nominal data values. This improves data harmonization and facilitates structural transformation of heterogeneous data sets to a common schema. Technical developments are complemented by work on the metadata content. Over the last 20 years, more than 100 new parameters have been defined on average per week. Recently, PANGAEA has increasingly been submitting new terms to various terminology services. Matching terms from terminology services with our parameter or method strings is supported programmatically. However, the process ultimately needs manual input by domain experts. The quality of terminology services is an additional limiting factor, and varies with respect to content, editorial, interoperability, and sustainability. Good quality terminology services are the building blocks for the conceptualization of parameters and methods. In our view, they are essential for data interoperability and arguably the most difficult hurdle for data integration. In summary, the application of terminologies has a mutual positive effect for terminology services and information systems such as PANGAEA. On both sides, the application of terminologies improves content, reliability and interoperability.;"[Diepenbroek, Michael; Schindler, Uwe; Huber, Robert; Pesant, Stephane; Stocker, Markus; Felden, Janine; Buss, Melanie; Weinrebe, Matthias] Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, PANGAEA Data Publisher Earth Environm Sci, POB 33 04 40, D-28334 Bremen, Germany";Diepenbroek, M (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, MARUM Ctr Marine Environm Sci, PANGAEA Data Publisher Earth Environm Sci, POB 33 04 40, D-28334 Bremen, Germany.;"mdiepenbroek@pangaea.de; uschindler@pangaea.de; rhuber@uni-bremen.de; spesant@marum.de; mstocker@marum.de; jfelden@marum.de; mbuss@marum.de";Stocker, Markus/K-2993-2013;"Stocker, Markus/0000-0001-5492-3212; Schindler, Uwe/0000-0002-1900-4162; PESANT, Stephane/0000-0002-4936-5209";;;;22;3;3;1;8;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0168-1656;1873-4863;;J BIOTECHNOL;J.

Three types of technologies are currently fighting the battle for standard dominance: combustion, pyrolysis, and gasification. Twelve relevant factors for standard dominance were found: 'financial strength', 'operational supremacy', 'learning orientation', 'technological superiority', 'compatibility', 'flexibility', 'pricing strategy', 'distribution strategy', 'previous installed base', 'regulator', 'effectiveness of the format development process', and 'network of stakeholders'. Applying expert opinions and the Best-Worst Method (BWM), the relative importance (weights) of these factors were calculated. The weights were then used to evaluate and rank the technologies. The results show that biomass gasification has the highest chance of achieving standard dominance and that technological superiority is the most important factor affecting standard success. The weights per factor were explained and theoretical contributions and areas for future research were discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

SEAD is an agent-based model whose rules are set to mimic the human decision making processes regarding agricultural land expansion. Model calibration is based on remotely sensed data. Detection of agricultural lands was executed using intraand inter-annual Landsat images, with an overall accuracy of 86%. An analysis regarding the correlation of agricultural spread with water availability, irrigation infrastructure, road infrastructure, soil type, and geographical variables was conducted. These data, along with interviews with agricultural experts examining farmers' decision-making processes, were translated into rules that were used to model agricultural expansion. The SEAD results show that agricultural expansion in the north-western Negev (Israel) is highly dependent on water availability, which in turn is sensitive to forecasted climate change scenarios. While the spatial expansion patterns are mostly influenced by irrigation and road infrastructure positioning and placement, they vary in their infrastructural costs and agricultural settlement clustering and connectivity, thus affecting landscape fragmentation, travel time, and social/ecological connectivity. SEAD, being highly encapsulated and object-oriented in nature, can be reused in different settings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Besides handling bi-directional reasoning, a major benefit of this degradation model using a DBN is its ability to adequately model stochastic processes as well as Markov chains. We will assume that the behavior of the degradation can be represented as a P-F-curve (also called degradation or life curve). The model developed here is able to combine information from expert knowledge, any kind of sensor and operating data as well as information from the machine operator. Using the Bayesian approach, uncertain knowledge can be handled appropriately. Thus it is even possible to take into account the environment and stress under which the component or system is operating. Hence, it is possible to detect potential failures at an early stage and initiate appropriate remedy and repair strategies prior to catastrophic failure.;"[Lorenzoni, Anselm; Kempf, Michael; Mannuss, Oliver] Fraunhofer Inst Mfg Engn & Automat IPA, Dept Sustainable Prod & Qual Management, Nobelstr 12, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany";Lorenzoni, A (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Mfg Engn & Automat IPA, Dept Sustainable Prod & Qual Management, Nobelstr 12, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.;anselm.lorenzoni@ipa.fraunhofer.de;Lorenzoni, Anselm/AAN-4058-2020;;European Commission within Project Health Monitoring and Life-Long Capability Management for Self-Sustaining Manufacturing Systems (SelSus);This work was supported by the European Commission (Horizon 2020) within the Project Health Monitoring and Life-Long Capability Management for Self-Sustaining Manufacturing Systems (SelSus).;;19;2;2;0;1;TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS;OSLO;KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY;2331-1916;;;COGENT ENG;Cogent Eng.;NOV 9;2017;4;1;;;;;;;1395786;10.1080/23311916.2017.1395786;;;12;Engineering, Multidisciplinary;Engineering;FQ9HG;WOS:000418672500001;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-02-18;

Despite the supply chain knowledge and expertise that ministries of health might glean from other industries, limited empirical research has examined the process of knowledge transfer from other industries into global public health. We examined a partnership designed to improve the availability of medical supplies in Tanzania by transferring knowledge from The Coca-Cola system to Tanzania's Medical Stores Department (MSD). We conducted a process evaluation including in-depth interviews with 70 participants between July 2011 and May 2014, corresponding to each phase of the partnership, with focus on challenges and strategies to address them, as well as benefits perceived by partners. Partners faced challenges in (1) identifying relevant knowledge to transfer, (2) translating operational solutions from Coca-Cola to MSD, and (3) maintaining momentum between project phases. Strategies to respond to these challenges emerged through real-time problem solving and included (1) leveraging the receptivity of MSD leadership, (2) engaging a boundary spanner to identify knowledge to transfer, (3) promoting local recognition of commonalities across industries, (4) engaging external technical experts to manage translation activities, (5) developing tools with visible benefits for MSD, (6) investing in local relationships, and (7) providing time and space for the partnership model to evolve. Benefits of the partnership perceived by MSD staff included enhanced collaboration and communication, more proactive orientations in managing operations, and greater attention to performance management. Benefits perceived by Coca-Cola staff included strengthened knowledge transfer capability and enhanced job satisfaction. Linking theoretical constructs with practical experiences from the field, we highlight the challenges, emergent strategies, and perceived benefits of a partnership across industry boundaries that may be useful to others seeking to promote the transfer of knowledge to improve global health.;"[Linnander, Erika; Yuan, Christina T.; Ahmed, Shirin; Cherlin, Emily; Talbert-Slagle, Kristina; Curry, Leslie A.] Yale Global Hlth Leadership Inst, New Haven, CT 06519 USA; [Linnander, Erika; Yuan, Christina T.; Ahmed, Shirin; Cherlin, Emily; Curry, Leslie A.] Yale Sch Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Talbert-Slagle, Kristina] Yale Sch Med, New Haven, CT USA";"Linnander, E (corresponding author), Yale Global Hlth Leadership Inst, New Haven, CT 06519 USA.; Linnander, E (corresponding author), Yale Sch Publ Hlth, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.";Erka.linnander@yale.edu;;;Coca-Cola Company;"Funding for this study was provided by the Coca-Cola Company.

This article aims to examine whether the principles of the voluntary WHO Global Code of Practice can be applied to trigger health policy decisions within the EU zone of free movement of persons. Methods: In the framework of the Joint Action on European Health Workforce Planning and Forecasting project (Grant Agreement: JA EUHWF 20122201 (see healthworkforce. eu)), focus group discussions were organised with over 30 experts representing ministries, universities and professional and international organisations. Ideas were collected about the applicability of the principles and with the aim to find EU law compatible, relevant solutions using a qualitative approach based on a standardised, semi-structured interview guide and pre-defined statements. Results: Based on implementation practices summarised, focus group experts concluded that positive effects of adhering to the Code can be identified and useful ideas-compatible with EU law-exist to manage intra-EU mobility. The most relevant areas for intervention include bilateral cooperations, better use of EU financial resources, improved retention and integration policies and better data flow and monitoring. Improving retention is of key importance; however, ethical considerations should also apply within the EU. Compensation of source countries can be a solution to further elaborate on when developing EU financial mechanisms. Intra-EU circular mobility might be feasible and made more transparent if directed by tailor-made, institutional-level bilateral cooperations adjusted to different groups and profiles of health professionals. Integration policies should be improved as discrimination still exists when offering jobs despite the legal environment facilitating the recognition of professional qualifications. A system of feedback on registration/licencing data should be promoted providing for more evidence on intra-EU mobility and support its management. Conclusions: Workforce planning in EU Member States can be supported, and more equitable distribution of the workforce can be provided by building policy decisions on the principles of the WHO Code. Political commitment has to be strengthened in EU countries to adopt implementation solutions for intra-EU problems. Long-term benefits of respecting global principles of the Code should be better demonstrated in order to incentivise all parties to follow such long-term objectives.";"[Kovacs, Reka; Girasek, Edmond; Kovacs, Eszter; Aszalos, Zoltan; Eke, Edit; Ragany, Karoly; Cserhati, Zoltan; Szocska, Miklos] Semmelweis Univ, Hlth Serv Management Training Ctr, Kutvolgyi Ut 2, Budapest, Hungary";Kovacs, R (corresponding author), Semmelweis Univ, Hlth Serv Management Training Ctr, Kutvolgyi Ut 2, Budapest, Hungary.;reka.kovacs@emk.sote.hu;Cserhati, Zoltan/AAD-2983-2020;;"European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [JA EUHWF 20122201]; Joint Action on European Health Workforce Planning and Forecasting project [JA EUHWF 20122201]";The article is based on a research conducted as part of the Joint Action on European Health Workforce Planning and Forecasting (JA EUHWF 20122201) project co-financed by the European Commission.;;22;2;2;0;9;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;1478-4491;;;HUM RESOUR HEALTH;Hum.

Methods: mrTRG and pTRG were compared in rectal cancer patients from two phase II trials (EXPERT and EXPERT-C). The agreement between radiologist and pathologist was assessed with the weighted k test while the Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival outcomes. Results: One hundred ninety-one patients were included. Median time from completion of neoadjuvant treatment to pre-operative MRI and surgery was 4.1 weeks (interquartile range (IQR): 3.7-4.7) and 6.6 weeks (IQR: 5.9-7.6), respectively. Fair agreement was found between mrTRG and pTRG when regression was classified according to standard five-tier systems (kappa = 0.24) or modified three-tier systems (kappa = 0.25). Sensitivity and specificity of mrTRG 1-2 (complete/good radiological regression) for the prediction of pathological complete response was 74.4% (95% CI: 58.8-86.5) and 62.8% (95% CI: 54.5-70.6), respectively. Survival outcomes of patients with intermediate pathological regression (pTRG 2) were numerically better if complete/good regression was also observed on imaging (mrTRG 1-2) compared to poor regression (mrTRG 3-5) (5-year recurrence-free survival 76.9% vs 65.9%, P = 0.18; 5-year overall survival 80.6% vs 68.8%, P = 0.22). Conclusions: The agreement between mrTRG and pTRG is low and mrTRG cannot be used as a surrogate of pTRG. Further studies are warranted to assess the ability of mrTRG to identify pathological complete responders for the adoption of non-operative management strategies and to provide complementary prognostic information to pTRG for better risk-stratification after surgery.";"[Sclafani, Francesco; Cunningham, David; Begum, Ruwaida; Tait, Diana; Thomas, Janet; Oates, Jacqui; Chau, Ian] Royal Marsden NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Med, London, England; [Sclafani, Francesco; Cunningham, David; Begum, Ruwaida; Tait, Diana; Thomas, Janet; Oates, Jacqui; Chau, Ian] Royal Marsden NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Med, Surrey, England; [Brown, Gina; Balyasnikova, Svetlana; Evans, Jessica] Royal Marsden NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Radiol, London, England; [Brown, Gina; Balyasnikova, Svetlana; Evans, Jessica] Royal Marsden NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Radiol, Surrey, England; [Wotherspoon, Andrew; Mendes, Larissa Sena Teixeira] Royal Marsden NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Histopathol, London, England; [Wotherspoon, Andrew; Mendes, Larissa Sena Teixeira] Royal Marsden NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Histopathol, Surrey, England; [Peckitt, Clare] Royal Marsden NHS Fdn Trust, Clin Res & Dev, London, England; [Peckitt, Clare] Royal Marsden NHS Fdn Trust, Clin Res & Dev, Surrey, England; [Tabernero, Josep] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Vall dHebron Univ Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Barcelona, Spain; [Glimelius, Bengt] Uppsala Univ, Sect Expt & Clin Oncol, Dept Immunol Genet & Pathol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Rosello, Susana] Univ Valencia, Biomed Res Inst INCLIVA, Dept Haematol & Med Oncol, Valencia, Spain";"Cunningham, D (corresponding author), Royal Marsden NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Med, London, England.; Cunningham, D (corresponding author), Royal Marsden NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Med, Surrey, England.";david.cunningham@rmh.nhs.uk;"Miquel, Josep Maria/AAG-3508-2019; Chau, Ian/ABC-2023-2020; Tabernero, Josep/AAG-5026-2019; Keranen, Susana Rosello/E-7734-2015";"Chau, Ian/0000-0003-0286-8703; Keranen, Susana Rosello/0000-0003-3915-4130; Balyasnikova, Svetlana/0000-0002-9666-9301; Tabernero, Josep/0000-0002-2495-8139";"National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) at Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust; Institute of Cancer Research; Pelican Cancer Foundation; Sanofi-AventisSanofi-Aventis; Merck Co.Merck & Company; National Institute for Health ResearchNational Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [NF-SI-0515-10045] Funding Source: researchfish";The work was supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and The Institute of Cancer Research.

Diet and physical activity behaviours contribute to this risk, shaped by a system of inter-related factors. This study mapped a systems-based framework of the factors influencing dietary and physical activity behaviours in ethnic minority populations living in Europe, to inform research prioritisation and intervention development. Methods: A concept mapping approach guided by systems thinking was used: i. Preparation (protocol and terminology); ii. Generating a list of factors influencing dietary and physical activity behaviours in ethnic minority populations living in Europe from evidence (systematic mapping reviews) and ` eminence' (89 participants from 24 academic disciplines via brainstorming, an international symposium and expert review) and; iii. Seeking consensus on structuring, rating and clustering factors, based on how they relate to each other; and iv. Interpreting/utilising the framework for research and interventions. Similar steps were undertaken for frameworks developed for the majority European population. Results: Seven distinct clusters emerged for dietary behaviour (containing 85 factors) and 8 for physical activity behaviours (containing 183 factors). Four clusters were similar across behaviours: Social and cultural environment; Social and material resources; Psychosocial; and Migration context. Similar clusters of factors emerged in the frameworks for diet and physical activity behaviours of the majority European population, except for ` migration context'. The importance of factors across all clusters was acknowledged, but their relative importance differed for ethnic minority populations compared with the majority population. Conclusions: This systems-based framework integrates evidence from both expert opinion and published literature, to map the factors influencing dietary and physical activity behaviours in ethnic minority groups. Our findings illustrate that innovative research and complex interventions need to be developed that are sensitive to the needs of ethnic minority populations. A systems approach that encompasses the complexity of the inter-related factors that drive behaviours may inform a more holistic public health paradigm to more effectively reach ethnic minorities living in Europe, as well as the majority host population.";"[Holdsworth, Michelle; Osei-Kwasi, Hibbah Araba; Powell, Katie] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Publ Hlth Sect, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Langoien, Lars Jorun] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Publ Hlth, Amsterdam Publ Hlth Res Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Chastin, Sebastien F.

J;Logan, CA;;;;Logan, Cheryl A.;;;Psychoneurosis beyond Oedipus: neurophysiology, drive conflict, and the resolution of emotional trauma;PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"POLITICS; ORIGINS; DISEASE";"The concept of plasticity infused regenerative approaches to brain science in Switzerland in the mid-twentieth century, shaping a holistic tradition prominent among Zurich's psychiatrists and neurologists. From 1910 to about 1950, they sought to objectify the dynamic unconscious using a psychobiological approach to mental pathology pioneered by the neuroanatomists August Forel and Constantin von Monakow. Little scholarship, however, has explored this tradition. Both Forel and Monakow influenced Rudolf Brun, a Zurich neurologist and ant expert, who championed parallels between biological conflicts measured in social insects and Sigmund Freud's drive energetics. Brun's concept of drive conflict integrated Richard Semon's theory of plastic heredity as species memory with a revision of Monakow to explain mental pathology in the brain. Through them, he proposed the neuropathology underlying Freud's genuine psychoneuroses: those caused by unconscious memories of traumatic experience. This paper uses primary historical sources from the Swiss scientific literature to demonstrate that (1) Brun combined Semon's plastic heredity, Cannon's physiology and Pavlov's conditional reflex to objectify Freud's dynamic unconscious; and (2) though he rejected Monakow's teleology, Brun's holistic mind-body approach owed much to Monakow's theory of emotions and pathology manifest in the brain. Brun elaborated Monakow's view that psychopathology occurs as unconscious drive conflicts produce neurotoxicity, enabling excess hormones to disrupt the brain's protective filtering system. Brun's ant experiments confirmed evolutionary laws governing drive conflict and framed the neuro-energetics underlying the resolution of repressed emotional trauma. Tests pitted conflicts between social drives and those serving self-interest. Through them, Brun extended moral conflict beyond the Oedipal domain of psychoanalysis to encompass conflicts in a biological hierarchy of drives. This drive-based account of conscience explored neural pathways reaching back from the cortex to the body, so enabling traumatic memories to generate psychoneuroses. Plasticity could then justify the use of psychotherapy to reverse these pathogenic connections. Brun's example demonstrates both the significance of Semon's theory of heredity for objective accounts of the unconscious mind in Central Europe and the hidden legacy of Monakow's neuroendocrine holism. Brun combined that legacy with objective evidence and Zurich's emphasis on plasticity to endorse-somewhat paradoxically-the reversal of psychoneuroses in the brain.";[Logan, Cheryl A.] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, POB 26170, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA;Logan, CA (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Greensboro, POB 26170, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA.;calogan@uncg.edu;;;;;;61;3;3;0;1;PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD;BASINGSTOKE;BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND;2055-1045;;;PALGR COMMUN;Palgr.

Flies are expert at navigating cluttered environments, and while their visual processing of rotatory optic flow is understood in exquisite detail, how they process translatory optic flow remains a mystery. We present novel cell types that have local motion receptive fields matched to translation self-motion, the vertical translation (VT) cells. One of these, the VT1 cell, encodes self-motion in the forward-sideslip direction and fires action potentials in spike bursts as well as single spikes. We show that the spike burst coding is size and speed-tuned and is selectively modulated by motion parallax-the relative motion experienced during translation. These properties are spatially organized, so that the cell is most excited by clutter rather than isolated objects. When the fly is presented with a simulation of flying past an elevated object, the spike burst activity is modulated by the height of the object, and the rate of single spikes is unaffected. When the moving object alone is experienced, the cell is weakly driven. Meanwhile, the VT2-3 cells have motion receptive fields matched to the lift axis. In conjunction with previously described horizontal cells, the VT cells have properties well suited to the visual navigation of clutter and to encode the fly's movements along near cardinal axes of thrust, lift, and forward sideslip.;"[Longden, Kit D.; Wicklein, Martina; Hardcastle, Ben J.; Huston, Stephen J.; Krapp, Holger G.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Bioengn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Longden, Kit D.] Reiser Lab, HHMI Janelia Res Campus,19700 Helix Dr, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA; [Wicklein, Martina] UCL, Dept Neurosci Physiol & Pharmacol, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Hardcastle, Ben J.] UCLA, Dept Integrat Biol & Physiol, Frye Lab, 610 Charles Young Dr East, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Huston, Stephen J.] HHMI Janelia Res Campus,19700 Helix Dr, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA";"Longden, KD (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Bioengn, London SW7 2AZ, England.; Longden, KD (corresponding author), Reiser Lab, HHMI Janelia Res Campus,19700 Helix Dr, Ashburn, VA 20147 USA.";longdenk@janelia.hhmi.org;;Hardcastle, Ben/0000-0002-4819-5631;"US Air Force Office of Scientific ResearchUnited States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) [FA8655-09-1-3083]; European Office of Aerospace Research and Development";This work was supported by award FA8655-09-1-3083 to H.G.K. from the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the European Office of Aerospace Research and Development.

It shows the necessity to get an efficient methodology for open innovation in order to build a computer aided tool for inventive design in Process Systems Engineering (PSE). The proposed methodology will be evocated to be fully used in the context of the revolutionary concepts around the so-called factory for the future, also called integrated digital factory, innovative factory... As a result the main contribution of this paperis to propose a software prototype for an Open Computer Aided Innovation 2.0. By definition this open innovation relies on collaboration. This collaboration should enable a community, with a very broad spectrum of skills, to share data, information, knowledge and ideas. As a consequence, a first sub objective is to create a methodological framework that takes advantages of collaboration and collective intelligence(with its capacity to join intelligence and knowledge). Furthermore, the raise of the digital company and more particularly the breakthroughs in information technologies is a powerful enabler to extend and improve the potential of collective intelligence. The second sub objective is to propose a problem resolution process to impel creativity of expert but also to develop, validate and select innovative solutions. After dealing with the importance of Process Innovation and Problem solving investigation in PSE, the proposed approach originally based on an extension of the TRIZ theory (Russian acronym for Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), has been improved by using approach such as case-based reasoning, in order to tackle and revisit problems encountered in the PSE. A case study on biomass is used to illustrate the capabilities of the methodology and the tool. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The number of mobile money users and value of transactions is on the increase. This rapid growth of mobile money services and value transactions in emerging economies is attributed to the light-touch regulatory framework which allows minimal limitations on who should operate mobile money system and few restrictions on who can function as an agent. These increases both in services and transactions indicate that mobile money systems hold a lot of valuable customer financial information that needs to be jealously protected against information breaches and abuse by the various stakeholders in the mobile money ecosystem. Taking an interpretive qualitative approach, Activity Theory (AT) has been used to analyse the mobile money management activities focusing on information security policies, regulations and procedures. In order to comprehend the aspects revealed by the Activity Theory analysis that raise information security management concerns in mobile money operations, Mobile Network Operator (MNO) management issues, in terms of the security of mobile money operations, are detailed. Our findings look at the reasons given by various stakeholders for information security management gaps in mobile money operations in emerging economies.

Initially, these studies were used to support the design process, aiming to develop installations that could be operated safely throughout their lifetime. As installations were put into operation, the studies were updated with as-built and operational information to provide a basis for making decisions also in the operational phase. This was however only partially successful, and the general impression has been that the studies have not been very actively used in operations. Many explanations have been given, the most common being that the reports were too complicated and written for risk analysis experts, not operations personnel on offshore installations and that the results could not be updated sufficiently often to reflect changes in risk on a day-by-day basis. This may be a part of the explanation, but in this paper, we have looked into the decision context and the types of decisions made in operation, compared to those in the design phase. Based on this, it is concluded that the focus of existing models need to be extended to cover activity risk in a more detailed way, as well as the risk associated with the technical systems. Instead, a revised methodology for developing quantitative risk assessments is proposed, focusing on the parameters and activities that change during operation. The methodology has also been tested on an offshore installation, to investigate the feasibility in practice.;"[Haugen, Stein] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Technol, NTNU, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Edwin, Nathaniel John] Safetec Nord AS, Klaebuveien 194, N-7037 Trondheim, Norway";Haugen, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Marine Technol, NTNU, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.;"Stein.haugen@ntnu.no; Nathaniel.john.edwin@safetec.no";;Haugen, Stein/0000-0002-1493-9575;Norwegian Research Council - PETROMAKS2 [228237/E30];The authors wish to acknowledge the Norwegian Research Council for their financial support to the MIRMAP project, No. 228237/E30, funded by PETROMAKS2.

International efforts have been made to develop and to implement data collection, management, and surveillance systems that capture pregnancy-related information that can be assessed and used to improve health and system outcomes. At present, Canada does not have a national enquiry process to review maternal deaths, severe morbidity, and near misses, and has not set targets for maternal mortality reduction. Maternal mortality rates are critical measures of maternal health and provide important information for analysis of trends and priorities among and within countries. Information about near misses as well as maternal morbidity is crucial to truly understand and to prevent maternal mortality. Canadian experts must work together with governments, provinces, and territories to determine key indicators, measurement, and meaningful data analysis strategies. These data and their comparisons will form the foundation of evidence to guide programs, policies, priorities, and interventions that will ultimately improve the health of mothers and their children.

This would help organizations particularly businesses protect their information, the valuable assets, effectively and efficiently according to the best current practice. Currently, public agencies in Malaysia are managing their documents and records using digital document management system (DDMS) as an instance of EDRMS. However, organizations face difficulties in implementing the DDMS as the initiative was not guided by appropriate guideline or policy. Thus, resulting in high rate of users rejecting the implementation of DDMS. Furthermore, factors influencing the implementation of DDMS has not been known. Therefore, this paper seeks to identify the factors influencing the implementation of EDRMS and investigate the appropriateness of the identified factors to establish the implementation policy for the Malaysia public sector.

Petrochemical leakage causes potential losses to the economy, life and environmental. Early detection can minimize the impact. A common technique to detect leakage of fuel tanks in gasoline stations is using systematic record and statistical analysis of the liquid level. However, the routine check using dipstick by station operator and manual analysis of inventory using inventory sheet and calculator are lacking efficiency. Computerized automation can result in continuous analysis and early detection. This study develops and evaluates a computerized system to that performs Statistical Inventory Reconciliation ( SIR) on inventory data and presents the calculation of leak possibility, probability and rate. The result shows promising reliability and effectiveness. This study integrates workflow, algorithm, data structure and output visualization in a single framework to minimize human factor and to improve the process. The proposed system framework is non-intrusive to existing operation and can be used as a reference for development of expert systems in liquid inventory management and leak detection.;"[Musthafa, Nurul Hafizha Binti; Hooi, Yew Kwang; Hassan, M.

This intelligent-type of control is strongly based on the concepts of fuzzy sets, linguistic variables and approximate reasoning. On the other hand, programmable logic controllers, or PLCs, are types of digital controller used mainly in industrial processes and machine automations. These controllers are more reliable, flexible and robust compared with conventional relay-based control systems. The introduction of fuzzy logic to PLC will greatly improve the capability of the system to produce intelligent and 'reasoned' decisions. With that, this study presents the design and implementation of fuzzy logic-based expert system in a PLC hardware. Proportional-derivative (PD) control is the type of control system used for fuzzy logic. The fuzzifier includes two inputs: error and rate of error. The testing and evaluation of the fuzzy algorithm were conducted before actual runs through offline simulation, thus, saving valuable time in fault detection, debugging and troubleshooting.;"[Baldovino, Renann G.; Dadios, Elmer P.] De La Salle Univ, Gokongwei Coll Engn, Mfg Engn & Management Dept, Manila 0922, Philippines";Baldovino, RG (corresponding author), De La Salle Univ, Gokongwei Coll Engn, Mfg Engn & Management Dept, Manila 0922, Philippines.;;;Baldovino, Renann/0000-0002-8709-5692;Department of Science and Technology (DOST)Department of Science & Technology (India);The authors would like to thank the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) for the research support.;;23;0;0;0;5;AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS;VALENCIA;26650 THE OLD RD, STE 208, VALENCIA, CA 91381-0751 USA;1936-6612;1936-7317;;ADV SCI LETT;Adv.

Food additives should be safe if the acceptable daily intake is complied with: however, some individuals can experience immediate effects such as headache or impaired mental concentration, behavior, and immune response. Long-term effects may increase cancer or cardiovascular disease risk in some individuals (1). The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of potentially harmful excipients in the top-selling dietary supplements in the Czech Republic and to consider their adverse effects. From the list of the best-selling dietary supplements (DS) in the Czech Republic in 2014, their active ingredients and excipients were identified using the database of the information system Decisions of the Chief Public Health Officer (IS RoHy). The IS RoHy collects data on any DS registered in the Czech Republic. Adverse effects of the excipients were retrieved from the PubMcd and Medline databases and from the websites of the European Safety Authorities. Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, and Codex Alimentarius. In total, 418 DS were identified, including 54.5% DS for children under 12 years of age. Of these. 66.7% contained at least one additive known to have a negative health effect. On average, there were five additives per DS. The most frequently reported additives were glycerol (28.7%). titanium dioxide (26.3%), sorbitol (12.9%). lecithin (10.5%) and beeswax (6.0%). The most commonly found potential adverse effects caused by additives as reported in the literature were gastrointestinal symptoms (51.0%). hypersensitivity reactions (31.3%), or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (6.5%). An EU list of approved and therefore safe additives has been established (2). Nevertheless, half of the most commonly used DS contained additives known to have adverse health effects. Such effects may potentially occur in predisposed patients and vulnerable groups of the population such as children or chronically ill patients, especially in the case of intake of multiple products containing the same additive. Further studies are needed to assess the clinical impact of adverse effects in DS users.;"[Straznicka, Julie; Pokladnikova, Jitka] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Pharm, Dept Social & Clin Pharm, Heyrovskeho 1203, Hradec Kralove 50005, Czech Republic; [Jahodar, Ludek] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Pharmaceut Bot & Ecol, Fac Pharm, Heyrovskeho 1203, Hradec Kralove 50005, Czech Republic";Straznicka, J (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Pharm, Dept Social & Clin Pharm, Heyrovskeho 1203, Hradec Kralove 50005, Czech Republic.;straj7aa@faf.cuni.cz;;;Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University in Prague [SVV 260 295];The study was supported by SVV 260 295, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University in Prague.;;35;0;0;1;9;POLSKIE TOWARZYSTWO FARMACEUTYCZNE;WARSAW;DLUGA 16, 00-238 WARSAW, POLAND;0001-6837;2353-5288;;ACTA POL PHARM;ACTA POL.

J;King, MW;;;;King, Michael W.;;;Health Care Efficiencies: Consolidation and Alternative Models vs. Health Care and Antitrust Regulation - Irreconcilable Differences?;AMERICAN JOURNAL OF LAW & MEDICINE;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"OECD COUNTRIES; UNITED-STATES; OUTCOMES; US; COMPETITION; INSURANCE; TRENDS";Despite the U.S. substantially outspending peer high income nations with almost 18% of GDP dedicated to health care, on any number of statistical measurements from life expectancy to birth rates to chronic disease,(1) the U.S. achieves inferior health outcomes. In short, Americans receive a very disappointing return on investment on their health care dollars, causing economic and social strain.(2) Accordingly, the debates rage on: what is the top driver of health care spending? Among the culprits: poor communication and coordination among disparate providers, paperwork required by payors and regulations, well-intentioned physicians overprescribing treatments, drugs and devices, outright fraud and abuse, and medical malpractice litigation. Fundamentally, what is the best way to reduce U.S. health care spending, while improving the patient experience of care in terms of quality and satisfaction, and driving better patient health outcomes? Mergers, partnerships, and consolidation in the health care industry, new care delivery models like Accountable Care Organizations and integrated care systems, bundled payments, information technology, innovation through new drugs and new medical devices, or some combination of the foregoing? More importantly, recent ambitious reform efforts fall short of a cohesive approach, leaving fundamental internal inconsistencies across divergent arms of the federal government, raising the issue of whether the U.S. health care system can drive sufficient efficiencies within the current health care and antitrust regulatory environments. While debate rages on Capitol Hill over repeal and replace, only limited attention has been directed toward reforming the current fee-for-service model pursuant to which providers are paid for volume of care rather than quality or outcomes. Indeed, both the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)(3) and proposals for its replacement focus primarily on the reach and cost of providing coverage for health care, rather than specifics for the delivery of health care.(4) With the U.S. expenditures on health care producing inferior results, experts see consolidation and alternatives to fee-for-service as fundamental to reducing costs.(5) Integrating care coordination and delivery and increasing scale to drive efficiencies allows organizations to benefit from shared savings and relationships with payors and vendors.(6) Deloitte forecasts that, by 2024, the current health system landscapewhich includes roughly 80 national health systems, 275 regional systems, 130 academic medical centers, and 1,300 small community systemswill morph into just over 900 multi-hospital systems.(7) Even though health care market and payment reforms encourage organizations to consolidate and integrate, innovators must proceed with extreme caution. Health care organizations attempting to drive efficiencies and bring down costs through mergers may run afoul of numerous federal and state laws and regulations.(8) Calls for updates or leniency in these laws are growing, including the possible recognition of an Obamacare defense to antitrust restrictions(9) and speculation that laws restricting physicians from having financial relationships will be repealed, ostensibly to allow sharing of the rewards reaped from coordinated care.(10) In the meantime, however, absent specific waivers or exemptions, all the usual rules and regulations apply, including antitrust constraints,(11) physician self-referral(12) and anti-kickback laws and regulations,(13) state fraud and abuse restrictions,(14) and more. In short, a maelstrom of conflicting political prescriptions, health care regulations, and antitrust restrictions undermine the ability of innovators to achieve efficiencies through joint ventures, transactions, innovative models, and other structures. This article first considers the conflicting positions taken by the United States government with respect to achieving efficiencies in health care under the ACA and alternative delivery models, on the one hand, and health care regulatory enforcement and antitrust enforcement, on the other. At almost a fifth of the U.S. economy,(15) health care arguably has grown ungovernable, exceeding the ability of any one law or branch of government to create or implement coherent reform. Indeed, the article posits that although the ACA reformed and expanded access to health care, it failed to transform the way health care is delivered beyond limited demonstration projects, leaving fee-for-service intact. Nonetheless, even with limited rather than revolutionary goals, the ACA still lacks sufficient authority across disparate branches of government to achieve its stated goals. The article then examines the conflicting positions of the various United States regulatory schemes and enforcement agencies governing health care, and whether they can be reconciled with the stated goal of the government, often referred to as the Triple Aim:(16) improving quality of care, improving population health, and lowering health care costs. It examines fundamental, systemic challenges to achieving the Triple Aim: longstanding health care regulatory laws that impede adoption of innovative delivery systems beyond their current demonstration project status, and antitrust enforcement that promotes waste and duplication in densely populated areas, while preventing necessary consolidation to more efficiently reach rural areas. The article concludes with recommendations for promoting efficiency through modest reconciliation of the conflicting goals and regulations in health care.;[King, Michael W.] Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, Denver, CO 80202 USA;King, MW (corresponding author), Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, Denver, CO 80202 USA.;;;;;;;105;2;2;3;18;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0098-8588;2375-835X;;AM J LAW MED;Am.

It indicates a need for popularizing scientific knowledge including information about scientific psychology and scientifically developed practical methods which must be conveyed to the public at large, to those who take great interest in psychology, but look for information in the mass media rather than at school or university. In the last decade the social networks have become an everyday source of information for many people, especially young, and the quality of information about psychology being spread through the networks is of considerable interest to psychologists. The study described aimed to assess academic quality of psychological texts in theme communities, popular with users of the social network Vkontakte. Expert assessment (by young academic psychologists working at research institutes and universities of Moscow and St. Petersburg) helped to identify communities broadcasting academically correct (scientifically proved) and incorrect (not proved scientifically) information about psychology in the network. Texts (news, posts) from the two types of communities were identified with the help of the crawler, a system of collecting data from social networks, and prevalent subjects and terminology were identified with the help of computerized linguistic analysis. The terms synapse, learning, axon, mediator could serve as indicators of the academic nature of the texts, while money, happiness, introvert are indicators of the opposite.

This study attempts to evaluate these systems in five areas of technical, functionality, usability, and vendors' capabilities, and care quality provided by HIS vendors. Materials and Methods: Through a cross-sectional study, the key HIS capabilities were evaluated in Iran. The key capabilities/requirements for HIS were specified by expert panel focus group meeting through the idea webbing and review of related literature. Modified Delphi technique was employed to collect and analyze data. The expert panels express their view on each of the HIS key capabilities on a 5-point scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree Checklist was designed based on expert panels' viewpoints and employed for evaluating HIS capabilities. Results: Technical requirements with 68.3% and vendors' capability requirements scored the highest marks (68%) while improved quality of patient care requirements scored the lowest mark (24.8'N). Functional requirement of the studied eight departments showed that financial department scored the highest (71.6%) while nutrition department scored the lowest marks (22.8%). Results on the evaluation of technical requirements showed that response time scored the highest (75%) while communication services scored the lowest marks (59.7%). Conclusion: The favorable status of Iran's HISs in technical area, their poor performance on the requirements of quality patient care place emphasis on financial and reimbursement objective, and neglect of Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms as a basis to support quality of patient care requirements endorse the fact that Iran's current HIS is still in its infancy. To narrow the variability and diversity in structure and requirements of HIS vendors, reducing the gap between required and adopted HIS functions, and moving toward meaningful use of HIS, well-organized actions at the level of Iran Ministry of Health appear essential.;"[Farzandipour, Mehrdad; Meidani, Zahra] Kashan Univ Med Sci, Hlth Informat Management Res Ctr, Kashan, Iran; [Gilasi, Hamidreza] Kashan Univ Med Sci, Sch Hlth, Epidemiol, Kashan, Iran; [Dehghan, Razlyeh] Hormozgan Univ Med Sci, Dept Management Informat Technol & Stat, Bandar Abbas, Iran";Meidani, Z (corresponding author), Kashan Univ Med Sci, Hlth Informat Management Res Ctr, Kashan, Iran.;meydaniza@kaums.ac.ir;Farzandipour, Mehrdad/G-8198-2017;Farzandipour, Mehrdad/0000-0001-9738-7771;Kashan University [91120];This work was supported by the Kashan University Vice Chancellor of Research and Technology [grant number 91120].;;63;2;2;0;8;WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS;MUMBAI;WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA;1755-6783;0974-6005;;ANN TROP MED PUBLIC;Ann.

Under the current state of technology, only the construction process proper is automated, while the work steps during the pre- and post-processes are performed manually or semi-automatically. As a result of the associated variations in working methods with major effects on the degree of inhalation exposure, the measured values show a broad spread. From these measurement findings, it therefore proves difficult to derive measures tailored to additive production applications.;"[Beisser, R.; von Mering, Y.; Pitzke, K.] Deutsch Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung IFA, Inst Arbeitsschutz, St Augustin, Germany; [Buxtrup, M.; Hohenberger, L.] Unfallkasse Nordrhein Westfalen UK NRW, Munster, Germany; [Fendler, D.] Berufsgenossenschaft Energie Text Elektro Mediene, Cologne, Germany; [Kazda, V.] Berufsgenossenschaft Energie Text Elektro Mediene, Wiesbaden, Germany; [Niemann, H.] Unfallkasse Nord, Hamburg, Germany; [Weiss, R.] Berufsgenossenschaft Holz & Metall BGHM, Mainz, Germany";Beisser, R (corresponding author), Deutsch Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung IFA, Inst Arbeitsschutz, St Augustin, Germany.;;;;;;;18;2;2;0;18;SPRINGER-V D I VERLAG GMBH & CO KG;DUSSELDORF;VDI-PLATZ 1, D-40468 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY;0949-8036;1436-4891;;GEFAHRST REINHALT L;Gefahrst.

The nature of unstructured sources impedes users' acquisition, analysis, and reuse of relevant information in an integral form, leading to a possible reduction in project performance because of untimely or inadequate decisions. This paper explores the representation of information from unstructured documents in the form of a key-phrase network, intended to provide users with the possibility to visualize and analyze valuable project facts with less effort. A network of key phrases automatically extracted from various types of unstructured documents, with relations based on contextual similarity, was implemented as a graph database, enabling project participants to extract and visualize various patterns in data. With the objective of constructing a domain-independent key-phrase network with minimal expert involvement, an approach to detect key phrases in a multilingual environment was examined by using measures of association between words while avoiding text content from less informative contexts. A possible application is demonstrated using key-phrase networks generated from two complex international construction projects.

It is applicable to solving interoperability problems and to compilation of models from point cloud data. The SeeBIM (Semantic Enrichment Engine for BIM) prototype software encapsulates domain expert knowledge in computer readable rules for inference of object types, identity and aggregation of systems. However, it is limited to axis-aligned bounding box geometry and the adequacy of its rule-sets cannot be guaranteed. This paper solves these drawbacks by (1) devising a new procedure for compiling inference rule sets that are known a priori to be adequate for complete and thorough classification of model objects, and (2) enhancing the operators to compute complex geometry and enable precise topological rule processing. The procedure for compiling adequate rule sets is illustrated using a synthetic concrete highway bridge model. A real-world highway bridge model, with 333 components of 13 different types and compiled from a laser scanned point cloud, is used to validate the approach and test the enhanced SeeBIM system. All of the elements are classified correctly, demonstrating the efficacy of the approach to semantic enrichment.;"[Sacks, Rafael; Kattel, Uri] Technion, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel; [Ma, Ling] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Art Design & Architecture, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Yosef, Raz] Technion, Natl Bldg Res Inst, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel; [Borrmann, Andre; Daum, Simon] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Computat Modeling & Simulat, D-80333 Munich, Germany";Ma, L (corresponding author), Univ Huddersfield, Sch Art Design & Architecture, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England.;"cvsacks@technion.ac.il; l.ma@hud.ac.uk; razyos@gmail.com; andre.borrmann@tum.de; simon.daum@tum.de; uri.kattel@gmail.com";"Ma, Ling/F-3413-2019; Ma, L/F-6641-2010; Sacks, Rafael/B-1431-2008";"Ma, Ling/0000-0002-9187-471X; Ma, L/0000-0002-9187-471X; Sacks, Rafael/0000-0001-9427-5053";"European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstrationEuropean Union (EU) [31109806.0007]; ERA-NET Plus Infravation; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre; Ministerie van Infrastructuur en Milieu; Rijkswaterstaat; Bundesministerium fur Verkehr; Bau und Stadtentwicklung; Danish Road Directorate; Statens Vegvesen Vegdirektoratet; Trafikverket-Trv; Vegageroin; Ministere de L'ecologie, du Developpement Durable et de L'energie; Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial; Anas S.P.A.; Netivei Israel-National Transport Infrastructure Company Ltd.; Federal Highway Administration USDOT";This project has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under Grant Agreement 31109806.0007.

It consists of three main steps: (1) metamodel construction; (2) metamodel validation; and (3) global US analysis. A multi-input and multioutput metamodel, with least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms incorporated, is built in order to simulate system behaviors of tunnel-induced building damage. Three indicators-mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), variance of absolute percentage error (VAPE), and mean square percentage error (MSPE)-are proposed to test the prediction performance of the metamodel. The extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST) is used to perform global US analysis on the basis of the well-trained metamodel. The novelty of the developed approach lies in its capability of learning from given data to identify relationships between model inputs and outputs to provide an access for conducting global US analysis. The collected data from the construction of the Wuhan Metro system (WMS) in China are used in a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach. Results indicate that the developed approach is capable of (1) predicting and assessing the magnitude of tunnel-induced building damage in terms of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of model outputs, and (2) identifying the most significant and insignificant factors for possible dimension reduction to improve the understanding of the model behavior. This research contributes to (1) the body of knowledge by proposing a more appropriate research methodology that can cope with aleatory and epistemic uncertainty and support global US analysis based on given data, and (2) the state of practice by providing a data-driven metamodel technique to simulate system behaviors of tunnel-induced building damage with high reliability and reduce dependency on domain experts.

The velocity of change requires attention to fuzzy decision-making, a model that attempts to take into account one end of the complexity of the world and its constraints, including that of temporal pressure in expert assessments. This point of view attempts to introduce both the advantages of fuzzy decision-making processes in these assessments and their limitations. Knowledge is undeniably progressing, but so are error, ignorance, and blindness. At the same time, it remains difficult to reduce the tension between those who produce risks (industrialists, for example) and those subjected to it (consumers) given that the latter do not have the same weapons to defend themselves as the producers. Without sufficient knowledge for risk assessment, fuzzy decision-making methods have advantages: they incorporate decision-making intelligence into the analysis of the system and allow articulation of long-term prospects and short-and medium term politics. Decisions are rarely made in this way, because advice is often requested in a crisis situation requiring rapid conclusions. Experts should, if given the time, rely on an intellectual construct, and the virtue of the fuzzy approach is to allow for concerted advancement and the better confidence necessary to continue on the path of progress.;"[Andre, Jean-Claude] CNRS, INSIS, 3 Rue Michel Ange, F-75016 Paris, France; [Gnansia, Elisabeth] Engie, Direct Sante Secur, 1 Pl Samuel Champlain, F-92930 Paris, France";Andre, JC (corresponding author), CNRS, INSIS, 3 Rue Michel Ange, F-75016 Paris, France.;"jean-claude.andre@cnrs-dir.fr; elisabeth.gnansia@engie.com";;;;;;28;3;3;0;2;JOHN LIBBEY EUROTEXT LTD;MONTROUGE;127 AVE DE LA REPUBLIQUE, 92120 MONTROUGE, FRANCE;1635-0421;1952-3998;;ENVIRON RISQUE SANTE;Environ.

This fate engraved in the genetic material, as mentioned in Watson's quote, fueled a tremendous revolution wave in gene therapy. Gene therapy is a promising technology for treating genetic and acquired diseases by modulating the expression of a specific gene in the pathological cells. This is achieved by introducing a DNA sequence or other nucleic acid material or oligonucleotides to the target cell (Kay, 2011). Moreover, gene therapy contributes to correction of genetic defects, expression of therapeutic proteins, and inhibition of the synthesis of malignant proteins. In this review article, different non-viral gene delivery systems and their applications are discussed in detail. We reviewed and tabulated over 90 papers and 50 patents from 2006 to date discussing non-viral gene delivery technologies, innovation, and bench-to-bedside transformation. Furthermore, we are going to shed light on the lack of standardization in the design and characterization of non-viral gene delivery systems worldwide, which is a major concern in this research's field. This review would aid in getting an eagle eye view through non-viral gene delivery technologies during the past 20 years. Such a view, capturing the advances, the hurdles, and experimental details, would aid expert researchers in tuning their experimentation strategies and help newcomers better initially design their studies to generate solid and comprehensive results that can be reliable and reproducible.;"[Helal, N.

Sriram; Singh, Hardeep";;;Using Fault Trees to Advance Understanding of Diagnostic Errors;JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"PATIENT SAFETY; PRIMARY-CARE; MEDICINE; SYSTEM; FREQUENCY; AVIATION";Problem Definition: Diagnostic errors annually affect at least 5% of adults in the outpatient setting in the United States. Formal analytic techniques are only infrequently used to understand them, in part because of the complexity of diagnostic processes and clinical work flows involved. In this article, diagnostic errors were modeled using fault tree analysis (FTA), a form of root cause analysis that has been successfully used in other high-complexity, high-risk contexts. How factors contributing to diagnostic errors can be systematically modeled by FTA to inform error understanding and error prevention is demonstrated. Initial Approach: A team of three experts reviewed 10 published cases of diagnostic error and constructed fault trees. The fault trees were modeled according to currently available conceptual frameworks characterizing diagnostic error. The 10 trees were then synthesized into a single fault tree to identify common contributing factors and pathways leading to diagnostic error. Key Insights: FTA is a visual, structured, deductive approach that depicts the temporal sequence of events and their interactions in a formal logical hierarchy. The visual FTA enables easier understanding of causative processes and cognitive and system factors, as well as rapid identification of common pathways and interactions in a unified fashion. In addition, it enables calculation of empirical estimates for causative pathways. Thus, fault trees might provide a useful framework for both quantitative and qualitative analysis of diagnostic errors. Next Steps: Future directions include establishing validity and reliability by modeling a wider range of error cases, conducting quantitative evaluations, and undertaking deeper exploration of other FTA capabilities.;"[Rogith, Deevakar] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Biomed Informat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Iyengar, M.

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (or polyradiculoneuropathy, CIDP) is an uncommon entity of very heterogeneous clinical behavior, but susceptible to treatment. Several proposals on electrophysiological diagnostic criteria exist as well as numerous studies on the response to immunomodulatory treatments. The general consensus about its diagnosis and management, however, has not been reached in Mexico through its major health institutions. Objective. To develop a guideline on definition, diagnosis and treatment of the CIDP by using the best existing scientific evidence and when not available, the consensus of experts. Methods. A group of neurologists of Mexican institutions pertaining to the Study Group of Neuromuscular Diseases of the Mexican Academy of Neurology carried out a MEDLINE and Cochrane systematic reviews search, selecting the best available evidence and qualifying the recommendations according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. The recommendations are organized into short statements that are supported by a brief dissertation on the scientific evidence of which the statements derived. Recommendations. This panel recommends testing and diagnostic criteria proposed by the EFNS/PNS (European Federation of Neurological Societies / Peripheral Nerve Society) that are described in the present document. For treatment aspects, this panel recommends intravenous immunoglobulin or steroids as first line treatment for the classical sensorimotor forms of CIDP, immunoglobulin exclusively for pure motor forms and plasma exchange in case of treatment failure or incomplete response to immunoglobulin or steroids. In case of inappropriate response or required high doses or long periods of first-line drugs, immunomodulatory adjuvant therapy should be considered alone or in combination.;"[Steven Vargas-Canas, Edwin; Leon-Manriquez, Elizabeth; Edith Salmeron-Mercado, Monica; Gilberto Zuniga-Garcia, David] Natl Inst Neurol & Neurosurg Manuel Velasco Suare, Neuromuscular Dis Clin, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Chiquete, Erwin; Madrigal-Salas, Gabriela] Natl Inst Med Sci & Nutr Salvador Zubiran, Neuromuscular Dis Clin, Dept Neurol & Psychiat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ruano-Calderon, Luis A.] Durango Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Durango, Mexico; [Isaias Plascencia-Alvarez, Noel] ISSSTE Natl Med Ctr 20 Noviembre, Dept Neurol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Juarez-Jimenez, Humberto] Gen Hosp Doctor Gaudencio Gonzalez Garza, IMSS Natl Med Ctr La Raza, Dept Neurol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Carrera-Pineda, Raul] IMSS Natl Med Ctr Siglo XXI, Dept Neurol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico";Vargas-Canas, ES (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Neurol & Neurocirugia Manuel Velasco Su, Clin Enfermedades Neuromusculares, Insurgentes 3877, Mexico City 14269, DF, Mexico.;stevenvc@hotmail.com;Chiquete, Erwin/ABF-9482-2020;;"Innovare S.A. de C.V.; LFB France";This work received logistic support partially funded by Innovare S.A. de C.V. and LFB France.

The present study combined multifunctional ecological footprint with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to estimate environmental impacts of inefficient use of resources of silage corn production in the Sarayan County, Iran. In this applied survey research, data were collected using a questionnaire accompanied by face-to-face interviews with 42 farmers (N=48). Validity of the instrument was approved by a panel of experts; while its reliability was secured via pretest-posttest method. Results showed that mean technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency were 0.86, 0.93, and 0.80; respectively. The CO2 footprints were 0.95 and 0.83 gha under current and optimum conditions; respectively, with electricity and manure comprising the highest and lowest shares. The Ecological footprint land- (gha gha(-1) farm), yield- (gha ton(-1)) and revenue-based (gha $(-1) 1,000) EFs were estimated to be 1.6, 0.84, and 1.4 under current conditions but 1.57, 0.081, and 1.33 under optimum conditions, respectively. When the resources were used efficiently, the EFCO2 and EF improved by 13.42 and 3.35% respectively, in which the highest shares in terms of quantity and percentage belonged to electricity, manure and fertilizer. Findings implied that optimum usage of electricity and fertilizer could play a significant role in mitigating environmental impacts of silage corn production in Sarayan. Local agricultural extension should focus on introduction of innovative irrigation systems to reduce water, electricity and fertilizer consumption. Meanwhile, to improve silage corn efficiency, farm size expansion is recommended based on the DEA findings.";"[Esfahani, S. M. J.; Mahdei, K.

In this paper, we outline the protocol for developing a hospital-based surveillance system modelled on the Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) system in Australia. Using PAEDS-Vietnam we will define the aetiology, motor function and its severity, associated impairments, and nutritional and rehabilitation status of children with CP in Hanoi, Vietnam. These essential baseline data will inform future health service planning, health professional education and training, and family support. Methods and analysis This is a hospital-based prospective surveillance of children with CP presenting to the rehabilitation, neurology and general paediatric services at the National Children's Hospital and St Paul Hospital in Hanoi. We will use active, prospective daily case-finding for all children with CP aged <18 years who are hospitalised or present to outpatient departments. Following parental consent, data will be collected using a modified version of the Australian Cerebral Palsy Register questionnaire. The data collection form has been developed in consultation with local and international experts and translated into Vietnamese. Information collected will include demographics, maternal health and birth history, type and severity of CP, known risk factors for CP, and nutrition, immunisation, education and rehabilitation status. Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the Hanoi Medical University Institutional Review Board (decision no 1722) and The University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (approval no 2016/456). Establishment of PAEDS-Vietnam will enable hospital-based surveillance of CP for the first time in Vietnam. It will identify preventable causes of CP, patient needs and service gaps, and facilitate early diagnosis and intervention. Study findings will be disseminated through local and international conferences and peer-reviewed publications.;"[Khandaker, Gulam; Elliott, Elizabeth J.] Univ Sydney, Discipline Child & Adolescent Hlth, Childrens Hosp Westmead, Clin Sch,Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Khandaker, Gulam] Univ South Asia, AIDD, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Nguyen Van Bang] Hanoi Med Univ, Dept Paediat, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Trinh Quang Dung; Nguyen Thi Huong Giang] Natl Childrens Hosp, Rehabil Dept, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Cao Minh Chau] Natl Childrens Hosp, Rehabil Dept, Bach Mai Hosp, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Nguyen Thi Van Anh] Hanoi Med Univ, Med Educ & Skills Lab, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Nguyen Van Thuong] St Paul Hanoi Municipal Hosp, Paediat Dept, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Badawi, Nadia] Univ Sydney, Grace Ctr Newborn Care, Childrens Hosp Westmead, Sydney Med Sch, Westmead, NSW, Australia; [Badawi, Nadia] Univ Sydney, Cerebral Palsy Alliance Res Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Elliott, Elizabeth J.] Kids Res Inst, Australian Paediat Surveillance Unit, Westmead, NSW, Australia";"Khandaker, G (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Discipline Child & Adolescent Hlth, Childrens Hosp Westmead, Clin Sch,Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Khandaker, G (corresponding author), Univ South Asia, AIDD, Dhaka, Bangladesh.";gulam.khandaker@health.nsw.gov.au;"; Khandaker, Gulam/G-6171-2019";"Elliott, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6501-5487; Khandaker, Gulam/0000-0002-0661-4113";"Research Foundation of Cerebral Palsy Alliance [PG 6115]; NHMRC Health Early Career FellowshipNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [1054414]; NHMRC Practitioner FellowshipNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [457084(MD1)]";This study is funded by the Research Foundation of Cerebral Palsy Alliance (PG 6115).

Nonetheless, other tasks requiring visual expertise are unlikely to be entrusted to machines for some time, e.g., satellite and medical imagery analysis. We describe a human-machine cooperative approach to visual search, the aim of which is to outperform either human or machine acting alone. The traditional route to augmenting human performance with automatic classifiers is to draw boxes around regions of an image deemed likely to contain a target. Human experts typically reject this type of hard highlighting. We propose instead a soft highlighting technique in which the saliency of regions of the visual field is modulated in a graded fashion based on classifier confidence level. We report on experiments with both synthetic and natural images showing that soft highlighting achieves a performance synergy surpassing that attained by hard highlighting.;"[Kneusel, Ronald T.; Mozer, Michael C.] Univ Colorado, Dept Comp Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA";Kneusel, RT (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Comp Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;"ron@kneusel.org; mozer@colorado.edu";;;NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [SES-1461535, DRL-1631428, SBE-0542013, SMA-1041755];This research was supported by NSF grants SES-1461535, DRL-1631428, SBE-0542013, and SMA-1041755.;;38;5;5;1;2;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;1544-3558;1544-3965;;ACM T APPL PERCEPT;ACM Trans.

The hierarchy model structure of the Pranburi watershed was developed by the experts based on IWRM and classified into 4 criteria, 15 sub-criteria, and 3 alternatives. The questionnaire method was the tool used for obtaining a weighing for comparison between the pairs of criteria obtained from community representatives. The finding revealed that the important criteria are the environmental factors. The highest ranked of the alternatives is the watershed planning strategy. These results implied that community focused stakeholder participation in the decision-making process for water resources in Pranburi watershed gave a positive outcome. This research clearly presented the capability of the AHP approach integrates with IWRM principle for water resource planning. The AHP approach can analyze the community representative's relevant data before decision making, by applying pairwise comparison of the AHP technique, can reduce bias during decision making.

Data were collected over a 14-year period from 132 information technology (IT) practitioners from an industrialized region in Mexico and analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). While implementation success factors for MSS/DMSS and MIS have been studied previously, few comparative studies have been reported. Differences in implementation success factors between MSS/DMSS and MIS were found. Three clearly identified implementation success factors were found for MIS (i.e., project management, organizational feasibility and IT resources), and two factors emerged for MSS/DMSS with mixed items (i.e., system-organization-technical feasibility, and alignment between users, team, system and organization). The results indicate that achieving MSS/DMSS implementation success is more complex than for MIS. Although exploratory in nature, the comparative differences offer guidance to IT practitioners in implementing such systems and contribute to the MSS/DMSS literature with insights on implementation success factors that are unique to this type of IT system.;"[Mora, Manuel] Autonomous Univ Aguascalientes, Informat Syst, Aguascalientes 20100, Ags, Mexico; [Phillips-Wren, Gloria] Loyola Univ Maryland, Informat Syst Operat Management, 4501 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA; [Wang, Fen] Cent Washington Univ, Informat Technol & Adm Management, Ellensburg, WA 98926 USA; [Gelman, Ovsei] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, CCADET, Circuito Exterior S-N, Ciudad De Mexico 04510, DF, Mexico";Mora, M (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Aguascalientes, Informat Syst, Aguascalientes 20100, Ags, Mexico.;"mmora@correo.uaa.mx; gwren@loyola.edu; wangfen@cwu.edu; ogelman@unam.mx";;;;;;103;1;1;0;5;WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD;SINGAPORE;5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE;0219-6220;1793-6845;;INT J INF TECH DECIS;Int.

Addressing engineering systems problems challenges the limits of analytic methods; this paper focuses on optimization as the method. Traditional normative optimization addresses objective trade-off issues by quantifying the relationships among decision-maker choices and system performance. Engineering systems can present options and trade-offs that are outside traditional analysis boundaries and often require different domain expertise. The usual response is to expand the frame of analysis, relying on expert heuristic rules of thumb to make the task manageable. However, these heuristics can create irrelevant constraints, lead to cognitive biases, or result in unnecessarily suboptimal solutions. This paper presents an initial framework to encourage explicit examination of decisions made when framing and formulating an engineering systems-relevant optimization problem. This includes consciously determining when to keep heuristics for efficiency and when to replace them with a more normative approach. The paper provides two examples that use optimization in two different roles. The first uses an optimization problem in a simulation tool that predicts future CO2 emissions from commercial aviation for scenarios with different technology and economic inputs. The second example is based on an actively controlled wind turbine and demonstrates how a reasonable-seeming heuristic for defining the objective can lead to a result that is suboptimal in terms of the true system performance objective. These examples demonstrate the explicit examination of the framing and formulation to achieve a good combination of normative and heuristic approaches.";"[Crossley, William A.] Purdue Univ, Sch Aeronaut & Astronaut, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Luan, Siyao; Allison, James T.; Thurston, Deborah L.] Univ Illinois, Ind & Enterprise Syst Engn, Urbana, IL USA";Crossley, WA (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Sch Aeronaut & Astronaut, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;crossley@purdue.edu;;;"Federal Aviation Adminstration, ASCENT Project [10 13-C-AJFE-PU]; Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing InnovationNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [CMMI-1538234]; Directorate For EngineeringNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [1538234] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact InnNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [1538234] Funding Source: National Science Foundation";"Federal Aviation Adminstration, Grant/Award Number: ASCENT Project 10 13-C-AJFE-PU; Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation, Grant/Award Number: CMMI-1538234";;50;0;0;0;5;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1098-1241;1520-6858;;SYSTEMS ENG;Syst.

During this rescue operation, precise and dynamic trajectory tracking of DSRV is difficult due to poor visibility and complex marine environment caused by unstable waves, winds etc. In this work a Genetic based Fuzzy Logic Controller (GAFLC) is designed to solve the trajectory tracking control problem of DSRV in the presence of unknown time varying wave disturbances. In first step a conventional Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is designed with fixed rule base and membership functions from expert's knowledge and scaling factor chosen by trial and error. In second step to enhance the trajectory tracking performance and to improve the system robustness to unstable wave disturbances the complete knowledge base of FLC is parameterized and optimized to find an optimal fuzzy controller without expert's knowledge. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the input and output membership fiinctions, the rule base and the scaling factors of FLC simultaneously. Simulations are performed on four 2D reference trajectories corresponding to under water scenarios to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed GAFLC in trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection.;[Auxillia, D.

We applied the AAPM Task Group 100 recommended failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) tool to develop a risk-based quality management program for Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Methods: A team consisting of medical physicists, radiation oncologists, neurosurgeons, radiation safety officers, nurses, operating room technologists, and schedulers at our institution and an external physicist expert on Gamma Knife was formed for the FMEA study. A process tree and a failure mode table were created for the Gamma Knife radiosurgery procedures using the Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion and 4C units. Three scores for the probability of occurrence (O), the severity (S), and the probability of no detection for failure mode (D) were assigned to each failure mode by 8 professionals on a scale from 1 to 10. An overall risk priority number (RPN) for each failure mode was then calculated from the averaged O, S, and D scores. The coefficient of variation for each O, S, or D score was also calculated. The failure modes identified were prioritized in terms of both the RPN scores and the severity scores. Results: The established process tree for Gamma Knife radiosurgery consists of 10 subprocesses and 53 steps, including a subprocess for frame placement and 11 steps that are directly related to the frame-based nature of the Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Out of the 86 failure modes identified, 40 Gamma Knife specific failure modes were caused by the potential for inappropriate use of the radiosurgery head frame, the imaging fiducial boxes, the Gamma Knife helmets and plugs, the skull definition tools as well as other features of the GammaPlan treatment planning system. The other 46 failure modes are associated with the registration, imaging, image transfer, contouring processes that are common for all external beam radiation therapy techniques. The failure modes with the highest hazard scores are related to imperfect frame adaptor attachment, bad fiducial box assembly, unsecured plugs/inserts, overlooked target areas, and undetected machine mechanical failure during the morning QA process. Conclusions: The implementation of the FMEA approach for Gamma Knife radiosurgery enabled deeper understanding of the overall process among all professionals involved in the care of the patient and helped identify potential weaknesses in the overall process. The results of the present study give us a basis for the development of a risk based quality management program for Gamma Knife radiosurgery.;"[Xu, Andy Yuanguang; Bhatnagar, Jagdish; Bednarz, Greg; Flickinger, John; Arai, Yoshio; Huq, M.

Different from traditional multiple-trait models, SEMs allow assessment of potential causal interrelationships between outcomes and can effectively discriminate between direct and indirect effects. For illustration, we focused on feedlot performance and its relationship to health outcomes related to Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD), which accounts for approximately 75% of morbidity and 50-80% of deaths in feedlots. Our data consisted of 1430 lots representing 178,983 cattle from 9 feedlot operations located across the US Great Plains. We explored functional links between arrival weight (AW; i = 1), BRD-related treatment costs (Trt$; as a proxy for health; i = 2) and average daily weight gain (ADG; as an indicator of productive performance i = 3), accounting for the fixed effect of sex and correlation patterns due to the clustering of lots within feedlots. We proposed competing plausible causal models based on expert knowledge. The best fitting model selected for inference supported direct effects of AW on ADG as well as indirect effects of AW on ADG mediated by Trt$. Direct effects from outcome i' to outcome i are quantified by the structural coefficient lambda(ii), such that every unit increase in kg/head of AW had a direct effect of increasing ADG by approximately (estimate +/- standard error) (lambda) over cap (31) = 0.002 +/- 0.0001 kg/head/day and also a direct effect of reducing Trt$ by an estimated (lambda) over cap (21) = $0.08 +/- 0.006 USD per head. In addition, every $1 USD spent on Trt$ directly decreased ADG by an estimated (lambda) over cap (32) = 0.004 +/- 0.0006 kg/head/day. From these estimates, we show how to compute the indirect, Trt$-mediated, effect of AW on ADG, as well as the overall effect of AW on ADG, including both direct and indirect effects. We further compared estimates of SEM-based effects with those obtained from standard linear regression mixed models and demonstrated the additional advantage of explicitly distinguishing direct and indirect components of an overall regression effect using SEMs. Understanding the direct and indirect mechanisms of interplay between health and performance outcomes may provide valuable insight into production systems.";"[Cha, Elva; Sanderson, Mike; Renter, David; Cernicchiaro, Natalia] Kansas State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Diagnost Med Pathobiol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Cha, Elva; Sanderson, Mike; Renter, David; Cernicchiaro, Natalia; Bello, Nora M.] Kansas State Univ, Coll Vet Med, CORE, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Jager, Abigail; Bello, Nora M.] Kansas State Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Stat, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA";Bello, NM (corresponding author), 002 Dickens Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.;nbello@ksu.edu;;;United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2015-67015-23079];We would like to thank Luciana Hernandez for her assistance with preparing the data for this study and Kristin MacDonald from STATA for answering technical questions on the STATA SEM package.

The glass insulator often self-shatters but the available identification methods are inefficient and unreliable. Then, an automatic identification and localization technology of self-shattered glass insulators is proposed, which consists of the cameras installed on the tower video monitoring devices or the unmanned aerial vehicles, the 4G/OPGW network, and the monitoring center, where the identification and localization algorithm is embedded into the expert software. First, the images of insulators are captured by cameras, which are processed to identify the region of insulator string by the presented identification algorithm of insulator string. Second, according to the characteristics of the insulator string image, a mathematical model of the insulator string is established to estimate the direction and the length of the sliding blocks. Third, local binary pattern histograms of the template and the sliding block are extracted, by which the self-shattered insulator can be recognized and located. Finally, a series of experiments is fulfilled to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. For single insulator images, Ac, Pr, and Rc of the algorithm are 94.5%, 92.38%, and 96.78%, respectively. For double insulator images, Ac, Pr, and Rc are 90.00%, 86.36%, and 93.23%, respectively. (C) The Authors.

J;Grude, F;;;;Grude, F.;;;New Regulations on Registration and Removal of Indications of High-Cost Medications from the Liste en Sus in Healthcare Institutions;ONCOLOGIE;;;French;Article;;;;;;"Clinical practice; Financial risk; Access to innovations; Cost of drugs; Benefit risk ratio; Medico economic";"PHASE-III; CANCER; SAFETY";The Liste en sus system, which has been operational since 2004, offers innovations to all patients on the territory and guarantees accessibility to treatments. This derogatory financing is dynamic and favors proven innovations. The decree of March 24th adopts the recommendations of the the Hospitalization Council and inscribes objective criteria for registration. The decree concerns the management of AAM indications (marketing authorization). Thus, some indications that no longer respect all the required criteria are deleted from the Liste en sus. Since 2014, and after obtaining a European marketing authorization, each indication is submitted to the French Health Authority transparency committee, which attributes the criteria medical benefit (service medical rendu) and improvement of medical benefit (amelioration du service medical rendu) for community accreditation and addition to the Liste en sus. Therefore the price is negotiated between the Economic Committee of Medicinal Products and the pharmaceutical laboratory. The Observatory of Cancer (OMEDIT Bretagne and OMEDIT Pays de la Loire), OMEDIT Normandie and OMEDIT Rhone-Alpes offer the medical community a tool that is regularly updated to monitor the progress of each indication in this complex system and to know the final care at the time of prescription. Moreover, the information systems are not yet adapted to these changes and the financial risk for the hospitals is real. Two situations therefore need to be monitored: indications deleted from the Liste en sus that no longer benefit from this takeover and indications awaiting registration. These situations may lead to differences in access to treatments, particularly in situations of rare cancer with low therapeutic arsenal or indications waiting for inclusion on the Liste en sus, which have shown a high benefit and are identified as such by the French Health Authority. Therefore, the recommendations of the Transparency Commission and the experts' advice on the field provide compelling additional information on the risk/benefit ratio of each new indication in clinical practice and often on a population quite different from that of trials (age, comorbidities, safety, previous therapeutic guidelines, and so on).;"[Grude, F.] OMEDIT Bretagne, Observ Canc, 15 Rue Andre Boquel,CS 1059, F-49055 Angers 02, France; [Grude, F.] OMEDIT Pays de la Loire, Pilotage Grp Canc RESOMEDIT, Siege Coordinat Med, ICO Paul Papin, 15 Rue Andre Boquel,CS 1059, F-49055 Angers 02, France";"Grude, F (corresponding author), OMEDIT Bretagne, Observ Canc, 15 Rue Andre Boquel,CS 1059, F-49055 Angers 02, France.; Grude, F (corresponding author), OMEDIT Pays de la Loire, Pilotage Grp Canc RESOMEDIT, Siege Coordinat Med, ICO Paul Papin, 15 Rue Andre Boquel,CS 1059, F-49055 Angers 02, France.";Francoise.Grude@ico.unicancer.fr;;;;;;8;1;1;0;4;SPRINGER FRANCE;PARIS;22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE;1292-3818;1765-2839;;ONCOLOGIE;Oncologie;NOV;2017;19;11-12;;;;;353;362;;10.1007/s10269-017-2735-8;;;10;Oncology;Oncology;FS4CR;WOS:000419735600004;;;;;2021-02-18;

Of the 33 recognized adult FGIDs, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most prevalent, with a worldwide prevalence estimated at 12%. IBS is an important health care concern as it greatly affects patients' quality of life and imposes a significant economic burden to the health care system. Cardinal symptoms of IBS include abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. The absence of abdominal pain makes the diagnosis of IBS untenable. The diagnosis of IBS can be made by performing a careful review of the patient's symptoms, taking a thoughtful history (e.g., diet, medication, medical, surgical, and psychological history), evaluating the patient for the presence of warning signs (e.g., red flags of anemia, hematochezia, unintentional weight loss, or a family history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease), performing a guided physical examination, and using the Rome IV criteria. The Rome criteria were developed by a panel of international experts in the field of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Although initially developed to guide researchers, these criteria have undergone several revisions with the intent of making them clinically useful and relevant. This monograph provides a brief overview on the development of the Rome criteria, discusses the utility of the Rome IV criteria, and reviews how the criteria can be applied clinically to diagnose IBS. In addition, a diagnostic strategy for the cost-effective diagnosis of IBS will be reviewed.;"[Lacy, Brian E.; Patel, Nihal K.] Dartmouth Hitchcock Med Ctr, One Med Ctr Dr, Lebanon, NH 03756 USA";Patel, NK (corresponding author), Dartmouth Hitchcock Med Ctr, One Med Ctr Dr, Lebanon, NH 03756 USA.;"brian.e.lacy@hitchcock.org; nihal.k.patel@hitchcock.org";;;;;;20;79;81;1;12;MDPI AG;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2077-0383;;;J CLIN MED;J.

Using cause and effect feedback loops, a qualitative model is constructed. The relationships between different parameters are then determined by expert's judgment and real data obtained from several real projects, and the quantitative model is built. The labor productivity is simulated by the proposed SD model, considering all affecting factors. For higher accuracy, the model is examined on two types of contractors and two models are constructed. The total productivity of each contractor is obtained, and the effect of different parameters on the labor productivity is investigated. (C) 2017 Sharif University of Technology.

Decision support systems for health workforce planning can play an important role in achieving an effective and equitable allocation of workers. However, existing methodologies in resource-constrained health systems rely on expert panels to determine the relationship between facility performance and staff levels rather than empirical evidence, require large amount of facility-specific data collection, and frequently fail to account for geographic, social, and economic differences between health facilities. We propose a framework for health worker allocation that overcomes some of these limitations. By integrating multiple sources of publicly available data with key facility-specific measures, statistical modeling can be used to estimate the relationship between staff allocations and facility performance. The resulting model can then be used in an optimization framework to explore how changes in policy scenarios and demographics can affect optimal staffing allocation. We explore this framework in a case study of South African health facilities, demonstrating the effectiveness of even this limited application of our framework, despite the challenges posed, and discuss the implications for future policy decisions and data collection.;"[Goudey, B.; Hickson, R.

To promote progress toward a cure for multiple sclerosis, the Accelerated Cure Project has created an open repository of biological and survey data on patients with multiple sclerosis. Similar large-scale repositories are being created in other domains. As the open, data-driven model of science proliferates, the research community faces a growing need for a cloud platform for collaborative data science. Such a platform should facilitate collaboration between domain experts and data scientists and possess artificial intelligence capabilities for organizing, recommending, and manipulating data analyses. In this paper, we present some foundational technologies motivated by this vision. Our system automatically extracts a high-level dataflow graph from a data analysis. This graph describes how data flows through an analysis pipeline, including which statistical methods are used and how they fit together. The system requires no special annotations from the data analyst and consumes analyses written in Python using standard tools, such as Scikit-learn and Statsmodels. In this paper, we explain how our system works and how it fits into our larger vision for a collaborative data science platform.;"[Patterson, E.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [McBurney, R.; Schmidt, H.] Accelerated Cure Project, Waltham, MA 02451 USA; [Baldini, I.; Mojsilovic, A.; Varshney, K.

While the rapidly growing availability of relevant information enables better decisions to be made, it also creates an important challenge: How to find, collect, and categorize this information in a timely manner. To address the problem, we propose a targeted retrieval system that automates these tasks. The system uses historical data collected and labeled by subject matter experts to train a classifier that identifies relevant content. Using this classifier, it deploys a focused crawler to locate and retrieve data at scale. The system also incorporates feedback from subject matter experts to adapt to new concepts and information sources. A novel component of the system is an algorithm for re-crawling that improves the crawler efficiency in retrieving recent data. Our preliminary result shows that the algorithm can increase the freshness of collected data while simultaneously decreasing crawling effort.

An important security requirement is that domain experts and network administrators have a common vocabulary to share security knowledge and quickly help each other respond to new threats. We propose an innovative ontology and graph-based approach for security assessment. An ontology is designed to represent security knowledge such as that of assets, vulnerabilities, and attacks in a common form. Using the inference abilities of the ontological model, an efficient system framework is proposed to generate attack graphs and assess network security. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated on test networks of differing sizes and topologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Fuzzy logic systems are particularly suited for aggregating multiple data to feed multi-variables decision support systems. The aim of the present study was the development of a simple in use and reliable tool based on fuzzy logic multi criteria decision making to objectively classify wine quality based on selected grape attributes. For this purpose, representative berry samples were harvested and vinified for two consecutive years from thirteen commercial vineyards in Nemea, Greece planted with Vitis vinifera cv. Agiorgitiko. Total soluble solids, pH, berry volume, botrytls infection, grape seed colorization, anthocyanin extractability, optical density (OD 520) and skin phenolics (Dpell) were measured at harvest and were used in the tool as inputs. Moreover, the produced wines were sensory evaluated by an experienced and trained panel. The ranking of the vineyards, according to the tasting panel, was compared to the ranking made by the tool and the results showed high general agreement between them suggesting that the latter was able to model expert knowledge successfully. According to the results, the fuzzy logic multi criteria decision making tool could allow the incorporation of grape quality parameters at harvest into a single index providing grape growers and wine producers with a valuable tool for classifying wine quality.;"[Petropoulos, Sofoklis; Kallithraka, Stamatina; Kotseridis, Yiorgos] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Food Sci & Human Nutr, Enol Lab, 75 Iera Odos, GR-11855 Athens, Greece; [Karavas, Christos Spyridon; Balafoutis, Athanasios T.] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Nat Resources Management & Agr Engn, Agr Mechanizat Lab, 75 Iera Odos, GR-11855 Athens, Greece; [Balafoutis, Athanasios T.] Ctr Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Bioecon & Agritechnol, Dimarchou Georgiadou 118, Volos 38221, Greece; [Paraskevopoulos, Ioannis] Technol Educ Inst TEI Athens, Dept Oenol & Beverage Technol, Ag Spyridonos Str, Athens 12210, Greece";Balafoutis, AT (corresponding author), Agr Univ Athens, Dept Nat Resources Management & Agr Engn, Agr Mechanizat Lab, 75 Iera Odos, GR-11855 Athens, Greece.;abalafoutis@aua.gr;;Kallithraka, Stamatina/0000-0002-6590-2035;;;;80;13;13;0;19;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;0168-1699;1872-7107;;COMPUT ELECTRON AGR;Comput.

Over the past four decades, a number of techniques have been developed to measure such control criteria in a non-destructive manner. This paper presents a new comprehensive software developed with MATLAB to help scientists and experts to easily and quickly implement light scattering imaging technology, as a non-invasive tool, in the horticulture and food industry. LightScatter is designed as a user friendly software so that interaction with it is done via a coding-free modern graphical user interface (GUI). This software package is equipped with various advanced tools for image acquisition, image pre-processing, feature extraction, and prediction/classification model generation. LightScatter also provides a powerful tool as a standalone application for use of light scattering imaging in the real-time mode. The latter can be activated manually by the user or automatically by an external trigger signal. The software response can be displayed on the monitor screen or transmitted over a serial port for further analysis or for activating electro-mechanical actuators. By the use of this software, light scattering imaging technology can be implemented in both the stationary mode, like a laboratory monitoring tool, and in the dynamic stop and go measuring mode, like sorting/grading machines.

Both Ki67 and likely tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the near future are determining the kind of systemic therapy. The role of TILs in BC is still an issue for clinical research, albeit preliminary results of neoadjuvant and adjuvant clinical studies already now highlight the crucial impact of TILs on therapy response and survival. Methods: Evaluation of related publications (pubmed) and meeting abstracts (ASCO, SABCS). Results: The monoclonal antibody Ki67 recognizing a nuclear antigene in proliferating cells is a positive marker of therapy response and superior survival. Endocrine responsive tumors of low proliferation (Ki67 < 14%/11%) respond to tamoxifen, in contrast postmenopausal tumors with higher proliferation respond better to aromatase-inhibitors. Pathological complete response (pCR)-rates increase in tumors with higher proliferation (Ki67 > 19%) vs. tumors with lower proliferation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). pCR-rates of up to 60% can be seen in TNBC and HR-, HER2+BC, lower pCR-rates, however, in HR+, HER2- BC. Increased stromal TILs are found in 30% of TNBC and in 19% of HR-, HER2+BC. The percentage of TILs is a significant independent parameter for pCR after NAC. Lymphocyte-predominant BC (LPBC) respond with higher pCR-rates than non-LPBC or tumors without any TILs. Increased TILs in TN and HR-, HER2+ subtypes predict benefit from addition of carboplatin to NAC. TILs are also associated with improved DFS and OS among patients with TNBC and HR-, HER2+ BC. Conversly and interestingly increased TILs in patients with HR+, HER2-(luminal) BC are associated with a 10% higher risk of death per 10% increase of TILs. Interactions between immune system and cancer are complex. The cancer-immunity cycle characterizes these interactions. BC subtypes with higher number of mutations such as TNBC and HR-, HER2+BC are considered to provide a raising number of tumor-associated antigens, thereby capable to build up a higher endogenous immune response. TILs may serve as surrogate marker of both an existing endogenous immune response and the probability to respond to cancer immune therapies. As cancer co-opt immune checkpoint-pathways as a major mechanism of immune resistance, in particular, against cytotoxic T-cells, blockades of checkpoint-pathways by antibodies are one of the goals of the current cancer immunotherapy studies. Therapy studies with antigene-based strategies (vaccines) and antibodies against the immune checkpoints PD-1 and CTLA-4 and their inhibitory pathways in order to enhance cytotoxic T-cell activities against cancer cells with or without chemotherapy are underway. Conclusions: It can be suggested that the use of multigene expression testing will increase in order to select more clearly primary HR+, HER2- BC patients with intermediate recurrence risk who likely may benefit from chemotherapy. Furthermore Ki67 and the multigene expression test Oncotype DX can act as dynamic markers to avoid cytostatic overtreatment and endocrine undertreatment. A data-derived optimal Ki67 cut point for pCR and DFS as well as OS is currently not feasible. The integration of stromal TILs into the immunohisto-pathological report after their evaluation has been standardized is likely helpful to determine patients who profit by additional carboplatin chemotherapy. Oncologists need an enlarged information about the tumor-microenvironment in future. The preliminary results of current BC immunotherapy studies are encouraging.;"[Schlotter, Claus M.; Hahn, Antje] Klinikum Mittelbaden, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Breast Ctr, Balger Str 50, D-76532 Baden Baden, Germany; [Schlotter, Claus M.; Vogt, Ulf] ELA, Roggenkampstr 12, D-49477 Ibbenburen, Germany; [Tietze, Lothar] Ortenau Klinikum Lahr Ettenheim, Inst Pathol, Lahr, Germany; [Heinsen, Carlos Villena] Luzerner Kantonsspital Sursee, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Sursee, Switzerland";"Schlotter, CM; Hahn, A (corresponding author), Klinikum Mittelbaden, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Breast Ctr, Balger Str 50, D-76532 Baden Baden, Germany.; Schlotter, CM (corresponding author), ELA, Roggenkampstr 12, D-49477 Ibbenburen, Germany.";"cschlotter@t-online.de; antje-hahn@gmx.de";;;;;;61;5;5;0;4;WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH;BERLIN;GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY;1868-1883;1868-1891;;HORM MOL BIOL CLIN I;Horm.

Our multi-scale approach blends nested mosaic matrices that capture temporal characteristics of the data, spatial views of the network data, Kiviat diagrams and mirror glyphs that detail the temporal behavior and community assignment of specific nodes. A top design specifically targeted at pairwise visual comparison further supports the comparative analysis of multiple dataset activations.

However, it is not clear when these options should be considered. We reviewed a multicenter experience with TEA in the management of VT storm to determine its optimal therapeutic use. Methods and Results-Data for 11 patients in whom TEA was instituted for VT storm between July 2005 and March 2016 were reviewed to determine the clinical characteristics, outcomes, and role in management. The clinical presentation was incessant VT in 7 (64%), with polymorphic VT in 3 (27%) and monomorphic VT in 8 (73%). The underlying conditions were nonischemic cardiomyopathy in 5 (45%), ischemic cardiomyopathy in 3 (27%), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, and cardiac lipoma in 1 (9%) each. Five (45%) had a complete and 1 (9%) had a partial response to TEA; 4 of the complete responders had incessant VT. All 4 patients with a documented response to deep sedation demonstrated a complete response to TEA. Conclusions-More than half of the patients with VT storm in our series responded to TEA. TEA may be effective and should be considered as a therapeutic option in patients with VT storm, especially incessant VT, who are refractory to initial management. Improvement in VT burden with deep sedation may suggest that sympathoexcitation plays a key role in perpetuating VT and predict a positive response to TEA.";"[Do, Duc H.; Bradfield, Jason; Ajijola, Olujimi A.; Vaseghi, Marmar; Boyle, Noel G.; Shivkumar, Kalyanam] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, UCLA Hlth Syst, Cardiac Arrhythmia Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Do, Duc H.; Bradfield, Jason; Ajijola, Olujimi A.; Vaseghi, Marmar; Boyle, Noel G.; Shivkumar, Kalyanam] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, UCLA Hlth Syst, Neurocardiol Ctr Excellence, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Le, John; Rahman, Siamak; Mahajan, Aman] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, UCLA Hlth Syst, Dept Anesthesiol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Nogami, Akihiko] Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan";Shivkumar, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Cardiac Arrhythmia Ctr, 100 UCLA Med Plaza,Ste 660, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;kshivkumar@mednet.ucla.edu;Shivkumar, Kalyanam/AAI-1085-2019;"Shivkumar, Kalyanam/0000-0002-4121-1766; Ajijola, Olujimi/0000-0001-6197-7593; Nogami, Akihiko/0000-0003-0359-4601";"UCLA Specialty Training and Advanced Research Program; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 HL084261, OT2O023848]; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, DP2HL132356, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895, T32HL007895] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";Dr. Do is supported in prat by an award from the UCLA Specialty Training and Advanced Research Program.

Thus, the need for an easy to use tool to produce landscape patterns similar to real landscapes in this area is imminent. In this article, we aimed at introducing SG4GISCAME as a tool to meet this purpose by exploring it capabilities to generate landscapes similar to real agricultural landscapes of the Vea catchment area in Ghana in three steps. We used Voronoi tessellation polygons to develop the image patterns. The resulting artificial patterns were subsequently evaluated through a visual and landscape structural metric comparison between the simulated and real landscapes. Finally, we used a modified Turing Test to test the credibility of SG4GISCAME model output through expert pattern identification cues. The results show that SG4GISCAME can successfully generate agricultural landscape mosaics similar to real landscape under different parameters and user specifications. We attribute this to the tools' intuitive and interactive user interface. Statistical test outcomes of the modified Turing Test suggested that geographic information systems and remote sensing map experts found marked pattern similarities between real and synthesis maps, resulting in challenges in identifying real maps from synthetic ones.

A large quantity of heterogeneous and distributed data has been produced on phytoplankton traits and their use could be made more effective and efficient if data harmonization and interoperability would be improved. The use of controlled vocabularies and thesauri is an acknowledged good practice to establish the foundation for semantic interoperability, a critical requirement for reuse and sharing of data. In fact, thesauri, collectively constructed, bypass ambiguity issues in natural language, facilitating the identification and integration of the information available in multiple data sources and allowing both scientists and computer applications to interpret more effectively the meaning of data. Here we present a semantic resource on phytoplankton functional traits: the PhytoTraits thesaurus (http://thesauri.lifewatchitaly.eu/PhytoTraits/index.php). PhytoTraits is the result of the interdisciplinary collaboration of experts both from the phytoplankton functional domain and from information and communication technologies, working together within LifeWatch Italy, the Italian node of the e-science European infrastructure for biodiversity and ecosystem research. PhytoTraits is the first initiative to deal with the semantics of phytoplankton functional traits, focusing on morpho-functional traits towards standardized bio-volume assessment. It reflects the agreement of a scientific expert community to fix semantic properties (e.g. label, definition) of approximately 120 traits. Following semantic web standard technologies, the thesaurus was implemented in Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), a common data model based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF). PhytoTraits is freely available online, it can be queried through a SPARQL endpoint (http://thesauri.lifewatchitaly.eu/PhytoTraits/sparql.php) and is also accessible via API (http://thesauri.lifewatchitaly.eu/PhytoTraits/services.php) for integration with other systems. If adopted as a standard and rigorously applied and enriched by the scientific community, PhytoTraits, providing harmonized concepts with associated unique and resolvable URIs, has the potential to significantly reduce the barriers to data discovery, integration, and exchange.;"[Rosati, Ilaria; Bergami, Caterina; Tagliolato, Paolo; Oggioni, Alessandro; Fiore, Nicola; Pugnetti, Alessandra; Zingone, Adriana; Boggero, Angela; Basset, Alberto] LifeWatch Italy, Lecce, Italy; [Rosati, Ilaria; Bergami, Caterina] CNR, Inst Agroenvironm & Forest Biol, IBAF, Via Salaria Km 29,300, I-00015 Rome, Italy; [Rosati, Ilaria; Stanca, Elena; Fiore, Nicola; Basset, Alberto] Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, Prov Le Lecce Monteroni, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Bergami, Caterina] CNR, Inst Marine Sci, ISMAR, Via Gobetti 101, I-40129 Bologna, Italy; [Roselli, Leonilde] Dept Lecce, Environm Protect Agcy Puglia Reg, Via Miglietta 2, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Tagliolato, Paolo; Oggioni, Alessandro] CNR, Inst Electromagnet Sensing Environm, IREA, Via Bassini 15, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Tagliolato, Paolo; Pugnetti, Alessandra] CNR, Inst Marine Sci, ISMAR, Arsenale Tesa 104,Castello 2737-F, I-30122 Venice, Italy; [Zingone, Adriana] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Dept Integrat Marine Ecol, Villa Comunale, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Boggero, Angela] CNR, ISE, Largo Tonolli 50-52, I-28922 Verbania, Italy";"Rosati, I (corresponding author), LifeWatch Italy, Lecce, Italy.; Rosati, I (corresponding author), CNR, Inst Agroenvironm & Forest Biol, IBAF, Via Salaria Km 29,300, I-00015 Rome, Italy.; Rosati, I (corresponding author), Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, Prov Le Lecce Monteroni, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.";ilaria.rosati@cnr.it;"Oggioni, Alessandro/X-8590-2019; Zingone, Adriana/E-4518-2010; Bergami, Caterina/AAX-4058-2020; Pugnetti, Alessandra/AAX-3984-2020; Fiore, Nicola/L-5044-2019; D'Aragona, Paolo Tagliolato Acquaviva/P-9577-2018; Rosati, Ilaria/Y-4617-2019; Bergami, Caterina/F-8888-2016; Boggero, Angela/F-2950-2016";"Oggioni, Alessandro/0000-0002-7997-219X; Zingone, Adriana/0000-0001-5946-6532; Bergami, Caterina/0000-0002-5284-1317; Fiore, Nicola/0000-0002-9538-2966; D'Aragona, Paolo Tagliolato Acquaviva/0000-0002-0261-313X; Rosati, Ilaria/0000-0003-3422-7230; Bergami, Caterina/0000-0002-5284-1317; PUGNETTI, ALESSANDRA/0000-0002-7346-6675; Roselli, Leonilde/0000-0002-0002-9415; Boggero, Angela/0000-0002-7534-3126";LifeWatch Italy, the Italian node of the e-science European infrastructure for biodiversity and ecosystem research;This work was funded by LifeWatch Italy, the Italian node of the e-science European infrastructure for biodiversity and ecosystem research.

However, over the past 30 years, talent has been studied extensively in other domains. The objectives of this study is to explore notions of talent in surgery and sport in order to investigate if the field of surgical education can benefit from expanding its view on talented performances. Therefore, this study aims to use the sport literature as a lens when exploring how surgeons conceptualize and define talent. DESIGN: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of 11 consultant surgeons from multiple specialties. We used constructivist grounded theory principles to explore talent in surgery. Ongoing data analysis refined the theoretical framework and iteratively informed data collection. Themes were identified iteratively using constant comparison. SETTING: The setting included 8 separate hospitals across Canada and Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 11 consultant surgeons from 6 different surgical subspecialties (urology, orthopedic surgery, colorectal surgery, general surgery, vascular surgery, head & neck surgery) were included. RESULTS: We identified three key elements for conceptualizing surgical talent: (1) Individual skills makes the surgical prospect good, (2) a mixture of skills gives the surgical prospect the potential to become talented, and (3) becoming talented may rely on the fit between person and environment. CONCLUSION: We embarked on a study aimed at understanding talent in surgery. Talent is a difficult construct to agree on. Whether in medicine or sports, debates about talent will continue to persist, as we all perceive talent differently. While we heard different opinions, three key ideas summarize our participants' discussions regarding surgical talent. These findings resonate with the holistic ecological approach from sport science and hence highlight the limits of a reductionist approach while favoring the individual-environment system as the minimal ontology for describing talented performances (C) 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Training is typically performed using manikins that do not simulate anatomical variations such as obesity and abnormal vessel positioning. The goal of this study was to develop and validate the effectiveness of a new virtual reality and force haptic based simulation platform for CVC of the right internal jugular vein. DESIGN: A CVC simulation platform was developed using a haptic robotic arm, 3D position tracker, and computer visualization. The haptic robotic arm simulated needle insertion force that was based on cadaver experiments. The 3D position tracker was used as a mock ultrasound device with realistic visualization on a computer screen. Upon completion of a practice simulation, performance feedback is given to the user through a graphical user interface including scoring factors based on good CVC practice. The effectiveness of the system was evaluated by training 13 first year surgical residents using the virtual reality haptic based training system over a 3 month period. RESULTS: The participants' performance increased from 52% to 96% on the baseline training scenario, approaching the average score of an expert surgeon: 98%. This also resulted in improvement in positive CVC practices including a 61% decrease between final needle tip position and vein center, a decrease in mean insertion attempts from 1.92 to 1.23, and a 12% increase in time spent aspirating the syringe throughout the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: A virtual reality haptic robotic simulator for CVC was successfully developed. Surgical residents training on the simulation improved to near expert levels after three robotic training sessions. This suggests that this system could act as an effective training device for CVC.

A wide range of different rare conditions has resulted in a myriad of studies investigating the specificities of the diagnosis in focus. The shared psychological experiences of individuals with a rare condition, however, have not been reviewed systematically. Methods We performed a systematic review, including qualitative studies on adults, published between 2000 and 2016. Papers including more than one rare genetic or nongenetic diagnosis were included. Studies based on single diagnoses were excluded except for four specific conditions: hemophilia (bleeding disorder), phenylketonuria (metabolic disorder), Fabry disease (lysosomal storage disorder), and epidermolysis bullosa (skin disorder). Results The review identified 21 studies. Findings were synthesized and categorized according to three main themes: (1) Consequences of living with a rare disorder, (2) Social aspects of living with a rare disorder, and (3) Experiences with the health care system. Findings point to several unique challenges, such as the psychological, medical, and social consequences of a lack of knowledge about the condition in health care and social settings. Conclusion The findings highlight the need for more research on the shared psychological and social impact of living with a rare diagnosis across conditions, in order to identify risk factors and inform clinical practice.;"[von der Lippe, Charlotte; Diesen, Plata S.; Feragen, Kristin B.] Oslo Univ Hosp, Rikshosp, Ctr Rare Disorders, PB 4950 Nydalen, N-0424 Oslo, Norway";von der Lippe, C (corresponding author), Oslo Univ Hosp, Rikshosp, Ctr Rare Disorders, PB 4950 Nydalen, N-0424 Oslo, Norway.;uxhelc@ous-hf.no;;;;;;64;38;38;0;7;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;2324-9269;;;MOL GENET GENOM MED;Mol.

Many intervention programs try to reduce the injury rate by instructing athletes to land more safely. Video is an effective way to provide feedback, but little is known about its influence on landing technique in sport-specific situations. Objective: To test the effectiveness of a video-overlay feedback method on landing technique in elite handball players. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Setting: Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 16 elite female handball players assigned to a control group (n = 8; age = 17.61 +/- 1.34 years, height = 1.73 +/- 0.06 m, mass = 69.55 +/- 4.29 kg) or video group (n = 8; age = 17.81 +/- 0.86 years, height = 1.71 +/- 0.03 m, mass = 64.28 +/- 6.29 kg). Intervention(s): Both groups performed jump shots in a pretest, 2 training sessions, and a posttest. The video group received video feedback of an expert model with an overlay of their own jump shots in training sessions 1 and 2, whereas the control group did not. Main Outcome Measure(s): We measured ankle, knee, and hip angles in the sagittal plane at initial contact and peak flexion; range of motion; and Landing Error Scoring System (LESS) scores. One 2 x 4 repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to analyze the group, time, and interaction effects of all kinematic outcome measures and the LESS score. Results: The video group improved knee and hip flexion at initial contact and peak flexion and range of motion. In addition, the group's average peak ankle flexion (12.0 degrees at pretest to 21.8 degrees at posttest) and LESS score (8.1 pretest to 4.0 posttest) improved. When we considered performance variables, no differences between groups were found in shot accuracy or vertical jump height, whereas horizontal jump distance in the video group increased over time. Conclusions: Overlay visual feedback is an effective method for improving landing kinematics during a sport-specific jump shot.

The limitation of the LESS is that raters identify movement errors from video replay, which is time-consuming and, therefore, may limit its use by clinicians. A markerless motion-capture system may be capable of automating LESS scoring, thereby removing this obstacle. Objective: To determine the reliability of an automated markerless motion-capture system for scoring the LESS. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: United States Military Academy. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 57 healthy, physically active individuals (47 men, 10 women; age = 18.6 +/- 0.6 years, height = 174.5 +/- 6.7 cm, mass = 75.9 +/- 9.2 kg). Main Outcome Measure(s): Participants completed 3 jump-landing trials that were recorded by standard video cameras and a depth camera. Their movement quality was evaluated by expert LESS raters (standard video recording) using the LESS rubric and by software that automates LESS scoring (depth-camera data). We recorded an error for a LESS item if it was present on at least 2 of 3 jump-landing trials. We calculated kappa statistics, prevalence-and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) statistics, and percentage agreement for each LESS item. Interrater reliability was evaluated between the 2 expert rater scores and between a consensus expert score and the markerless motion-capture system score. Results: We observed reliability between the 2 expert LESS raters (average kappa = 0.45 +/- 0.35, average PABAK = 0.67 +/- 0.34; percentage agreement = 0.83 +/- 0.17). The markerless motion-capture system had similar reliability with consensus expert scores (average kappa = 0.48 +/- 0.40, average PABAK = 0.71 +/- 0.27; percentage agreement = 0.85 +/- 0.14). However, reliability was poor for 5 LESS items in both LESS score comparisons. Conclusions: A markerless motion-capture system had the same level of reliability as expert LESS raters, suggesting that an automated system can accurately assess movement. Therefore, clinicians can use the markerless motion-capture system to reliably score the LESS without being limited by the time requirements of manual LESS scoring.";"[Mauntel, Timothy C.; Padua, Darin A.; Stanley, Laura E.; Frank, Barnett S.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Exercise & Sport Sci, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [DiStefano, Lindsay J.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Kinesiol, Storrs, CT USA; [Peck, Karen Y.; Cameron, Kenneth L.] Keller Army Community Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, West Point, NY USA; [Marshall, Stephen W.] Univ N Carolina, Injury Prevent Res Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Mauntel, Timothy C.] Walter Reed Natl Mil Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed, 8901 Wisconsin Ave,Bldg 19,Rm 2017, Bethesda, MD 20889 USA";Mauntel, TC (corresponding author), Walter Reed Natl Mil Med Ctr, Dept Orthopaed, 8901 Wisconsin Ave,Bldg 19,Rm 2017, Bethesda, MD 20889 USA.;tmauntel@gmail.com;;Cameron, Kenneth/0000-0002-6276-4482;;;;30;9;9;1;11;NATL ATHLETIC TRAINERS ASSOC INC;DALLAS;2952 STEMMONS FREEWAY, DALLAS, TX 75247 USA;1062-6050;1938-162X;;J ATHL TRAINING;J.

Allergen immunotherapy (AIT), has increasingly been used as a treatment for allergic rhinitis (AR) globally, as it has been shown to provide a long-term effect in improving nasal and ocular symptoms, reducing medication need, and improving quality of life. AIT is currently the only curative intervention that can potentially modify the immune system in individuals suffering from AR and prevent the development of new sensitization and the progression of disease from AR to asthma. Although the use of AIT is becoming more acceptable in China, to date no AR immunotherapy guideline from China is available for use by the international community. This document has thus been produced and covers the main aspects of AIT undertaken in China; including selection of patients for AIT, the allergen extracts available on the Chinese market, schedules and doses of allergen employed in different routes of AIT, assessment of effect and safety, patients' administration and follow-up, and management of adverse reactions. The Chinese guideline for AR immunotherapy will thus serve as a reference point by doctors, healthcare professionals and organizations involved in the AIT of AR in China. Moreover, this guideline will serve as a source of information for the international community on AIT treatment strategies employed in China.";"[Bao, Yixiao; Wang, Chengshuo; Wang, Yihui] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Pubin Children Hosp, Shanghai Children Med Ctr, Dept Pediat Resp Med,Sch Med, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jianjun; Kong, Weijia; Zhou, Yue] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Union Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Tongji Med Coll, Wuhan 430022, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Lei; Liu, Lin] Nanjing Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Lei] Nanjing Med Univ, Int Ctr Allergy Res, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yinshi] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Renji Hosp, Dept Allergy & Immunol, Shanghai 200127, Peoples R China; [Hong, Suling] Chongqing Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Chongqing 400016, Peoples R China; [Lai, He] Guangzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Allergy, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Houyong; Li, Huabin] Fudan Univ, Affiliated Eye Ear Nose & Throat Hosp, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Shanghai 200031, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing] Guangzhou Med Univ, State Key Lab Resp Dis Allergy & Clin Immunol, Affiliated Hosp 1, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Tianying; Chen, Dehua; Hong, Haiyu] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Otolaryngol, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiaoping] PLA Ctr Resp & Allerg Dis Diagnosing & Management, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shixi; Meng, Juan] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Dept Otolaryngol, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zheng; Wang, Nan] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Wuhan 430030, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Lou, Hongfei; Wang, Chengshuo; Wang, Xiangdong; Zhang, Yuan; Meng, Yifan; Zhang, Luo] Capital Med Univ, Beijing TongRen Hosp, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Lou, Hongfei; Wang, Chengshuo; Wang, Xiangdong; Zhang, Yuan; Meng, Yifan; Zhang, Luo] Beijing Inst Otolaryngol, Beijing Key Lab Nasal Dis, Beijing 100005, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Qianhui] Southern Med Univ, Zhujiang Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Guangzhou 510282, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Shen, Kunling] Capital Med Univ, Beijing Childrens Hosp, Dept Pediat Resp Med, Natl Ctr Childrens Hlth, Beijing 100045, Peoples R China; [Tang, Wei] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Med, Shanghai Ruijin Hosp, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med, Shanghai 200025, Peoples R China; [Tao, Zezhang; Xu, Yu] Wuhan Univ, Renmin Hosp, Dept Otolaryngol, Wuhan 430060, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wei, Qingyu; Li, Quansheng] PLA, Hosp 202, Dept Allergy, Shenyang 110003, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Li] Capital Med Univ, Beijing Childrens Hosp, Natl Ctr Childrens Hlth, Dept Allergy, Beijing 100045, Peoples R China; [Xie, Hua] Shenyang Mil Reg, Gen Hosp, Dept Resp Med, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Gehua] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 3, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Yiwu] ALK, Sci Affairs, Guangzhou 510300, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhi, Yuxiang] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Peking Union Med Coll Hosp, Dept Allergy, Beijing 100720, Peoples R China; [Zhi, Yuxiang] Peking Union Med Coll, Beijing 100720, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Luo] Capital Med Univ, Beijing TongRen Hosp, Dept Allergy, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China";Zhang, L (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Otolaryngol, 17 HouGouHuTong, Beijing 100005, Peoples R China.;dr.luozhang@139.com;;;"National Key R & D Program of China [2016YFC20160905200]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research TeamProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT13082]; National Natural Science Fund for the Major International Joint Research Program [81420108009]; National Natural Science FundNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81630023, 81100704, 81400444, 81441029, 81441031, 81570894]; Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals' Mission Plan [SML20150203]";This work was supported by grants to L Zhang from National Key R & D Program of China (2016YFC20160905200), the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team (IRT13082), the National Natural Science Fund for the Major International Joint Research Program (81420108009), the National Natural Science Fund (81630023, 81100704, 81400444, 81441029, 81441031 and 81570894), and Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals' Mission Plan (SML20150203).;;283;13;23;0;37;AME PUBL CO;SHATIN;FLAT-RM C 16F, KINGS WING PLAZA 1, NO 3 KWAN ST, SHATIN, HONG KONG 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA;2072-1439;2077-6624;;J THORAC DIS;J.

Whether such a stringent standard for expert testimony is beneficial or detrimental to the American justice system is still under fierce debate, but there has been scant economic analysis of this issue. This paper attempts to fill the gap by presenting a game-theoretic argument showing that a stringent admissibility standard operates to increase the accuracy of judicial decision-making in certain situations. More precisely, when the judge faces uncertainty regarding an expert's quality, the admissibility standard may provide the judge with information about the quality of expert testimony, thereby increasing the accuracy of judicial decision-making by mitigating the judge's inference problem. I show the ways in which this effect dominates at trial and discuss related issues.;[Kim, Chulyoung] Yonsei Univ, Seoul, South Korea;Kim, C (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Seoul, South Korea.;;;Kim, Chulyoung/0000-0001-8921-3288;Yonsei University Future-leading Research Initiative [2016-22-0048];I am grateful to two anonymous referees for comments that substantially improved this paper.

Wound dressings are one of the first lines of defense in wound management, and numerous options exist. The oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC)/collagen dressing may offer healthcare providers a robust and cost-effective tool for use in a variety of wounds. DESIGN: A multidisciplinary panel meeting was convened to discuss the use of ORC/collagen dressings in wound care and provide practice recommendations. A literature search was conducted to provide a brief review of the peer-reviewed studies published between January 2000 and March 2016 to inform the meeting. SETTING: A 2-day panel meeting convened in February 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare providers with experience using ORC/collagen dressings. This multidisciplinary panel of 15 experts in wound healing included podiatrists, wound care specialists (doctors, certified wound care nurses, and research scientists), and an orthopedist. RESULTS: The literature search identified 58 articles, a majority of which were low levels of evidence (69.3% were level 3 or lower). Panel members identified wound types, such as abrasions, burns, stalled wounds, diabetic foot ulcers, and pressure injuries, where ORC/collagen dressing use could be beneficial. Panel members then provided recommendations and technical pearls for the use of ORC/collagen dressings in practice. Barriers to ORC/collagen dressing use were discussed, and potential resolutions were offered. CONCLUSIONS: An ORC/collagen dressing can be a critical tool for clinicians to help manage a variety of wounds. Clinical and economic studies comparing standard-of-care dressings and plain collagen dressings to ORC/collagen dressings are needed.;"[Wu, Stephanie] Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Surg, Dr William M Sch Coll Podiatr Med, Ctr Lower Extrem Ambulatory Res CLEAR, N Chicago, IL USA; [Applewhite, Andrew J.] Baylor Univ, Med Ctr, Comprehens Wound Care & Hyperbar Ctr, Dallas, TX USA; [Niezgoda, Jeffrey] Adv Zenith Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI USA; [Snyder, Robert] Barry Univ, Clin Res, Sch Podiatr Med, North Miami Beach, FL USA; [Shah, Jayesh] South Texas Wound Associated PA, San Antonio, TX USA; [Cullen, Breda] Systagenix, Gargrave, England; [Schultz, Gregory] Univ Florida, Coll Med, Gainesville, FL USA; [Harrison, Janis] Harrison WOC Serv LLC, Thurston, NE USA; [Hill, Rosemary] Lions Gate Hosp, N Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Howell, Melania] Dynam Wound Care Solut LLC, Turlock, CA USA; [Speyrer, Marcus] Opelousas Gen Hlth Syst, Wound Treatment Ctr LLC, Opelousas, LA USA; [Utra, Howard] Innovated Healing Syst, Tampa, FL USA; [de Leon, Jean] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Lee, Wayne] Hill Country Orthopaed Surg & Sports Med, San Antonio, TX USA; [Treadwell, Terry] Baptist Med Ctr, Inst Adv Wound Care, Montgomery, AL USA";Wu, S (corresponding author), Rosalind Franklin Univ Med & Sci, Surg, Dr William M Sch Coll Podiatr Med, Ctr Lower Extrem Ambulatory Res CLEAR, N Chicago, IL USA.;;Harrison, Janis/T-1366-2019;;ACELITY;"The authors thank Ricardo Martinez and Julie M.

J;Bouchard, JP;;;;Bouchard, Jean-Pierre;;;Proposal for the reform of the training of psychologists: From the division in the Master's degree to harmonisation with the introduction of a generalist Doctorate;ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES;;;French;Article;;;;;;"Doctorate; Expert; Expertise; Psychologist; Psychology; Psychotherapist; Reform; Training";;"Psychologists: a profession in high demand that requires training reforms-In France, as in many other countries, the number of psychologists has been in constant growth to the point that they now account for by far the largest number of professionals in the psy family. Demand for psychologists' services has also risen significantly in remarkably varied sectors over the last few years. Despite this development, which is likely to intensify, psychologists' initial training in the Master's system remains highly uneven in France. It is segmented into too many different high education courses, many of which are ill adapted to the legitimate expectations of clients (be it individual clients or institutions). Across dozens of different courses, the teaching and the learning processes are all different, or at least partially different. Dividing up the profession in this way deprives future psychologists of general theoretical and practical knowledge, which are indispensable to working in the field. Reform and harmonise the training of psychologists by adopting one single course and one single doctorate in psychology-The current situation means that it is important to reform the way that psychologists are trained as soon as possible by prolonging, updating, homogenising, adapting the process to current knowledge and needs, and finally by recognising it with one single and clear title: the doctorate. This reformed course and doctorate, which could include an internship in psychology, should combine training with professional experience, research and teaching. It is uniquely through the framework of a more general doctorate-and not through the multiplication of options-that each potential psychologist might receive training that is relevant across the board, useful, of a high standard and one which incorporates all of the fields of application in the discipline (education, health, justice, social, work, transport, sport, teaching, research, etc.). A reform based on the excellence of training and services provided-The problem is constantly getting worse and is particularly evident in the French system. The situation can be summarised thus; it is essential that we train far fewer psychologists, but it is also imperative that we train them better. The number of psychologists in training could be adapted to both demand and available job opportunities by putting in place a numerus clausus policy for entry into the first year of the Master's degree. This reform should equally be accompanied by an indispensable and significant revision of the selection and skills criteria regarding those who would lead this renovated training program. Another improvement, among many, would be the recruitment of teachers who would be employed as practitioner-teacher-researchers by psychologists who have already proven themselves through their work in the field, their teaching and their contribution to psychological research. Their capacity to train future psychologists for the professional duties that they are likely to undertake (psychological assessments, diagnoses, psycho-therapies, information, prevention, expertise injustice, scholarly or professional orientation, supervision, etc.) should be one of the main criteria in candidates' selection. The reform could also establish a model to follow for the standardisation of the quality of psychologists' training and the services that they provide in the European Union as a whole. This reform, based on the excellence of training and the resulting improvement in services, would also restore and preserve the indispensable unity of the discipline and profession of psychologist, which must be retained beyond the multiplicity of the sectors of intervention and professional exercise. It would make the possibility of entering into internships and of changing sectors during the course of a career easier, as well as improving professional geographic mobility. Finally, it would ensure a much-needed improvement in the quality of service provided for our fellow citizens, along with providing an essential clarification for the psy nebula that exists today.

Hence, a green alternative method for higher yield production of butyl butyrate by esterification reaction utilizing Novozyme 435 as biocatalysts in a solvent-less system may prove useful. Such approach can be further improved by optimizing the relevant reaction parameters using the Response Surface Methodology by the Box-Benkhen Design attempted in this present study. The reaction parameters evaluated were: substrate molar ratio, time and temperature, and the response of each parameter was measured as percentage conversion yield. Using the Design Expert 7.1.6 optimization functions, the two sets of optimum conditions selected viz. [i] molar ratio butyric acid: butanol 1: 3.93, 9.93 h at 56.09 degrees C and [ii] molar ratio butyric acid: butanol 1: 3.35, 9.79 h at 53.90 degrees C had afforded the highest yield of butyl butyrate i.e. 99.62% and 99.55%, respectively. The ester product obtained from the reaction were confirmed as butyl butyrate by FTIR and GC. Therefore, the results substantiated the applicability of the RSM prediction technique as well as efficacy of Novozyme 435 as biocatalysts in the high yield solvent-less synthesis of butyl butyrate, adhering to the philosophy of Green Chemistry.

In surgical care, complication reporting is an essential component of practice-based learning and improvement as complications are analyzed in morbidity and mortality conference for quality improvement. Unfortunately, current methods for capturing a comprehensive profile of complications may significantly underestimate the true occurrence of complications. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to evaluate an intervention for complication reporting and compare this to current practice, in a plastic surgery training program. Methods: This is a preintervention and postintervention study evaluating resident reporting of complications on a plastic surgery service. The intervention was an online event reporting system developed by department leadership and patient safety experts. The cohorts consisted of all patients undergoing surgery during two separate 3-month blocks bridged by an implementation period. A trained reviewer recorded complications, and this served as the reference standard. Fisher's exact test was used for binary comparisons. Results: There were 32 complications detected in 219 patients from June to August of 2015 and 35 complications in 202 patients from October to December of 2015. The proportion of complications reported in the preintervention group was nine of 32 (28.1 percent). After the intervention, this significantly increased to 32 of 35 (91.4 percent) (p < 0.001). Conclusion: An intervention using an event reporting system, supported by departmental leadership, led to significant improvements in complication reporting by plastic surgery residents.;"[Parikh, Rajiv P.; Snyder-Warwick, Alison; Naidoo, Sybill; Skolnick, Gary B.; Patel, Kamlesh B.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Div Plast & Reconstruct Surg, 660 South Euclid Ave,Suite 1150, St Louis, MO 63110 USA";Parikh, RP (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Div Plast & Reconstruct Surg, 660 South Euclid Ave,Suite 1150, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.;parikhr@wustl.edu;NAIDOO, SYBILL/AAF-8653-2019;NAIDOO, SYBILL/0000-0001-5277-8592;"American Association of Plastic Surgeons Academic Peer Scholarship; National Institutes of Health Institutional National Research Service AwardUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [T32CA190194]; Washington University Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences grant from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [UL1 TR000448]; Washington University Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences grant from Children's Discovery Institute [UL1 TR000448]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [T32CA190194, T32CA190194, T32CA190194, T32CA190194, T32CA190194, T32CA190194, T32CA190194] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR000448, UL1TR002345, UL1TR002345, UL1TR002345, UL1TR002345, UL1TR002345, UL1TR000448, UL1TR000448, UL1TR000448, UL1TR002345, UL1TR000448, UL1TR000448, UL1TR000448, UL1TR002345, UL1TR000448, UL1TR000448, UL1TR002345] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [K08NS096232, K08NS096232, K08NS096232, K08NS096232] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";Alison Snyder-Warwick, M.D., is supported in part by the American Association of Plastic Surgeons Academic Peer Scholarship.

STR profiles are routinely used either to associate or exclude potential donors of forensic biological evidence. The typing of forensic reference samples has become more demanding, especially with the requirement in some jurisdictions to DNA profile arrestees. The Rapid DNA (RDNA) platform, the RapidHIT (R) ID (IntegenX (R), Pleasanton, CA), is a fully automated system capable of processing reference samples in approximately 90 min with minimal human intervention. Thus, the RapidHIT ID instrument can be deployed to non-laboratory environments (e.g., booking stations) and run by trained atypical personnel such as law enforcement. In order to implement the RapidHIT ID platform, validation studies are needed to define the performance and limitations of the system. Internal validation studies were undertaken with four early-production RapidHIT ID units. Reliable and concordant STR profiles were obtained from reference buccal swabs. Throughout the study, no contamination was observed. The overall first-pass success rate with an expert-like system was 72%, which is comparable to another current RDNA platform commercially available. The system's second-pass success rate (involving manual interpretation on first-pass inconclusive results) increased to 90%. Inhibitors (i.e., coffee, smoking tobacco, and chewing tobacco) did not appear to affect typing by the instrument system; however, substrate (i.e., swab type) did impact typing success. Additionally, one desirable feature not available with other Rapid systems is that in the event of a system failed run, a swab can be recovered and subsequently re-analyzed in a new sample cartridge. Therefore, rarely should additional sampling or swab consumption be necessary. The RapidHIT ID system is a robust and reliable tool capable of generating complete STR profiles within the forensic DNA typing laboratory or with proper training in decentralized environments by non-laboratory personnel.";"[Wiley, Rachel; Sage, Kelly; Budowle, Bruce] Univ North Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Ctr Human Identificat, 3500 Camp Bowie Blvd, Ft Worth, TX 76107 USA; [LaRue, Bobby] Sam Houston State Univ, Huntsville, TX 77340 USA; [Budowle, Bruce] King Abdulaziz Univ, CEGMR, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia";Wiley, R (corresponding author), Univ North Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, 3500 Camp Bowie Blvd, Ft Worth, TX 76107 USA.;Rachel.Wiley@my.unthsc.edu;;Budowle, Bruce/0000-0003-4116-2930;;;;12;3;3;0;7;ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD;CLARE;ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND;1872-4973;1878-0326;;FORENSIC SCI INT-GEN;Forensic Sci.

However, the analysis of these data has emerged as the greatest challenge to implementation in forensics. To address this need, a custom toolkit for use in the CLC Genomics Workbench (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was developed through a collaborative effort between the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System - Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFMES-AFDIL) and QIAGEN Bioinformatics. The AFDIL-QIAGEN mtDNA Expert, or AQME, generates an editable mtDNA profile that employs forensic conventions and includes the interpretation range required for mtDNA data reporting. AQME also integrates an mtDNA haplogroup estimate into the analysis workflow, which provides the analyst with phylogenetic nomenclature guidance and a profile quality check without the use of an external tool. Supplemental AQME outputs such as nucleotide-per-position metrics, configurable export files, and an audit trail are produced to assist the analyst during review. AQME is applied to standard CLC outputs and thus can be incorporated into any mtDNA bioinformatics pipeline within CLC regardless of sample type, library preparation or NGS platform. An evaluation of AQME was performed to demonstrate its functionality and reliability for the analysis of mitogenome NGS data. The study analyzed Illumina mitogenome data from 21 samples (including associated controls) of varying quality and sample preparations with the AQME toolkit. A total of 211 tool edits were automatically applied to 130 of the 698 total variants reported in an effort to adhere to forensic nomenclature. Although additional manual edits were required for three samples, supplemental tools such as mtDNA haplogroup estimation assisted in identifying and guiding these necessary modifications to the AQME-generated profile. Along with profile generation, AQME reported accurate haplogroups for 18 of the 19 samples analyzed. The single errant haplogroup assignment, although phylogenetically close, identified a bug that only affects partial mitogenome data. Future adjustments to AQME's haplogrouping tool will address this bug as well as enhance the overall scoring strategy to better refine and automate haplogroup assignments. As NGS enables broader use of the mtDNA locus in forensics, the availability of AQME and other forensic-focused mtDNA analysis tools will ease the transition and further support mitogenome analysis within routine casework. Toward this end, the AFMES-AFDIL has utilized the AQME toolbox in conjunction with the CLC Genomics Workbench to successfully validate and implement two NGS mitogenome methods.;"[Sturk-Andreaggi, Kimberly; Peck, Michelle A.; McMahon, Timothy P.; Marshall, Charla K.] Armed Forces DNA Identificat Lab, 115 Purple Heart Dr, Dover AFB, DE 19902 USA; [Sturk-Andreaggi, Kimberly; Peck, Michelle A.; Marshall, Charla K.] ARP Sci LLC, Contractor Supporting Armed Forces Med Examiner S, 9210 Corp Blvd,Suite 120, Rockville, MD 20850 USA; [Boysen, Cecilie; Dekker, Patrick] QIAGEN Bioinformat, Silkeborgvej 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Boysen, Cecilie] PACT Pharma, 3928 Point Eden Way, Hayward, CA 94545 USA; [Dekker, Patrick] KeyGene NV, Agro Business Pk 90, NL-6708 PW Wageningen, Netherlands";Sturk-Andreaggi, K (corresponding author), Armed Forces DNA Identificat Lab, 115 Purple Heart Dr, Dover AFB, DE 19902 USA.;kimberly.s.andreaggi.ctr@mail.mil;;Andreaggi, Kimberly/0000-0001-6857-923X;;;;32;15;15;1;13;ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD;CLARE;ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND;1872-4973;1878-0326;;FORENSIC SCI INT-GEN;Forensic Sci.

Increasing the performance of such recognition systems is of high importance and always poses a challenge. In this study, a new community based decision making system is proposed which aims at increasing the efficiency of NER systems in the chemical/drug name context. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is chosen as the expert selection strategy along with the Bayesian combination method to merge the outputs of the selected classifiers as well as evaluate the fitness of the selected candidates. The proposed system performs in two steps. The first step focuses on creating various numbers of baseline classifiers for NER with different features sets using the Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). The second step involves the selection and efficient combination of the classifiers using PSO and Bayesisan combination. Two comprehensive corpora from BioCreative events, namely ChemDNER and CEMP, are used for the experiments conducted. Results show that the ensemble of classifiers selected by means of the proposed approach perform better than the single best classifier as well as ensembles formed using other popular selection/combination strategies for both corpora. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms the best performing system at the Biocreative IV ChemDNER track by achieving an F-score of 87.95 percent.;"[Akkasi, Abbas; Varoglu, Ekrem] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey";Akkasi, A (corresponding author), Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey.;"Abbas.Akkasi@gmail.com; Ekrem.Varoglu@emu.edu.tr";Akkasi, Abbas/T-9761-2019;;;;;54;1;1;0;8;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1545-5963;1557-9964;;IEEE ACM T COMPUT BI;IEEE-ACM Trans.

The proposed approach extracts the contours in the ultrasound images using gradient vector flow snakes with an improved snake initialization process. The seed points for this improved snake initialization process are extracted using selected edges returned by the candidate line-selection algorithm. Intima media thickness is calculated from the extracted contours. The proposed approach is tested and clinically validated on a data set of 100 longitudinal ultrasound images of the carotid artery. There is no significant difference between intima media thickness measurements obtained using the proposed approach and the manual measurements. The intra-observer error of 0.088, a coefficient of variation of 12.99 %, Bland-Altman plots with small differences between experts (0.01 and 0.03 for Expert1 and Expert2, respectively) and figure of merit of 98.5 % are obtained.

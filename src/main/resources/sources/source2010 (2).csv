The work in this paper is directed toward filling that gap by extending existing formal models of deliberation dialog to analyze four examples of deliberation dialog where burden of proof is at issue or poses an interesting problem. The examples are used to show (1) that the eight stages in the formal model of Hitchcock, McBurney and Parsons (2007) need to be divided into three more general stages, an opening stage, an argumentation stage and a closing stage, (2) that deliberation dialog shifts to persuasion dialog during the argumentation stage, and (3) that burden of proof is only operative during the argumentation stage. What is shown in general is that deliberation is, in the typical type of case, a mixed dialog in which there is a shift to persuasion dialog in the middle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-12804-2;;;;2010;6057;;;;;;1;22;;;;;;;;;WOS:000280471900001;;;;;;

However, even if computational models of arguments are used to encompass the reasoning of interacting agents, this logical approach does not come with an effective strategy for agents engaged in negotiations. In this paper we propose a realisation of the Minimal Concession (MC) strategy which has been theoretically validated. The main contribution of this paper is the integration of this intelligent strategy in a practical application by means of assumption-based argumentation. We claim here that the outcome of negotiations, which are guaranteed to terminate, is an optimal agreement (when possible) if the agents adopt the MC strategy.;;;;;MORGE, Maxime/0000-0003-2139-7150;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-12804-2;;;;2010;6057;;;;;;114;133;;;;;;;;;WOS:000280471900007;;;;;;

Our method draws from an existing model of T-cell cross-regulation in the vertebrate immune system (IS), which is a complex adaptive system of millions of cells interacting to distinguish between harmless and harmful intruders. Analogously, automatic biomedical article classification assumes that the interaction and co-occurrence of thousands of words in text can be used to identify conceptually-related classes of articles at a minimum, two classes with relevant and irrelevant articles for a given concept (e.g. articles with protein-protein interaction information). Our agent-based method for document classification expands the existing analytical model of Carneiro et al. [1], by allowing us to deal simultaneously with many distinct T-cell features (epitomes) and their collective dynamics using agent based modeling. We already extended this model to develop a bio-inspired spam-detection system [2, 3]. Here we develop our agent-base model further, and test it on a dataset of publicly available full-text biomedical articles provided by the BioCreative challenge [4]. We study several new parameter configurations leading to encouraging results comparable to state-of-the-art classifiers. These results help us understand both T-cell cross-regulation and its applicability to document classification in general. Therefore, we show that our bio-inspired algorithm is a promising novel method for biomedical article classification and for binary document classification in general.;;;;;Rocha, Luis/0000-0001-9402-887X;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;978-3-642-14546-9;;;;2010;6209;;;;;;237;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000285700300019;;;;;;

For creating expressive performance, a rehearsal program is adopted to this system. By the rehearsal program, the system learns the tendency of the expression that the human performer thinks and/or plans. To do so, the program records his/her performance of solo and calculates the tendency, which depends on not only the performer but also the composition of music itself. Hence, it is necessary for the expressive performance to analyze the score of the composition and to experiment dependent on it. This system is an example of intelligent realtime programs appropriate for formal verification and analysis. N Sigma-labeled calculus is a formal system for verification for such time-concerned programs. In this paper, a logical specification and experimental results for an expressive ensemble system will be introduced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-16529-0;;;;2010;6319;;;;;;256;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000292891700031;;;;;;

The results obtained from testing are usually taken as an estimate of the behavior of automatic recognition system in presence of unknown input in the future. This paper investigates and discusses the, consequences of the non-uniform representation of the medical knowledge in such clinically-derived experimental sets. Additional challenges come from the nonlinear representation of the patient status in particular parameters' domain and from the uncertainty of the reference provided usually by human experts. The presented solution consists of representation of all available cases in multidimensional diagnostic parameters or patient status spaces. This provides the option for independent linearization of selected dimensions. The recruitment to the learning set is then based on the case-to-case distance as selection criterion. In result, the classifier may be trained and tested in a more suitable way to cope with unpredicted patterns.;;;;Augustyniak, Piotr/C-6448-2013;Augustyniak, Piotr/0000-0001-5986-3247;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-13207-0;;;;2010;6113;;;;;;581;588;;;;;;;;;WOS:000281606000072;;;;;;

The complexity of software systems has limited the application of AI techniques in many real world applications. This talk provides an insight into applications of AT techniques in software engineering and how innovative application of AT can assist in achieving ever competitive and firm schedules for software development projects as well as Information Technology (IT) management. The pros and cons of using AT techniques are investigated and specifically the application of AT in IT management, software application development and software security is considered. Organisations that build software applications do so in an environment characterised by limited resources, increased pressure to reduce cost and development schedules. Organisations demand to build software applications adequately and quickly. One approach to achieve this is to use automated software development tools from the very initial stage of software design up to the software testing and installation. Considering software testing as an example, automated software systems can assist in most software testing phases. On the hand data security, availability, privacy and integrity are very important issues in the success of a business operation. Data security and privacy policies in business are governed by business requirements and government regulations. AT can also assist in software security, privacy and reliability. Implementing data security using data encryption solutions remain at the forefront for data security. Many solutions to data encryption at this level are expensive, disruptive and resource intensive. AI can be used for data classification in organizations. It can assist in identifying and encrypting only the relevant data thereby saving time and processing power. Without data classification organizations using encryption process would simply encrypt everything and consequently impact users more than necessary. Data classification is essential and can assist organizations with their data security, privacy and accessibility needs. This talk explores the use of AT techniques (such as fuzzy logic) for data classification and suggests a method that can determine requirements for classification of organizations' data for security and privacy based on organizational needs and government policies.

However, these methods require significant computational resources (large transition models, huge amounts of samples) and the resulting representations can hardly be broken into easily understood parts, even for deterministic or near-deterministic domains. This paper focuses on a rule induction method for (near-)deterministic domains, so that an unknown world can be described by a set of short rules with well-defined preconditions and effects given a brief interaction with the environment. The extracted rules can then be used by the agent for decision making. We have selected a multiplayer online game based on the SMAUG MUD server as a model of a near-deterministic domain and used our approach to infer rules about the world, generalising from a few examples. The agent starts with zero knowledge about the world and tries to explain it by generating hypotheses, refining them as they are refuted. The end result is a set of a few meaningful rules that accurately describe the world. A simple planner using these rules was able to perform near optimally in a fight scenario.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;978-3-642-12841-7;;;;2010;6040;;;;;;339;344;;;;;;;;;WOS:000281445400040;;;;;;

Here, the psychological and semantic problem is establishing an effective operative meaning for 'emotions'. The concept of emotional intelligence then is introduced.

In addition, acquiring the description of the desired behaviour of a system is a complex task in several AI domains. In this paper, we evaluate a neural framework capable of adapting temporal models according to properties, and also learning through observation of examples. In this framework, a symbolically described model is translated into a recurrent neural network, and algorithms are proposed to integrate learning, both from examples and from properties. In the end, the knowledge is again symbolically represented, incorporating both initial model and learned specification, as shown by our case study.

Among the most challenging games is the Asian game of Go, which, despite its deceivingly simple rules, has eluded the development of artificial expert players.

We employ Multi-Dimensional Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory cells to handle the multi-dimensional data of the board game in a very natural way. In order to improve the convergence rate, as well as the ultimate performance, we train those networks using Policy Gradients with Parameter-based Exploration, a recently developed Reinforcement Learning algorithm which has been found to have numerous advantages over Evolution Strategies.

This makes them useless in urban traffic, where most traffic accidents occur. In the present work, a controller for an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system for urban traffic based on ultrasonic sensors is optimized using Genetic Algorithms. The use of ultrasonic sensors limits their operating range to distances and speeds typical of urban traffic. The proposed system uses the distance between vehicles as measured by the ultrasonic sensor to estimate the relative velocity and acceleration, thus requiring no interaction with the electronics of the car, except for the actuation on acceleration and braking systems. The system is capable of acting on the acceleration and braking systems throughout all its operating range, thereby constituting an additional emergency braking system.

However, since SAT constraints are defined over atomic propositions, domains with state variables that change over time can lead to extremely large search spaces. This poses both memory-and time-efficiency problems for existing SAT algorithms. In this paper, we propose to address these problems by introducing a language that encodes the temporal intervals over which relations occur and an integrated system that satisfies constraints formulated in this language. Temporal intervals are presented as a compressed method of encoding time that results in significantly smaller search spaces. However, intervals cannot be used efficiently without significant modifications to traditional SATalgorithms. Using the Polyscheme cognitive architecture, we created a system that integrates a DPLL-like SAT-solving algorithm with a rule matcher in order to support intervals by allowing new constraints and objects to be lazily instantiated throughout inference. Our system also includes constraint graphs to compactly store information about temporal and identity relationships between objects. In addition, a memory retrieval subsystem was utilized to guide inference towards minimal models in common sense reasoning problems involving time and change. We performed two sets of evaluations to isolate the contributions of the system's individual components. These tests demonstrate that both the ability to add new objects during inference and the use of smart memory retrieval result in a significant increase in performance over pure satisfiability algorithms alone and offer solutions to some problems on a larger scale than what was possible before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1951-6851;;978-90-78677-36-9;;;;2010;10;;;;;;1;6;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392160600001;;;;;;

The key theme is that cognition is perception. The description of the main components and mechanisms of the architecture is followed by a discussion of several domains where CHREST has already been successfully applied, such as the psychology of expert behaviour, the acquisition of language by children, and the learning of multiple representations in physics. The characteristics of CHREST that enable it to account for empirical data include: self-organisation, an emphasis on cognitive limitations, the presence of a perception-learning cycle, and the use of naturalistic data as input for learning. We argue that some of these characteristics can help shed light on the hard questions facing theorists developing artificial general intelligence, such as intuition, the acquisition and use of concepts, and the role of embodiment.;;;;;Gobet, Fernand/0000-0002-9317-6886;;;;;;;;;;;;1951-6851;;978-90-78677-36-9;;;;2010;10;;;;;;7;12;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392160600002;;;;;;

Largely inspired by Legg and Hutter's formal definition of universal intelligence, the goal of these definitions is to capture a notion of general intelligence that more closely models that possessed by humans and practical AI systems, which combine an element of universality with a certain degree of specialization to particular environments and goals. Pragmatic general intelligence measures the capability of an agent to achieve goals in environments, relative to prior distributions over goal and environment space. Efficient pragmatic general intelligences measures this same capability, but normalized by the amount of computational resources utilized in the course of the goal-achievement. A methodology is described for estimating these theoretical quantities based on observations of a real biological or artificial system operating in a real environment. Finally, a measure of the degree of generality of an intelligent system is presented, allowing a rigorous distinction between general AI and narrow AI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1951-6851;;978-90-78677-36-9;;;;2010;10;;;;;;19;24;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392160600004;;;;;;

The acquired knowledge is represented in a categorisation-like manner, in which events are categorised into categories of different levels. This inherently facilitates the categorisation of static items and leads to a general approach to both spatial and temporal perception. The paper presents the approach and a demonstration showing how it works.;;;;;Costello, Fintan/0000-0002-3953-7863;;;;;;;;;;;;1951-6851;;978-90-78677-36-9;;;;2010;10;;;;;;109;114;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392160600019;;;;;;

Here we formalize adaptive agents as mixture distributions over sequences of inputs and outputs (I/O). Each distribution of the mixture constitutes a 'possible world', but the agent does not know which of the possible worlds it is actually facing. The problem is to adapt the I/O stream in a way that is compatible with the true world. A natural measure of adaptation can be obtained by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the I/O distribution of the true world and the I/O distribution expected by the agent that is uncertain about possible worlds. In the case of pure input streams, the Bayesian mixture provides a well-known solution for this problem. We show, however, that in the case of I/O streams this solution breaks down, because outputs are issued by the agent itself and require a different probabilistic syntax as provided by intervention calculus. Based on this calculus, we obtain a Bayesian control rule that allows modeling adaptive behavior with mixture distributions over I/O streams. This rule might allow for a novel approach to adaptive control based on a minimum KLprinciple.;;;;Braun, Daniel Alexander/B-7696-2015;Braun, Daniel Alexander/0000-0002-8637-6652;;;;;;;;;;;;1951-6851;;978-90-78677-36-9;;;;2010;10;;;;;;121;126;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392160600021;;;;;;

The most general approach in this line is called Universal Intelligence, which assigns a probability to each possible environment according to several constructs derived from Kolmogorov complexity. In this context, new testing paradigms are being defined in order to devise intelligence tests which are anytime and universal: valid for both artificial intelligent systems and biological systems, of any intelligence degree and of any speed. In this paper, we address one of the pieces in this puzzle: the definition of a general, unbiased, universal class of environments such that they are appropriate for intelligence tests. By appropriate we mean that the environments are discriminative and that they can be feasibly built, in such a way that the environments can be automatically generated and their complexity can be computed.;;;;Hernandez-Orallo, Jose/H-9166-2015;Hernandez-Orallo, Jose/0000-0001-9746-7632;;;;;;;;;;;;1951-6851;;978-90-78677-36-9;;;;2010;10;;;;;;182;183;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392160600033;;;;;;

As most digital sound archives restrict the categorization of audio data to verbal taxonomies, this process of retrieving suitable sounds often becomes a tedious and time-consuming part of their work. The research project AllThatSounds tries to enhance the search procedure by supplying additional, associative and semantic classifications of the audio files. This is achieved by annotating these files with suitable metadata according to a customized systematic categorization scheme. Moreover, additional data is collected by the evaluation of user profiles and by analyzing the sounds with signal processing methods. Using artificial intelligence techniques, similarity distances are calculated between all the audio files in the database, so as to devise a different, highly efficient search algorithm by browsing across similar sounds. The project's result is a tool for structuring sound databases with an efficient search component, which means to guide users to suitable sounds for their sound track of media productions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;978-3-642-12438-9;;;;2010;5954;;;;;;483;491;;;;;;;;;WOS:000279731700025;;;;;;

Some of the theoretical foundations for brain informatics developed in cognitive informatics are elaborated. A key notion recognized in recent studies in cognitive informatics is that the root and profound objective in natural, abstract, and artificial intelligence in general, and in cognitive informatics and brain informatics in particular, is to seek suitable mathematical means for their special needs that were missing in the last six decades. A layered reference model of the brain and a set of cognitive processes of the mind are systematically developed towards the exploration of the theoretical framework of brain informatics. The current methodologies for brain studies are reviewed and their strengths and weaknesses are analyzed.

The dominant study in heuristic search is an empirical way in computer science especially in artificial intelligence. In this paper, we examine the factors that are impact heuristic search from the perspective of human brain. Subjects performed a set of heuristic problems in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) environment. Then a computational cognitive model is set up to simulate processes of information processing of the heuristics problem solving. During the modeling, we found that two main factors, visual attention and goal control, are responsible for speeding up heuristic search in problem solving, where visual attention captures a target selectively with the goal state-directed control. The interaction between these two cognitive systems speeds up the heuristic search, which is superior to machine intelligence. We demonstrate this conclusion by results of modeling, including cost analysis in time, information processing operations, and fitness of fMRI results and model prediction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-15313-6;;;;2010;6334;;;;;;407;416;;;;;;;;;WOS:000312497400038;;;;;;

As such, traditional element-based network management views are being rapidly replaced by integrated management approaches that take the nature of the enterprises and the services they provide into account. More conventional computer applications and established protocols, like Simple Network Management Protocol, provide automation to some extent. But generally speaking, human interactions are crucial for their proper operations. The need for such interactions mainly stems from the incoherency, incompleteness, and conflicting data with varying degrees of relevance available for achieving the management functions. In such complex environments, artificial intelligence-based solutions can be utilized to improve integrated management efficiency. This paper elaborates on these topics. In particular, this work describes several ways that fuzzy representations and knowledge granulations can be used to identify or to improve the solutions to problems encountered in an integrated network management environment. Some specific application areas that demonstrate the effectiveness of these ideas in improving management of the networks are also discussed.;;;;Shahrestani, Seyed/L-3911-2017;Shahrestani, Seyed/0000-0002-8786-9213;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-0-9821489-3-8;;;;2010;;;;;;;1483;1489;;;;;;;;;WOS:000330684100001;;;;;;

The philosophy behind this research is that artificial intelligence at the network node stage can recognize and avert DoS threats on a real time basis. Along this objective a firewall algorithm was designed that examines the header of each and every service requesting packet. Packet requests are classified into accounts by their destination URL, and metadata are being developed based on the volume of packet-requests destined for the same server, as this volume compares to the average such requests. Based on these two parameters - volume over unit of time and average volume over several units of time - an account's activity is deemed insignificant, significant or critical, from the DoS viewpoint threats, and is being identified as level green, yellow or red. At the green level, packets are being propagated as expected. At the yellow level, packets are being propagated along with a flag advising the next network node of the existence of a potential threat. Finally, at the red level packets are being either delayed or possibly blocked and a warning is being sent to surrounding network nodes and to the targeted URL's server. Although at a very small scale, the computer simulation conducted in this research demonstrated that artificial intelligence can be successfully deployed at the network node stage, and that further research refining the designed firewall algorithm is merited.;;;;Chandel, Sonali/AAF-8504-2020;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-0-9821489-3-8;;;;2010;;;;;;;2230;2237;;;;;;;;;WOS:000330684100066;;;;;;

We present a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach to this problem in which MCQs are automatically generated from cases describing events or experiences of interest (e.g., historical events, movie releases, sports events) in a given domain. Measures of interestingness and similarity are used in our approach to guide the retrieval of cases and case features from which questions, distractors, and hints for the user are generated in natural language. We also highlight a potential problem that may occur when similarity is used to select distractors for the correct answer in certain types of MCQ. Finally, we demonstrate and evaluate our approach in an intelligent system for automating the design of MCQ quizzes called AutoMCQ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-14273-4;;;;2010;6176;;;;;;406;420;;;;;;;;;WOS:000289109000030;;;;;;

This paper explores two different behind-the-scenes roles for human operators, during a three-month gallery installation of an embodied character experience. In the Transcription role, human operators type players' spoken utterances; then, algorithms interpret the player's intention, choose from pre-authored dialogue based on local and global narrative contexts, and procedurally animate two embodied characters. In the Discourse role, human operators select from semantic categories to interpret player intention; algorithms use this discourse act to automate character dialogue and animation. We compare these two methods of blending control using game logs and interviews, and document how the amateur operators initially resisted having to learn the Discourse version, but eventually preferred having the authorial control it afforded. This paper also outlines a design space for blending machine and human control in live character experiences.";;;;"MacIntyre, Blair/A-7207-2012; mehta, manish/I-3873-2012";"MacIntyre, Blair/0000-0002-5357-2366; ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-60558-929-9;;;;2010;;;;;;;547;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000281276700061;;;;;;

These semantics can make conflicting predictions, as in the situation known as floating reinstatement. We argue that the debate about which semantics makes the correct prediction can be informed by the collection of experimental data about the way human reasoners handle these critical cases. The data we report show that floating reinstatement yields comparable effects to that of simple reinstatement, thus supporting preferred semantics over grounded semantics. Besides their theoretical value for validating and inspiring argumentation semantics, these results have applied value for developing artificial agents meant to argue with people.;;;;Rahwan, Iyad/ABB-2422-2020;Rahwan, Iyad/0000-0002-1796-4303;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2010;;;;;;;453;458;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392421700076;;;;;;

Problem-solving intuition may be viewed as analogous to search heuristics in artificial intelligence. One prediction inspired by this analogy is that practicing on subproblems and relaxed problems (versions of a problem with fewer constraints on the goal state and on the possible moves, respectively) may enhance the development of intuition for the full problem. Using the n-puzzle, we found that practice on relaxed problems did promote intuition compared to practice on the full problem, but impaired performance on solving the full problem. More detailed analyses suggest that practice on relaxed problems may discourage planning and encourage reliance on intuition. Planning is slower but more likely to produce optimal solutions if given enough time, whereas relying on intuition is faster but may lead to suboptimal solutions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2010;;;;;;;1875;1880;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392421700462;;;;;;

To solve this challenge, it is important to understand general characteristics of the expected learning process at a level of mathematical models. The present work makes a step toward this goal with a simple abstract model of a long-term learning process. Results indicate that this process of learning is characterized by two distinct regimes: (1) limited learning and (2) global learning chain reaction. The transition is determined by the set of initially available learning skills and techniques. Therefore, the notion of a 'critical mass' for a human-level learner makes sense and can be determined experimentally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2010;;;;;;;2308;2313;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392421700535;;;;;;

Our starting point is the remark of John D Sterman [1]: Change is accelerating, and the complexity of the systems in which we live is growing. Increasingly change is the result of humanity itself. As complexity grows so do the unanticipated side effects of human action, further increasing complexity in a vicious cycle. Many scholars call for the development of 'systems thinking' to improve our ability to manage wisely. But how do people learn in and about complex dynamic systems? Learning is a feedback process in which our decisions alter the real world, we receive information feedback about the world, and using the new information we revise the decisions we make and the mental models that motivate those decisions. Our main - both practical and theoretical - question is how do people learn in and about complex dynamic systems? Therefore we investigate the interaction between a human and his/her Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) with the assistance of up-to-date sophisticated Web data mining tools - the SPSS MODELER and the SPSS TEXT ANALYTICS. Since Web mining can be described as an application of data mining under special circumstances, a definition of data mining is required first: Data mining is also called Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). It is commonly defined as the process of discovering useful patterns or knowledge from data sources, e.g. databases, texts, the Web, etc. The patterns must be valid, potentially useful and understandable. Data mining is a multi-disciplinary field involving machine learning, statistics, databases, artificial intelligence, information retrieval, and visualization [2, p. 6]. A similar general definition applies to Web mining:, Web mining aims to discover useful information or knowledge from Web hyperlink structure, page content, and usage data [2, p. 6]. According to this definition, different types of Web mining can be identified as: Web structure mining, Web content mining, and Web usage mining. Our examinations have exclusively dealt with Web usage mining so far. As far as the project's Web mining aspects are concerned, we relied on the notions and procedure systems of the already mentioned excellent book [2]. In this paper Web usage mining is considered as a supportive tool in investigating complex societal systems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1879-8268;;"978-1-60750-653-9; 978-1-60750-652-2";;;;2010;75;;;;;;213;228;;10.3233/978-1-60750-653-9-213;;;;;;;WOS:000350547800017;;;;;;

From the change of 'Artificial Intelligence' to 'Intelligence science', scientists have gradually focused on the core of intelligence. The achievements from both brain science and art support us equally to study and integrate our cognition. Lin's topology cognition theorem inspirits us to integrate it from a global view. The challenge of such integration needs an intensive interdisciplinary study. It requires scientists exceeding the limits from different fields to producing resultant force.

Implementation of this principle in technical systems can lead to more efficient processing procedures. The multistage approach to image processing, described in this paper, comprises both main types of cortical multistage convergence. One of these types occurs within each visual pathway and the other between the pathways. This approach maps input images into a flexible hierarchy which reflects the complexity of the image data. The procedures of temporal image decomposition and hierarchy formation are described in mathematical terms. The multistage system highlights spatial regularities, which are passed through a number of transformational levels to generate a coded representation of the image which encapsulates, in a computer manner, structure on different hierarchical levels in the image. At each processing stage a single output result is computed to allow a very quick response from the system. The result is represented as an activity pattern, which can be compared with previously computed patterns on the basis of the closest match.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-981-4324-43-4;;;;2010;3;;;;;;665;676;;10.1142/9789814324441_0078;;;;;;;WOS:000290974100078;;;;;;

Actually the possibility for using advanced ICT, new generations of web products and services but mainly for utilization of Cl are giant jump ahead in deeper understanding complex economic phenomena without historical precedence. In this chapter the author is focusing his attention to new evolving Scientific Program (SP) in General Economics (GE) area called Computational Qualitative Economics (CQE). He shows that CI effectively helps for deeper understanding also conventional complex economic problems even with rather simple CI devices. The great advantage of Cl products and services laying in option for assistance not only in knowledge acquisition and in theory building process but can assist in writing of codified theories and in performance of different digital happenings and in compositions and programming of digital scene for authentic performance of evolutionary stories. Among others this chapter will explore the potential advantages and disadvantages of Computational Qualitative Economics (CQE) so for the analysis of real economies, economic systems, models and artificial entities as for the study of codified conventional economic theories and/or economic theories of main stream. The author is also hints at recent debates about the potential methodological costs and benefits of ICT, Internet and CI use in qualitative research, modelling, simulation, and about the relationship between methodological approaches on the one hand and CI assistance methods of qualitative research on the other. It is not consent to argument that the connection between certain ICT, Internet and CI aided strategies and methodological approaches are far looser than is often assumed. He not means that they can panacea potentials but the gains from using them are significant in wide area of socio-economic research. The Qualitative theory building, writing, endosomatic rebuilding and using by authentic subjects assisted by ICT, Internet and Cl contribute significant progress in cogitation and so in deeper understanding of economies living in global knowledge based society.

This formalism takes into account the relative strength of arguments with respect to some ordering which represents an audience. Deciding subjective or objective acceptance (i.e., acceptance with respect to at least one or with respect to all orderings) are intractable computational problems. In this paper we study the computational complexity of testing the subjective or objective acceptance for problem instances that obey certain restrictions. We consider structural restrictions in terms of the underlying graph structure of the value-based argumentation framework and in terms of properties of the equivalence relation formed by arguments with the same relative strength. We identify new tractable fragments where subjective and objective acceptance can be tested in polynomial time. Furthermore we show the intractability of some fragments that are located at the boundary to tractability.

This paper aims to investigate and develop intelligent systems for learning the concept of female facial beauty and producing human-like predictors. Artists and social scientists have long been fascinated by the notion of facial beauty; but study by computer scientists has only begun in the last few years. Our work is notably different from and goes beyond previous works in several aspects: 1) we focus on fully-automatic learning approaches that do not require costly manual annotation of landmark facial features but simply take the raw pixels as inputs; 2) our study is based on a collection of data that is an order of magnitude larger than that of any previous study; 3) we imposed no restrictions in terms of pose, lighting, background; expression; age, and ethnicity on the face images used for training and testing. These factors significantly increased the difficulty of the learning task. We show that a biologically-inspired model with multiple layers of trainable feature extractors can produce results that are much more human-like than the previously used eigenface approach. Finally; we develop a novel visualization method to interpret the learned model and revealed the existence of several beautiful features that go beyond the current averageness and symmetry hypotheses.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-15566-6;;;;2010;6316;;;;;;434;447;;;;;;;;;WOS:000286578700032;;;;;;

Peirce, is one of the forms of inference. Abduction has been researched not only in philosophy but also in artificial intelligence and information science. Finlay and Dix's representation of abduction (1996) has almost the same meaning which is given by Peirce. On the other hand, Sawa and Gunji (2010) express three types of inference as operations of arrows on a simple triangular diagram. In the present paper, we show that Sawa-Gunji's representation of abduction is consistent with Finlay-Dix's one, and synthesize the two representations. Both parameter estimation and abduction occupy a similar position on the synthesized representation, but they are not completely corresponding. We present incomplete parameter estimation as a sort of simulated abduction, since abduction has an intrinsic incompleteness, which means that abduction is formally equivalent to the logical fallacy affirming the consequent. In other words, a numerical aspect of abduction (i.e. the simulated abduction) is formalized as incomplete parameter estimation. The concept of simulated abduction is applied to parameter estimation of auto-regressive models, and the effects of it is investigated. As a result of the numerical analyses, the distribution of the incompletely estimated parameter shows a power law of the slop 2 in the tail, although conventionally estimated parameter is normally distributed. The power law of the incompletely estimated parameter is based on the structure of ratio distribution. In other words, this result shows that the power law can arise when system observers premise a linearity of input and output data which are too small to estimate the system structure. We call the premise of the system observers linearity bias. As an example of the cause of power law distributions, self-organized criticality (SOC) has been known. These distributions are based on the mechanisms of the systems themselves, which have some organized interaction between their elements. On the other hand, power law distribution which is derived from the incomplete parameter estimation and the linearity bias is not based on a mechanism of system itself but on relationship between data on the system and observer of the data. Consequently, our research suggests that complexity expressed by a power law distribution can be derived from the incomplete parameter estimation which is a numerical aspect of abduction and is different from SOC mechanisms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0094-243X;;978-0-7354-0858-6;;;;2010;1303;;;;;;60;67;;;;;;;;;WOS:000287168400006;;;;;;

Despite the advances on the field of anticipation there are little thoughts on relation with the reactive behavior, the similarities and where the boundary is. In this article we will present our viewpoint and we will try to show that reactive and anticipatory behavior can be combined. This is the basic ground of our unified theory for anticipatory behavior architecture. We still miss such compact theory, which would integrate multiple aspects of anticipation. My multi-level anticipatory behavior approach is based on the current understanding of anticipation from both the artificial intelligence and biology point of view. As part of the explanation we will also elaborate on the topic of weak and strong artificial life. Anticipation is not matter of a single mechanism in a living organism. It was noted already that it happens on many different levels even in the very simple creatures. What we consider to be important for our work and what is our original though is that it happens even without voluntary control. We believe that this is novelty though for the anticipation theory. Naturally research of anticipation was in the beginning of this decade focused on the anticipatory principles bringing advances on the field itself. This allowed us to build on those, look at them from higher perspective, and use not one but multiple levels of anticipation in a creature design. This presents second original though and that is composition of the agent architecture that has anticipation built in almost every function. In this article we will focus only on first two levels within the 8-factor anticipation framework. We will introduce them as defined categories of anticipation and describe them from theory and implementation algorithm point of view. We will also present an experiment conducted, however this experiment serves more as explanatory example. These first two levels may seem trivial, but growing interest in implicit anticipation and reactive anticipation in last two years suggest that this is worthwhile topic. The simplicity of them is intentional to demonstrate our way of thinking and understanding of the topic. The comparison with other results is possible only when these levels are integrated into the complex architecture, as will be shown below that can also act as standalone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0094-243X;;978-0-7354-0858-6;;;;2010;1303;;;;;;84;92;;;;;;;;;WOS:000287168400009;;;;;;

But what are the consequences of this idea for humans knowledge, their theories of nature and their mathematics? We discuss the view that even Plato's objective world of mathematical objects does not exist absolutely, without the intentions of mathematicians. Using Husserl's Phenomenological Method, cognition can be understood as a process by which meaning is deduced from empirical data relative to intentions. Thereby the essential structure of any cognition process can be detected and this structure is mirrored in logic. A natural logic becomes the direct result of cognition. Only in a second step, mathematics is obtained by abstraction from natural logic. In this way mathematics gains a well-defined foundation and is no longer part of a dubious 'a-priori knowledge' (Kant). This access to mathematics offers a new look on many old problems, e.g. the Petersburg problem and the problem 'P=NP?'. We demonstrate that this new justification of mathematics has also important applications in Artificial Intelligence. Our method provides a procedure to construct an adequate logic to solve most efficiently the problems of a given problem class. Thus, heuristics can be tailor-made for the necessities of applications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0094-243X;;978-0-7354-0858-6;;;;2010;1303;;;;;;189;198;;;;;;;;;WOS:000287168400021;;;;;;

In this paper we present a simplified version of the fuzzy decision method and its comparison with the paraconsistent one. Paraconsistent annotated evidential logic Et, introduced by Da Costa, Vago and Subrahmanian (1991), is capable of handling uncertain and contradictory data without becoming trivial. It has been used in many applications such as information technology, robotics, artificial intelligence, production engineering, decision making etc. Intuitively, one Et logic formula is type p((a, b)), in which a and b belong to [0, 1] (real interval) and represent respectively the degree of favorable evidence (or degree of belief) and the degree of contrary evidence (or degree of disbelief) found in p. The set of all pairs (a; b), called annotations, when plotted, form the Cartesian Unitary Square (CUS). This set, containing a similar order relation of real number, comprises a network, called lattice of the annotations. Fuzzy logic was introduced by Zadeh (1965). It tries to systematize the knowledge study, searching mainly to study the fuzzy knowledge (you don't know what it means) and distinguish it from the imprecise one (you know what it means, but you don't know its exact value). This logic is similar to paraconsistent annotated one, since it attributes a numeric value (only one, not two values) to each proposition (then we can say that it is an one-valued logic). This number translates the intensity (the degree) with which the preposition is true. Let's X a set and A, a subset of X, identified by the function f(x). For each element x is an element of X, you have y = f(x) is an element of [0, 1] The number y is called degree of pertinence of x in A. Decision making theories based on these logics have shown to be powerful in many aspects regarding more traditional methods, like the one based on Statistics. In this paper we present a first study for a simplified version of decision making theory based on Fuzzy Logic (SVMFD) and a comparison with the Paraconsistent Decision Method (PDM) based on Paraconsistent Annotated Evidential Logic E tau, already presented and summarized in this paper. An example showing the two methods is presented in the paper, as well as a comparison between them.";;;;Abe, Jair Minoro/C-6997-2013;Abe, Jair Minoro/0000-0003-2088-9065;;;;;;;;;;;;0094-243X;;978-0-7354-0858-6;;;;2010;1303;;;;;;216;235;;;;;;;;;WOS:000287168400024;;;;;;

This paper defends the idea that the neural ectoderm is the actual brain, based on the development of the human embryo. Indeed, the neural ectoderm includes the neural crest, given by pigment cells in the skin and ganglia of the autonomic nervous system, and the neural tube, given by the brain, the spinal cord, and motor neurons. So the brain is completely integrated in the ectoderm, and cannot work alone. The paper presents fundamental properties of the brain as follows. Firstly, Paul D. MacLean proposed the triune human brain, which consists to three brains in one, following the species evolution, given by the reptilian complex, the limbic system, and the neo-cortex. Secondly, the consciousness and conscious awareness are analysed. Thirdly, the anticipatory unconscious free will and conscious free veto are described in agreement with the experiments of Benjamin Libet. Fourthly, the main section explains the development of the human embryo and shows that the neural ectoderm is the whole neural brain. Fifthly, a conjecture is proposed that the neural brain is completely programmed with scripts written in biological low-level and high-level languages, in a manner similar to the programmed cells by the genetic code. Finally, it is concluded that the proposition of the neural ectoderm as the whole neural brain is a breakthrough in the understanding of the natural intelligence, and also in the future design of robots with artificial intelligence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0094-243X;;978-0-7354-0858-6;;;;2010;1303;;;;;;236;245;;;;;;;;;WOS:000287168400025;;;;;;

This, in turn, has prompted various attempts to analyze the phenomenon and explain the threat to the wider public. Unfortunately, however, the reports and analysis are often confusing and can include rather arbitrary use of various cyber buzz words. It follows that there is a need for a formal rigorous model for describing and analyzing cyber conflicts. Formal methods are also necessary for developing artificial intelligence-enabled offensive and defensive systems for cyber conflicts. In order to provide a remedy for this issue, we propose a formalized framework of key terms in cyber conflict. We begin by revisiting the concepts of knowledge, data and information. Based on that we proceed to define information system and intelligent system. We provide a formal description for the concept of destroying and falsifying information and explain the concepts of confidentiality, integrity and availability as part of our framework. We then propose definitions for cyber weapons, cyber incidents, cyber attacks, cyber espionage, cyber conflicts and finally, cyberwar. The framework is based on formal logic and allows for theoretical, experimental or empirical research with mathematically provable results. As such, it can provide a solid backbone for cyber conflict research, which is often based on less rigorous methods.;;;;Ottis, Rain/A-7754-2019;Ottis, Rain/0000-0002-1362-1733;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-9949-9040-1-3;;;;2010;;;;;;;129;142;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392673700007;;;;;;

Broadband computer networks as IEEE 802.11 are seriously competing with cellular network technologies such as UMTS and HSDPA. Unfortunately, this increased mobility comes with privacy and security related issues. We are currently in the process of identifying possible attacks on the privacy of wireless network users, since the development of effective countermeasures is only possible with a thorough understanding of such attacks. One serious threat we are discussing here, is the tracking of users in metropolitan networks by means of determining their physical location. Any individual user can be identified either by the devices she is using or by the behavior she is displaying. Suitable features range from single identifiers such as IP or MAC addresses to complex conglomerates of different values that provide valuable information due to their combination. This article focuses on the extraction and analysis of features that are valuable for fingerprinting by employing Activation Patterns, a concept based on artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. The concept is applied to email header data, since this allows for an effective illustration of the employed techniques. Furthermore, due to the human understandable data, we can easily evaluate the effectiveness of the concept before we start to analyze more complex data-sets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-17618-0;;;;2010;6467;;;;;;76;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000286412700007;;;;;;

In spite of extensive research, no generic system has been proposed. The previous work mainly assumes that textile has a 2D planar structure. They also require time-consuming objective measurement of textile properties in mechanical/physical model construction. A novel approach for haptic modeling of textile is proposed to overcome the existing shortcomings. The method is generic, assumes a 3D structure textile artifact, and deploys computational intelligence to estimate textile mechanical and physical properties. The approach is designed primarily for display of textile artifacts in museums. The haptic model is constructed by superimposing the mechanical model of textile over its 3D geometrical model. Digital image processing is applied to the still image of textile to identify its pattern and structure. In order to deal with the non-linearities associated with the textile, a fuzzy rule-based expert system is deployed. This information is then used to generate a 3D geometric model of the artifact in VRML. Selected mechanical and physical properties of the textile are estimated by an artificial neural network with the textile geometric characteristics and yarn properties as inputs. The neural network learning and verification and validation processes are carried out by a sample data set. The mechanical properties are used in the construction of the textile mechanical model. The haptic rendered model is generated by superimposing the physical/mechanical model over the 3D geometric model. This model has been implemented and rendered in Reachin environment, provided an interactive Virtual Reality environment where the user can navigate the graphic 3D presentation of the textile and touch it by a haptic device. Different samples have been modeled and the whole approach has been validated. The interface can be provided in both in the physical environment and through the cyberspace. The validation of method indicates the feasibility of the approach and its superiority to other haptic modeling algorithms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1868-4238;;978-3-642-15213-9;;;;2010;333;;;;;;87;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000303172900009;;;;;;

Granular Computing and Fuzzy Logic have been designed for physical and IT engineering applications to automate complex tasks. Fuzzy Logic is not only useful as an analytical concept, but also, can be generally applied to the production of music itself through a Fuzzy Logic control system. As artificial intelligence design and computing power both improve, it may well become possible to perform this work by digital means.

It is intended to help people who may not be cultural specialists to quickly develop the cultural skills they need to be effective in intercultural settings. This includes the knowledge and skills necessary to handle common situations involving intercultural interactions, as well as the adaptability needed to cope with unexpected intercultural interactions. Crucially, it utilizes simulations of intercultural encounters that learners are likely to experience in the course of carrying out their jobs or missions, which help learners develop the skills and confidence necessary to be effective in those situations. The approach also supports the assessment of cultural competence by testing trainees in simulated intercultural encounters. The approach makes use of a number of innovative technologies, but most importantly immersive game and artificial intelligence technologies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;978-3-642-17183-3;;;;2010;6259;;;;;;1;15;;;;;;;;;WOS:000286092800001;;;;;;

In Model-based Diagnosis, both Artificial Intelligence and Control Theory communities have provided different but complementary approaches. Recent works, known as BRIDGE proposal, provided a common framework for the integration of techniques for static systems. This work proposes the extension of the BRIDGE framework for a specific class of dynamic systems, thus analyzing the influence of dynamic constraints in the behavior estimation capabilities for two Model-based Diagnosis techniques: Possible Conflicts and Analytical Redundancy Relations obtained through structural analysis. Results show the strong similarities between them, and provide new ways for integration of techniques from both areas. Additionally, algorithms computing Possible Conflicts provide the implicit structural model for state observer design with no extra knowledge added in the model.

Many definitions and formalisms for the notion of spatio-temporal reasoning have emerged in various research fields including psychology, economics and computer science (computational linguistics, data management, control theory, artificial intelligence and others). In this paper we examine the role of spatio-temporal reasoning in situation management, particularly how to resolve situations that are described by using spatio-temporal relations among events and situations.

They have wide area of usage ranging from artificial intelligence, natural language processing to web content and biology. This paper proposes the problem of finding similar objects that have been defined as a set of terms from an ontology. We consider tree-based ontologies where a node represents a term and an edge weight defines the distance or dissimilarity between corresponding terms. For object distance, Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is used as it outperforms other distance measures like average and minimum pair-wise distance. EMD, however is highly computationally intensive as it involves solution to linear programming (LP) problem. We propose an efficient lower bound on computing EMD by aggregating the terms in the ontology at the first level of the tree. This reduces the number of terms, thereby decreasing the number of flow variables and making it computationally faster. Range queries that use the lower bound runs faster by up to a factor of 20, as approximately 97% percentage of database objects are pruned, thereby saving expensive EMD calculations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;978-3-642-15250-4;;;;2010;6262;;;;;;360;374;;;;;;;;;WOS:000285525100029;;;;;;

Several methods have already been proposed in this field, especially in geometry theorem proving. Since they belong to algebraic elimination method or artificial intelligence method, it is difficult to use them to express domain knowledge clearly or represent hierarchy of systems. Therefore, we build a loosely coupled system to combine ontology and rule-based reasoning. Firstly, we construct elementary geometry ontology with OWL DL by creating classes, properties and constraints for searching or reasoning in domains. Then we design bidirectional reasoning based on rules and reasoning strategies such as all-connection method, numerical test method, rule classification methods and so on for complex reasoning. The system greatly improves sharing and reusability of domain knowledge and simultaneously implements readable proofs for geometry theorem proving efficiently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1865-0929;;978-3-642-17621-0;;;;2010;118;;;;;;110;119;;;;;;;;;WOS:000288690600012;;;;;;

Specifically, we have tackled a real-world version of the FAP -Frequency Assignment Problem by using three very relevant and efficient metaheuristics. Realistic versions of the FAP are NP-hard problems because the number of available frequencies to cover the entire network communications is always much reduced. On the other hand, it is well known that heuristic algorithms are very appropriate methods when tackling this sort of complex optimization problems. Therefore, we have chosen three different strategies to compare their results. These methods are: a very novel metaheuristic based on swarm intelligence (ABC -Artificial Bee Colony) which has not ever been used previously to tackle the FAP; a very efficient Genetic Algorithm (GA) which is a classical and effective algorithm tackling optimization problems; and one of the approaches that provides better results solving our problem: Scatter Search (SS).

In this paper, we introduce and study Metric Propositional Neighborhood Logic (MPNL) over natural numbers. MPNL features two modalities referring, respectively, to an interval that is met by the current one and to an interval that meets the current one, plus an infinite set of length constraints, regarded as atomic propositions, to constrain the lengths of intervals. We argue that MPNL can be successfully used in different areas of artificial intelligence to combine qualitative and quantitative interval temporal reasoning, thus providing a viable alternative to well-established logical frameworks such as Duration Calculus. We show that MPNL is decidable in double exponential time and expressively complete with respect to a well-defined sub-fragment of the two-variable fragment FO2[N,=,<, s] of first-order logic for linear orders with successor function, interpreted over natural numbers. Moreover, we show that MPNL can be extended in a natural way to cover full FO2[N,=,<, s], but, unexpectedly, the latter (and hence the former) turns out to be undecidable.;;;;Monica, Dario Della/AAC-6091-2020;"Sciavicco, Guido/0000-0002-9221-879X; BRESOLIN, DAVIDE/0000-0003-2253-9878; Della Monica, Dario/0000-0001-9743-665X";;;;;;;;;;;;0922-6389;1879-8314;"978-1-60750-605-8; 978-1-60750-606-5";;;;2010;215;;;;;;695;700;;10.3233/978-1-60750-606-5-695;;;;;;;WOS:000306373200108;;;;;;

The goal of an abduction problem is to find a solution, i.e., an explanation for some observed symptoms. Usually, many solutions exist, and one is often interested in minimal ones only. Previous definitions of solutions to an abduction problem tacitly made an open-world assumption. However, as far as minimality is concerned, this assumption may not always lead to the desired behavior. To overcome this problem, we propose a new definition of solutions based on a closed-world approach. Moreover, we also introduce a new variant of minimality where only a part of the hypotheses is subject to minimization. A thorough complexity analysis reveals the close relationship between these two new notions as well as the differences compared with previous notions of solutions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0922-6389;;978-1-60750-605-8;;;;2010;215;;;;;;895;900;;10.3233/978-1-60750-606-5-895;;;;;;;WOS:000306373200139;;;;;;

In this paper we do not focus either on educational games nor in other computer games (e. g. arcade) use to educate in an indirect way. On the contrary, computer games are a vehicle to illustrate the contents explained in the classroom and to motivate the students to work hard in their programming assignments. To do this we describe our experience in two compulsory subjects (Artificial Intelligence -AI-and Knowledge Engineering) taught respectively in the first and second term of the 4th year at the Computer Science Engineering degree at the University of Castilla-La Mancha (Albacete, Spain). We would like to emphasize that the goal of these two courses is not to teach computer (video) games programming, but to develop software agents to play games whose behaviour is based on the use of AI algorithms/techniques. Like that we tried to escape from the boredom of implementing small-programs based mainly in graph theory concepts to illustrate the in-class learned algorithms and to benefit from using the same problem so that the overhead of dealing and understanding several and distinct problems is avoided. In this paper we describe the use of two different platforms/games (PacMan and RoboCode) as the framework for laboratory assignment in the two courses aforementioned.

However, the training offered in computer science studies lacks that multidisciplinary, focusing more on purely technical aspects. The campus, a place where studies of very different nature exist side by side, may constitute an excellent basis for conducting multidisciplinary training without underestimating higher education rigor. The aim of the universities is to train their students in the skills demanded by businesses and companies. According to experts, students need to develop more the skills called generic in which can be found the interpersonal skills. This paper presents a good example where computer studies and educational psychology find out a common ground and realistic working through laboratory practices. Specifically, the work enables to students of computer science education the development of diagnosis support systems, with artificial intelligence techniques, that could then be used for future educational psychologists. The applications developed by computer science students is the creation of a model for the diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), sometimes also commonly called the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The complexity of this diagnosis, not only by the exclusive characteristics of every person who suffer it but also by the large numbers of variables involved in it, requires a very strong and closed interdisciplinary participation. Moreover, for the enhancement of this software (and especially for the collection and creation of the database) it has been required the creation of a working framework which involves doctors and families, as well as those students of computer science and educational psychology already mentioned. The final purpose of this tool for the diagnosis is its applicability in primary schools to increase the early detection and diagnosis. Meanwhile, students of educational psychology incorporate their knowledge to adjust the computer application successfully, incorporating it the qualitative and quantitative information needed for verification. As a result of this synergy, a good interdisciplinary teamwork has emerged, closer to the real world than the university and which all would be enriched. In this sense, this work demonstrates that it is possible to intervene in a curricular perspective, in the university, to promote the development of interpersonal skills. It can be shown, in this way, a methodology for interdisciplinary practices design and a guide for monitoring and evaluation.";;;;"Pertegal-Felices, Maria Luisa/H-5049-2015; Jimeno-Morenilla, Antonio/K-5544-2014";"Pertegal-Felices, Maria Luisa/0000-0002-3716-4485; Jimeno-Morenilla, Antonio/0000-0002-3789-6475";;;;;;;;;;;;2340-1117;;978-84-613-9386-2;;;;2010;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000318781705037;;;;;;

In a soccer robot game, the environment is highly competitive and dynamic. In order to work in the dynamically changing environment, the decision making system of a soccer robot system should have the features of flexibility and real-time adaptation. In this paper we will focus on the Middle Size Soccer Robot league (MSL) and new hierarchical hybrid fuzzy methods for decision making and action selection of a robot in Middle Size Soccer Robot league (MSL) are presented. First, the behaviors of an agent are introduced, implemented and classified in two layers, the Low_Level_Behaviors and the High_Level_Behaviors. In the second layer, a two phase mechanism for decision making is introduced. In phase one, some useful methods are implemented which check the robot's situation for performing required behaviors. In the next phase, the team strategy, team formation, robot's role and the robot's positioning system are introduced. A fuzzy logical approach is employed to recognize the team strategy and further more to tell the player the best position to move. We believe that a Dynamic role engine is necessary for a successful team. Dynamic role engine and formation control during offensive or defensive play, help us to prevent collision avoidance among own players when attacking the ball and obstacle avoidance of the opponents. At last, we comprised our implemented algorithm in the Robocup 2007 and 2008 and results showed the efficiency of the introduced methodology. The results are satisfactory which has already been successfully implemented in ADRO RoboCup team. This project is still in progress and some new interesting methods are described in the current report.;;;;Kasaei, Shohreh/AAD-5618-2019;Kasaei, Shohreh/0000-0002-3831-0878;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-981-4327-97-8;;;;2010;;;;;;;47;55;;;;;;;;;WOS:000394404600008;;;;;;

Robust optimal control of flexible structures with active feedback techniques requires good models of the base structure, and knowledge of the uncertainties of these models. Such information may not be easy to acquire for certain systems. It has been known that fuzzy-logic-based modelling and control could serve as a powerful methodology for dealing with imprecision and nonlinearity efficiently. On the other hand, classical control laws are designed for linear systems and they provide a preferable cost/benefit ratio. However, the presence of nonlinear effects limits their performances. Hybridization of fuzzy logic techniques and classical PDD control schemes will exploit the beneficial features of both categories. This paper addresses the problem of input tracking control of a nonlinear flexible system namely a twin rotor multi-input multi-output (MEMO) system (TRMS) in hovering mode using hybrid control approaches in simulation and real time situations. An ANFIS model of the TRMS is used to represent its behaviour in the simulation environment. The obtained results in real-time prove the efficiency of the proposed scheme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-981-4327-97-8;;;;2010;;;;;;;332;339;;;;;;;;;WOS:000394404600042;;;;;;

Henry's interpretation of Marxian philosophy in the frame of his phenomenology of life. Its aim is to show the relevance of Henry's interpretation for the global crisis of capitalism in our times. Henry argues that economic questions in Marx's Capital, first of all his theory of surplus value, is closely connected with the historical issues in his German ideology. Attention is also paid to Marx's thesis about the science becoming a direct production force. In the era of automatization, when most of common work is reliably done by the highly developed technological devices, such as artificial intelligence, Marx's idea of a free development of every individual as a condition of a free development of all is not a utopian one any more. It becomes a normative claim concerning economic and political reality. Thus Marx's idea of a classless society could be interpreted as a system of global justice, in which the extreme global inequality has been overcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0046-385X;;;;;;2010;65;9;;;;;833;844;;;;;;;;;WOS:000286023400002;;;;;;

(1) Classical action systems are used to model the discrete controller behavior. (2) Qualitative differential equations are used to model the evolutions of the environment. The latter is based on a technique from the domain of Artificial Intelligence called qualitative reasoning. Mutation testing on these models is used to generate effective test cases. A test case generator has been developed that searches for all test cases that would kill a mutant. The mutant models represent our fault models. The generated test cases are then executed on the implementation in order to systematically exclude the possibility that a mutant has been implemented.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;978-3-642-17070-6;;;;2010;6286;;;;;;228;249;;;;;;;;;WOS:000291324200012;;;;;;

Based on color and texture analysis, we identify the main barriers to wound healing, such as tissue nonviable, infection, inflammation, moisture imbalance, or edge non-advancing. This framework provides the infrastructure for preparing e-learning scenarios based on practice and real world experiences. We make experiments for wound healing simulation using various treatments and compare the results with experimental observations. Our experiments are supported by XML based databases containing knowledge extracted from previous wound healing experiences and from medical experts' knowledge. Also, we rely on new paradigms of the Artificial Intelligence for creating e-learning scenarios to be used in a context of active learning, for wound image understanding. To implement the e-learning tools, we use Java technologies for dynamic processes and XML technologies for dynamic content.

The BCM architecture not only can be applied to many important algorithms in artificial intelligence, signal processing; and digital communications, but also has high reusability, i.e., a new application needs not change a BCM's hardware design, only new task graph processing and code compilation are necessary. Moreover, the throughput of a BCM scales almost linearly with the size of the FPGA on which it is implemented. A Bayesian computing machine with 16 processing nodes was implemented with a Virtex-5 FPGA (XCV5LX155T-2) on a BEE3 (Berkeley Emulation Engine) platform. For a wide variety of sample Bayesian problems, comparing running the same network evaluation algorithm on a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo Intel processor and a GeForce 9400m using the CUDA software package, the BCM demonstrates 80x and 15x speedups respectively, with a peak throughput of 20.4 GFLOPS (Giga Floating-Point Operations per Second).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-60558-911-4;;;;2010;;;;;;;73;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000285022000010;;;;;;

Research at the crossroads of neuroscience and artificial intelligence in the last decade has helped understanding how the brain organizes reinforcement learning (RL) processes (the adaptation of decisions based on feedback from the environment). The current challenge is now to understand how the brain flexibly regulates parameters of RL such as the exploration rate based on the task structure, which is called meta-learning ([1]: Doya, 2002). Here, we propose a computational mechanism of exploration regulation based on real neurophysiological and behavioral data recorded in monkey prefrontal cortex during a visuo-motor task involving a clear distinction between exploratory and exploitative actions. We first fit trial-by-trial choices made by the monkeys with an analytical reinforcement learning model. We find that the model which has the highest likelihood of predicting monkeys' choices reveals different exploration rates at different task phases. In addition, the optimized model has a very high learning rate, and a reset of action values associated to a cue used in the task to signal condition changes. Beyond classical RL mechanisms, these results suggest that the monkey brain extracted task regularities to tune learning parameters in a task-appropriate way. We finally use these principles to develop a neural network model extending a previous cortico-striatal loop model. In our prefrontal cortex component, prediction error signals are extracted to produce feedback categorization signals. The latter are used to boost exploration after errors, and to attenuate it during exploitation, ensuring a lock on the currently rewarded choice. This model performs the task like monkeys, and provides a set of experimental predictions to be tested by future neurophysiological recordings.;;;;"Dominey, Peter/H-3832-2012; procyk, emmanuel/H-3037-2014; Khamassi, Mehdi/B-2425-2012";"Dominey, Peter/0000-0002-9318-179X; procyk, emmanuel/0000-0001-7486-4993; Khamassi, Mehdi/0000-0002-2515-1046";;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-15192-7;;;;2010;6226;;;;;;424;434;;;;;;;;;WOS:000286843200040;;;;;;

Because of the big span of main spindle and its high speed when it is working, the breakdown sometimes occurs. It is very importance to monitor its condition and diagnose its breakdowns. Turbulent Flow Displacement Sensors are the non-contact types which are based on eddy current effect. It has many advantages, such as good linearity, wide frequency response scope, convenience installment and so on. So it is very suitable for the main spindle's vibration signals of a high speed brushes aeration mechanic are monitored. With the development of Artificial Neural Networks technology, the equipment breakdown diagnosis has realized intellectualization. The recognition of equipment failure types is one of the most important studying domains of Artificial Neural Networks at present. Based on the research of eddy current effect and Artificial Neural Networks, we build up a test system which can monitor condition and diagnose breakdown to a GSB-12 high speed brushes aeration mechanic. With the help of it, the vibration signals of the measurement points on the main spindle are measured at two mutually vertical positions. The signals' base frequency and multiplicative frequency are taken as characteristic value. Six common breakdowns are selected and to be taken as the standard sample and there are 3 lays in the neural network. Using FBP algorithm, we get a satisfied effect. The experiment has confirmed that this method is advanced, reliable and practical. It provides a new method about intelligent monitor and breakdown diagnosis to high speed brushes aeration mechanics' condition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1013-9826;;;;;;2010;426-427;;;;;;191;+;;10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.426-427.191;;;;;;;WOS:000279355900042;;;;;;

The strength of feed forward artificial neural networks is used to mathematically model the equations and particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied for learning of weights, aided by simulating annealing algorithm for rapid local search. The design scheme has been successfully applied to solve different types of linear ordinary differential equations of fractional order. The results were compared with exact solutions, analytic solution and standard numerical techniques. In case of simple linear ordinary fractional differential equations, relatively more precise solutions were obtained than standard numerical methods. However, for complex linear fractional differential equation, the same scheme is applicable, but with reduced accuracy. The advantage of this approach is that the solution is available on the domain of continuous inputs unlike the other numerical techniques.;;;;"Khan, Junaid Ali/ABG-2756-2020; Raja, Muhammad Asif Zahoor/D-7325-2013";"Khan, Junaid Ali/0000-0003-2630-1744; Raja, Muhammad Asif Zahoor/0000-0001-9953-822X; J, Raja/0000-0003-1481-0605";;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4503-0073-5;;;;2010;;;;;;;2023;2026;;;;;;;;;WOS:000322071400079;;;;;;

A central goal of human genetics is to identify which DNA sequence variations predict disease risk in human populations. Our success in this endeavour will depend critically on the development and implementation of computational intelligence methods that are able to embrace, rather than ignore, the complexity of the genotype to phenotype relationship. To this end, we have developed a computational evolution system (CES) to discover genetic models of disease susceptibility involving complex relationships between DNA sequence variations. The CES approach is hierarchically organized and is capable of evolving operators of any arbitrary complexity. The ability to evolve operators distinguishes this approach from artificial evolution approaches using fixed operators such as mutation and recombination. Our previous studies have shown that a CES that can utilize expert knowledge about the problem in evolved operators significantly outperforms a CES unable to use this knowledge. This environmental sensing of external sources of biological or statistical knowledge is important when the search space is both rugged and large as in the genetic analysis of complex diseases. We show here that the CES is also capable of evolving operators which exploit one of several sources of expert knowledge to solve the problem. This is important for both the discovery of highly fit genetic models and because the particular source of expert knowledge used by evolved operators may provide additional information about the problem itself. This study brings us a step closer to a CES that can solve complex problems in human genetics in addition to discovering genetic models of disease.;;;;Greene, Casey/L-2057-2015;Greene, Casey/0000-0001-8713-9213;;;;;;;;;;;;1932-0167;;978-1-4419-1625-9;;;;2010;;;;;;;19;36;;10.1007/978-1-4419-1626-6_2;;;;;;;WOS:000273389200002;;;;;;

Thus, the aim of this research was to develop a methodology in order to automate the sugarcane mapping task when remote sensing data are used. Thus the integration of two major approaches of Artificial Intelligence, Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Data Mining (DM), were tested in a study area located in Sao Paulo state, which is well representative of the agriculture of large regions of Brazil and other countries. OBIA was used to emulate the interpreter knowledge in the process of sugarcane mapping, and DM techniques were employed for automatic generation of knowledge model. A time series of four Landsat images was acquired in order to represent the wide variability of the patterns during sugarcane crop season. Definiens Developer (R) multiresolution segmentation algorithm produced the objects and properly trained decision tree applied to the Landsat data for the generation of the thematic map with sugarcane as the main class of interest. An overall accuracy of 94% (Kappa = 0,87) was obtained, showing that OBIA and DM are very efficient and promising in the direction of automating the sugarcane classification process with Landsat multitemporal time series.;;;;Renno, Camilo Daleles/B-9070-2014;Renno, Camilo Daleles/0000-0001-9920-4473;;;;;;;;;;;;2194-9034;;;;;;2010;38-4-C7;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000358414100026;;;;;;

On the other hand preliminary application of Genetic Algorithms (GA) has already been reported in the literature by the authors regarding the peak detection problem encountered in MRS quantification using the Voigt line shape model. This paper investigates a novel constrained genetic algorithm involving a generic and adaptively defined fitness function which extends the simple genetic algorithm methodology in case of noisy signals. The applicability of this new algorithm is scrutinized through experimentation in artificial MRS signals interleaved with noise, regarding its signal fitting capabilities. Although extensive experiments with real world MRS signals are necessary, the herein shown performance illustrates the method's potential to be established as a generic MRS metabolites quantification procedure.;;;;"Karras, Dimitrios Alexios/AAD-7229-2019; Papakostas, George/F-1038-2017";"Karras, Dimitrios Alexios/0000-0002-2759-8482; Papakostas, George/0000-0001-5545-1499";;;;;;;;;;;;1865-0929;1865-0937;978-3-642-17624-1;;;;2010;121;;;;;;257;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000288627100026;;;;;;

This test is limited to the linguistic aspects of machine intelligence. A salient function of the brain is the control of movement, with the human hand movement being a sophisticated demonstration of this function. Therefore, we propose a Turing-like handshake test, for machine motor intelligence. We administer the test through a telerobotic system in which the interrogator is engaged in a task of holding a robotic stylus and interacting with another party (human, artificial, or a linear combination of the two). Instead of asking the interrogator whether the other party is a person or a computer program, we employ a forced-choice method and ask which of two systems is more human-like. By comparing a given model with a weighted sum of human and artificial systems, we fit a psychometric curve to the answers of the interrogator and extract a quantitative measure for the computer model in turns of similarity to the human handshake.;;;;"Levy-Tzedek, Shelly/E-8612-2017; Karniel, Amir/F-2066-2012; Nisky, Ilana/D-3578-2013";"Nisky, Ilana/0000-0003-4128-9771; Avraham, Guy/0000-0002-6170-1041";;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;978-3-642-14063-1;;;;2010;6191;;I;;;;197;204;;;;;;;;;WOS:000281598200029;;;;;;

Diagnosis, treatment and care of pressure ulcers are costly for health services. Accurate wound evaluation is a critical task for optimizing the efficacy of treatment and care. Prediction of wound evolution helps the effective management of health resources and planning of pharmacological treatment and health-care decisions. In this paper, different machine learning approaches have been designed and used to predict the evolution of pressure ulcers. These predictive systems are based on local features extracted from wound images which were weekly taken in uncontrolled lighting conditions. The images were automatically segmented by the mean-shift procedure. A group of clinical experts manually classified the segmented regions into five different tissue types, and a set of local descriptors based on area measurements of these tissues was extracted. The one-week evolution of two different indicators for pressure ulcer evaluation is predicted: the ratio between granulation and devitalized tissue, and the percentage of wound-bed border consisting of granulation tissue. Of the tens of machine learning approaches and architectures tested in this study, support vector machines, naive Bayes classifiers, neural networks and decision trees achieved the highest accuracy rates in the prediction of the two indicators above, with also acceptable sensitivity and positive predictive value rates. Feature selection significantly reduced the number of input features needed for prediction. Neural networks and decision trees gave the best performance results, and the C4.5 algorithm achieved the highest accuracy rate (similar to 81%) in the prediction of the granulation/devitalized ratio from a small number of input features.;;;;"Morente, Laura/L-4866-2014; Mesa Jimenez, Hector/I-6307-2018; , 叶叶叶/ABE-1619-2020; Veredas, Francisco/L-1334-2014";"Mesa Jimenez, Hector/0000-0002-9656-1456; Veredas, Francisco/0000-0003-0739-2505; Morilla Herrera, Juan Carlos/0000-0003-3814-4440";;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-989-674-016-0;;;;2010;;;;;;;5;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000299185100005;;;;;;

In order to gain more flexibility and to enhance existing e-learning platforms, the OPUS One LMS Extension package will enable a generic Intelligent Tutored Adaptive Learning Environment, based on a holistic Multidimensional Instructional Design Model (PENTHA ID Model), allowing Al based tutoring and adaptation functionality to existing Web-based e-learning systems. Relying on real time adapted profiles, it allows content- / course authors to apply a dynamic course design, supporting tutored, collaborative sessions and activities, as suggested by modem pedagogy. The concept presented combines a personalized level of surveillance, learning activity- and learning path adaptation suggestions to ensure the students learning motivation and learning success. The OPUS One concept allows to implement an advanced tutoring approach combining expert based e-tutoring with the more personal human tutoring function. It supplies the Human Tutor with precise, extended course activity data and adaptation suggestions based on predefined subject matter rules. The concept architecture is modular allowing a personalized platform configuration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0094-243X;;978-0-7354-0794-7;;;;2010;1247;;;;;;215;227;;10.1063/1.3460231;;;;;;;WOS:000282466500018;;;;;;

Normally, these improvements are reached with the use of some heuristics which either prune useless tree search branches or even indicate the path to reach the solution (many times, the optimal solution) more easily. Many heuristics were proposed in the literature, like Static/ Dynamic Highest Degree heuristic (SHD/DHD), Most Constraint Variable (MCV), Least Constraining Value (LCV), and while some can be used at the pre-processing time, others just at running time. In this paper we propose a new pre-processing search heuristic to reduce the amount of backtracking calls, namely the Least Suggested Value First (LSVF). LSVF emerges as a practical solution whenever the LCV can not distinguish how much a value is constrained. We present a pedagogical example to introduce the heuristics, realized through the general Constraint Logic Programming CHRv, as well as the preliminary results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-989-674-021-4;;;;2010;;;;;;;416;421;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392361600067;;;;;;

Specifically, a step by step procedure allowing updating the information once each item of information (OD-pair or link flow) becomes available. The method is illustrated by its application to a simple network. The results show that the proposed method provide useful information on which OD pair or link flows are informative on other OD pair and link flows, and that the method is applicable to large networks due to its numerical robustness and stability.;;;;"RIVAS, ANA/G-2751-2015; Gallego, Inmaculada/AAX-1949-2020; Gallego, Inmaculada/F-7504-2015";"RIVAS, ANA/0000-0001-5672-3572; Gallego, Inmaculada/0000-0001-9108-5692; Gallego, Inmaculada/0000-0001-9108-5692; Jimenez, Pilar/0000-0001-9289-6892";;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-989-674-021-4;;;;2010;;;;;;;560;567;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392361600094;;;;;;

Intelligent agents and multi-agent systems are widely used to implement intelligent mechanisms for ITSs due to their characteristics. The paper presents an agent based ITS for the course Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence named MIPITS. The MIPITS system is based on the holonic multi-agent architecture for ITS development. The system offers learning materials, provides practical problems and gives feedback to the learner about his/her solution evaluating his/her knowledge. The goal of the system is to realize individualized practical problem solving, which is not possible in the classroom due to the large number of students in the course. Thus, the main focus of the system is on problem solving. The system offers three types of problems: tests, state space search problems and two player games algorithm problems. The MINTS system is open: new types of problems can be added just by including appropriate agents in the system. The problems are adapted to the learner's knowledge level and preferences about difficulty, size and practicality of problems.;;;;"Grundspenkis, Janis/R-4643-2019; Lavendelis, Egons/E-3849-2017";"Grundspenkis, Janis/0000-0003-2526-4662; Lavendelis, Egons/0000-0001-9912-035X";;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-989-674-022-1;;;;2010;;;;;;;5;13;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392361900007;;;;;;

Unfortunately, depending on the complexity of the problem, high computational capabilities are required, primarily in those cases in which measuring the quality of a potential solution is very demanding. However, advances in Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to be more specific, could help users to deal with this situation by parallelizing the evolutionary program aiming to distribute the computational capabilities required.

This ontology represents the objects composing the environment, the agents operating in the environment and the events that can happened. In the virtual environment, different entities cohabit: virtual operators represented by cognitive agents and the learner's avatar that represents a real operator. They can interact with the objects. It is therefore useful to have on one hand a managing system that well define the framework in which the interactions or actions can be allowed and on the other hand a representation of the knowledge involve in such interactions. To do this, we combine artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering to propose agent COLOMBO.

In this context, the path planning and the observation of the agents were presented and also the detection of deviations in different situations was discussed. In this paper, we introduce control features of the system designed to deal with these types of deviations. That leads in turn to intervene in time when it is necessary, so that the system remains demonstrating robustness. Furthermore, this paper addresses the conflict between a central planning algorithm and the autonomy of the agents.

The holistic and embodied ideas expressed by this research promote the view that intelligence is an emergent phenomenon. Similar perspectives, where numerous interactions within the system lead to emergent properties and cognitive abilities beyond that of the individual parts, can be found within many scientific fields. With the goal of understanding how behavior may be represented in robots, the present review tries to grasp what this notion of emergence really means and compare it with a selection of theories developed for analysis of human cognition, including the extended mind, distributed cognition and situated action. These theories reveal a view of intelligence where common notions of objects, goals, language and reasoning have to be rethought. A view where behavior, as well as the agent as such, is defined by the observer rather than given by their nature. Structures in the environment emerge by interaction rather than recognized. In such a view, the fundamental question is how emergent systems appear and develop, and how they may be controlled.;;;;Billing, Erik/AAC-5790-2019;Billing, Erik/0000-0002-6568-9342;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-989-674-022-1;;;;2010;;;;;;;373;382;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392361900064;;;;;;

Virtually credit risk evaluation is a very typical classification problem to identify good and bad creditors. Currently some machine learning technologies, such as support vector machine (SVM), have been discussed widely in credit risk evaluation. But there are many effective classification methods in pattern recognition and artificial intelligence have not been tested for credit evaluation. This paper presents to use nearest subspace classification method, a successful face recognition method, for credit evaluation. The nearest subspace credit evaluation method use the subspaces spanned by the creditors in same class to extend the training set, and the Euclidean distance from a test creditor to the subspace is taken as the similarity measure for classification, then the test creditor belongs to the class of nearest subspace. Experiments on real world credit dataset show that the nearest subspace credit risk evaluation method is a competitive method.

This can result in horrific future sales. Therefore, keeping player engage in the game is much more important. This paper presents an artificial player that learns to adjust its skills to match a player it is playing against, without displaying unreasonable moves or performing sudden changes in its difficulty level. A Final Fantasy Tactics-like game is used in our experiment. We introduce evaluation functions for calculating the score from each unit's action.

The number of neurons in the hidden layers depends on the complexity of the problem to be represented. Currently, there are no reliable rules for determining, a priori, the number of hidden neurons, so that such number depends largely on the experience of the practitioners who are designing the ANNs. This paper reports experiment results using neural networks varying the number of hidden neurons to aid the neural network user to find an adequate configuration in terms of number of neurons in the hidden layers so that ANNs be more efficient particularly for fault identification applications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-989-8425-05-8;;;;2010;;;;;;;309;313;;;;;;;;;WOS:000393238700041;;;;;;

The proposed model is applied to a control system of a solar power plant, obtaining an architecture which optimizes agents for the problem. The agents in this system can cooperate and coordinate to achieve a global goal, encapsulate the hardware interfaces and make the control system easily adapt to different requirements through configuration.

This process is very complicated and difficult as multi-parameters changes are non linear and car drive cross structure is non homogeneous. This fact and lack of mathematical algorithms describing this process makes modeling properties of drives elements by traditional numerical methods difficult or even impossible. In this case it is possible to try using artificial neural network. Using neural networks for modeling carbonizing in fluidized bed is caused by several nets' features: non linear character, ability to generalize the results of calculations for data out of training set, no need for mathematical algorithms describing influence changes input parameters on modeling materials properties. The neural network structure is designed and special prepared by choosing input and output parameters of process. The method of learning and testing neural network, the way of limiting nets structure and minimizing learning and testing error are discussed. Such prepared neural network model, after putting expected values of car cross driving properties in output layer, can give answers to a lot of questions about running carbonizing process in fluidized bed. The practical implications of the neural network models are possibility of using they to build control system capable of on-line controlling running process and supporting engineering decision in real time. The originality of this research is different conception to obtain foreseen materials properties after carbonizing in fluidized bed. The specially prepared neural networks model could be a help for engineering decisions and may be used in designing carbonizing process in fluidized bed as well as in controlling changes of this process.;;;;;Szota, Michal/0000-0002-8147-1052;;;;;;;;;;;;2100-014X;;;;;;2010;6;;;;;;;;19001;10.1051/epjconf/20100619001;;;;;;;WOS:000291704000090;;;;;;

However, currently a large part of the robotics industry is driven by the development of killer applications capable of causing tremendous amount of human suffering and harm. We propose a twofold solution to the ethical dilemma: external ethical guidelines combined with intrinsic engineering practices. As a first step to help mitigate the anticipated problems, governments and international organizations should promote a generally accepted codification of roboethics. This codification should comprise a basic set of hard boundaries that must not be crossed under any circumstances. The first step can be seen as an external ethics approach. As a second step, we propose that the residual ethical risk should be taken into consideration by implementing an oath for technology developers, analogous to the Hippocratic oath. We understand this oath as an internal ethical risk management tool that increases developer's awareness of ethical machine development while leaving an appropriate level of latitude for making individual decisions. Furthermore, we show how to implement the oath as a machine design principle. This hybrid approach can also be seen as a tool for cross-cultural application of ethical principles in the design process. We use robotics as an example case, but the oath concept goes beyond guidelines for specific development areas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-934272-84-8;;;;2010;;;;;;;125;130;;;;;;;;;WOS:000391415300025;;;;;;

It is highly multi-disciplinary, involving several diverse and interdependent subsystems all critical to mission success. In the typical approach, subsystem experts gather and flesh out design concepts over the timescale of weeks, melding analyses from multiple heterogeneous modeling tools and iterating until a sound design is settled upon. However, due to the need for collocation, the incongruity of design information from disparate tools and the inefficiencies inherent in the iterative process, this process remains expensive, error prone and slow. Technology that can automate and optimize the spacecraft design process to lower costs while maintaining reliability has been identified as one potential solution. However, due to the prohibitively expansive searchable space implied in spacecraft design, most tools of this kind can consider only a very limited subset of design variables and can be unreliable, inefficient and prone to generating unrealistic or suboptimal designs. The Systems Platform for Integrated Design in Realtime (SPIDR)(1), a project underway at USC's Information Sciences Institute and Space Engineering Research Center (SERC), presents a unique approach to this problem. SPIDR's search and optimization engine utilizes innovative applications of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to quickly generate provably optimal results. The application of AI planning techniques enables consideration of the entire design space by starting search from a high-level problem specification, while constraint propagation offers an analog to the concept of iteration, where all variables are defined as interval domains and shrunk according to rules and constraints until provably optimal single point solutions are discovered. With a unique architecture that utilizes a knowledge-based information system, a powerful combination of mathematical approach and optimization algorithm, and the inclusion of socio-technical factors specific to spacecraft development, SPIDR demonstrates the potential to be a valuable addition to the toolkits of engineers in both industry and academia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-934272-84-8;;;;2010;;;;;;;168;173;;;;;;;;;WOS:000391415300033;;;;;;

Neural networks have created a new and advancing frontier in power electronics, which is already a complex and multidisciplinary technology that is going through dynamic evolution in the recent years. But recently, a new type of the intelligent techniques, for control and decision making processes, was introduced that is based on the emotion processing mechanism in brain, and is essentially an action selection, which is based on sensory inputs and emotional cues. This intelligent control is inspired by the limbic system of mammalian brain. The proposed controller is called brain emotional learning based intelligent controller (BELBIC). This paper gives a comprehensive introduction and perspective of its applications in the intelligent control for electric drives area. The principal topologies of neural networks that are currently most relevant for applications in power electronics have been reviewed including the detailed description of their properties. Both feedforward and feedback or recurrent architectures have been covered in the description. The application examples that are discussed in this paper include different electric drives control as: Direct Current Motors (DC), Alternative Current Motors (AC) and Special Motors (SRM). In addition, almost all of the selected applications in the literature are included in the references. In the experimental and simulation works, novel and simple implementations of the drives system were achieved by using the intelligent controller, which control the motor speed accurately in different operating points. This emotional intelligent controller has simple structure with high auto learning feature that does not require any motor parameters, for self performance. The proposed emotional controller has been experimentally implemented in some of the laboratory electric drives, and shows excellent promise for industrial scale utilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1553-572X;;978-1-4244-5226-2;;;;2010;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000300146001143;;;;;;

The main contribution of this work is to present how LVF data mining technique improves Sarsa(lambda) algorithm combined with tile-coding technique by selecting the most relevant features and actions from reinforcement learning environments. The objective of this selection is to reduce the complexity of the problem and the amount of memory used by the agent thus leading to faster convergence. The motivation of this work was inspired by the rationale behind Occam's razor, which describes that a complex model tends to be less accurate than another with a lower complexity. The difficulty in using data mining techniques in reinforcement learning environments is due to the lack of data in a database, so this paper proposes a storage schema for states visited and actions performed by the agent. In this study, the selection of features and actions are applied to a specific problem of RoboCup soccer, the dribble. This problem is composed of 20 continuous variables and 113 actions available to the agent which results in a memory consumption of approximately 4.5mb when the traditional Sarsa(lambda) algorithm is used combined with the tile-coding technique. The experiments' results show that the amount of variables in the environment were reduced by 35% and the amount of actions by 65%, which resulted in a reduction in memory consumption of 43% and an increase in performance of up to 23%, according to the relative frequency distribution of agent's success.

The functionality of agents of this architecture has been inspired by Marvin Minsky's definition of the term in his book The Society of Mind (1986) [1]. Minsky, widely considered to be one of the fathers of artificial intelligence, tried to describe from an engineering point of view, in this book, how he thought the mind works: I'll call Society of Mind this scheme in which each mind is made of many smaller processes. These we'll call agents. Each mental agent by itself can only do some simple thing that needs no mind or thought at all. Yet when we join these agents in societies-in certain very special ways-this leads to true intelligence. Societies of simple behaving agents have been implemented in Fatronik, in real robots, and have been demonstrated to be able to perform complex tasks in industrial environments. This article explains the features of such societies of agents and presents their implementation in a real robot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4244-6391-6;;;;2010;;;;;;;3515;3520;;;;;;;;;WOS:000295007804088;;;;;;

But owing to inexpressive representations, autonomous robots hardly conduct efficient tasks planning, especially in unknown conditions. The application of semantic knowledge in task planning is critically required in artificial intelligence research. In this paper, we focus on two topics: semantic knowledge representations and parallel planning for uncertainties. Firstly, a semantic memory system which is called EpistemeBase is proposed for indoor tasks planning, it includes five parallel agents: Assertion, Plan, Anticipation, Behaviour and Effect. Its framework is an evolving process, which consists of Datum, Information, Knowledge and Intelligence. Secondly, the same task planning is synchronously represented by five paralleled agents. This paralleled structure can well accelerate the process of tasks planning as well as better handle it under uncertainties. Finally, the experiment of tasks planning is conducted for measuring the reaction time of planning and uncertainties by using the EpistemeBase and the Open Mind Common Sense (OMCS) respectively.;;;;Xiong, Xiaofeng/AAE-5443-2019;Xiong, Xiaofeng/0000-0001-5358-3498;;;;;;;;;;;;2153-0858;;978-1-4244-6675-7;;;;2010;;;;;;;4503;4508;;10.1109/IROS.2010.5650956;;;;;;;WOS:000287672001114;;;;;;

On the doorstep of life-like architecture we use virtual reality to begin to answer these questions. We are brought to this doorstep through the potential convergence of emerging adaptive, reactive and organic architecture and the approaches that have made life like virtual agents both engaging and useful. The scene is set by introducing the concept of Adaptive Appraisive Architecture, in which a building could appear to exhibit life like appearance and behaviour. While being impressive would such a building be pleasant and useful? Before building the physical structure or coding the artificial intelligence this paper measures the impact of being within a room with moving walls on experience and performance. To do this we gave test subjects two jigsaw puzzles and placed them within a life size simulation where the walls move then remain static. The impact of this difference is measured on experience through questionnaire and post interview. The impact on performance is measured in terms of the amount of the puzzle solved. The relevance of the results are not constrained to adaptive architecture as they add to the body of knowledge that relate distractions to concentration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1087-8270;;978-1-4244-6258-2;;;;2010;;;;;;;131;134;;10.1109/VR.2010.5444801;;;;;;;WOS:000287516000023;;;;;;

The RSR is a set of primitive relations used for building a specific kind of semantic networks for artificial intelligence applications on the web: the RSN (Rhetorical-Semantic Networks). We bring into focus the RSR application in the field of e-learning, by defining Didactic Networks as a new set of semantic patterns oriented to the development of e-learning applications. The different lines we offer in our research fall mainly into three levels: The most basic one is in the field of computational linguistics and related to Logical Operations on RSR (RSR Inverses and plurals, RSR combinations, etc), once they have been created. The application of Walter Bosma's results regarding rhetorical distance application and treatment as semantic weighted networks is one of the important issues here. In parallel, we have been working on the creation of a knowledge representation and storage model and data architecture capable of supporting the definition of knowledge networks based on RSR. The third strategic line is in the meso-level, the formulation of a molecular structure of knowledge based on the most frequently used patterns. The main contribution at this level is the set of Fundamental Cognitive Networks (FCN) as an application of Novak's mental maps proposal. This paper is part of this third intermediate level, and the Fundamental Didactic Networks (FDN) are the result of the application of rhetorical theory procedures to the instructional theory. We have formulated a general set of RSR capable of building discourse, making it possible to express any concept, procedure or principle in terms of knowledge nodes and RSRs. The Instructional knowledge can then be elaborated in the same way. This network structure expressing the instructional knowledge in terms of RSR makes the objective of developing web-learning lessons semi-automatically possible, as well as any other type of utilities oriented towards the exploitation of semantic structure, such as the automatic question answering systems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-936338-12-2;;;;2010;;;;;;;302;309;;;;;;;;;WOS:000391343600059;;;;;;

Particularly, several challenges arise to machine learning systems when inducing a model describing legal moves of the chess, including the collection of the examples, the learning of a model correctly representing the official rules of the game, covering all the branches and restrictions of the correct moves, and the comprehensibility of such a model. Besides, the game of chess has inspired the creation of numerous variants, ranging from faster to more challenging or to regional versions of the game. The question arises if it is possible to take advantage of an initial classifier of chess as a starting point to obtain classifiers for the different variants. We approach this problem as an instance of theory revision from examples. The initial classifier of chess is inspired by a FOL theory approved by a chess expert and the examples are defined as sequences of moves within a game. Starting from a standard revision system, we argue that abduction and negation are also required to best address this problem. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.;;;;"Zaverucha, Gerson/M-2290-2013; Paes, Aline/C-5989-2019; Costa, Vitor Santos/B-2859-2012; INESC-TEC, CRACS/F-7527-2012";"Paes, Aline/0000-0002-9089-7303; Costa, Vitor Santos/0000-0002-3344-8237; ";;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;978-3-642-13839-3;;;;2010;5989;;;;;;123;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000286783400012;;;;;;

The task of inferring hidden states, e.g. the activities or intentions of people, based on observations is called filtering. Standard probabilistic models such as Dynamic Bayesian Networks are able to solve this task efficiently using approximative methods such as particle filters. However, these models do not support logical or relational representations. The key contribution of this paper is the upgrade of a particle filter algorithm for use with a probabilistic logical representation through the definition of a proposal distribution. The performance of the algorithm depends largely on how well this distribution fits the target distribution. We adopt the idea of logical compilation into Binary Decision Diagrams for sampling. This allows us to use the optimal proposal distribution which is normally prohibitively slow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-13839-3;;;;2010;5989;;;;;;226;233;;;;;;;;;WOS:000286783400022;;;;;;

Since the ordinary local search heuristics very seldom yield solutions of high quality, we investigate the enhanced local search algorithms using the extended neighbourhood structures. We also examine the performance of the local search heuristics in an iterated local search paradigm based on the deterministic descent-random ascent methodology. Our new heuristic algorithms are tested on the symmetric TSP instances taken from the publicly available electronic library of the TSP instances (TSPLIB). The results from the experiments demonstrate that our heuristics appear to be superior to traditional types of local search algorithms.;;;;Misevicius, Alfonsas/A-2695-2008;Misevicius, Alfonsas/0000-0002-3746-8200;;;;;;;;;;;;2029-0020;;;;;;2010;;;;;;;47;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000314082000005;;;;;;

In geotechnical engineering, various types of information technology, such as geographical information system (GIS), artificial intelligence (AI), and numerical simulation, are now being actively used to predict, visualize, and analyze physical parameters. In this paper, the recent development in integration of IT into geotechnical engineering fields are presented with emphasis on the use of GIS in tunnelling risk management. A combined technique that couples the artificial neural network (ANN) and the GIS is then presented. The proposed approach involves the development of ANN(s) using a calibrated finite element model(s) for use as a prediction tool and implementation of the developed ANN(s) into a GIS platform for visualization and analysis of spatial distribution of predicted results. A novel feature of the proposed approach is an ability to expedite a routine geotechnical design process that otherwise require significant time and effort in performing numerical analyses for different design scenarios. Two illustrative examples in which the developed approach was implemented are given; one for an urban tunnelling design project and the other for a soft ground improvement design project. It is shown that the proposed approach can be an efficient and robust decision making tool for routine geotechnical design works. This paper describes the concept and details of the proposed approach and its implementation to an urban tunnel and a soft ground improvement design projects.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"978-1-60750-617-1; 978-1-60750-616-4";;;;2010;;;;;;;19;36;;10.3233/978-1-60750-617-1-19;;;;;;;WOS:000347154900002;;;;;;

In this system, student performance depends on exam results and is evaluated only as success or failure. Alternative, non-classical performance evaluation methods may be used, such as fuzzy logic, a mathematical technique of set-theory that can be applied to many forms of decision-making including research on engineering and artificial intelligence. This study proposes a new performance evaluation method based on fuzzy logic systems. Student performance of Control Technique Laboratory in Marmara University Technical Education Faculty, Electricity Education Department, was carried out with fuzzy logic and it was compared with classical evaluating method. Study samples are notes which twenty students took the control technique laboratory course. Evaluation of the results showed variations between the classical and fuzzy logic methods. Although performance evaluation using fuzzy logic is complicated and requires additional software, it provides some evaluation advantages. Fuzzy logic evaluation is flexible and provides many evaluation options, while the classical method adheres to constant mathematical calculation. At the application stage, the teacher responsible for the laboratory application can edit the ranges of membership functions and rules, permitting non-homogenous but flexible and objective performance evaluation.

The most common constraints of a WSN are the energy consumption, the network nodes organization, the sensor network's task reprogramming, the reliability in the data transmission, the resource optimization (memory and processing), etc. In the Artificial Intelligence Area is has proposed an Distributed System Approach with Mobile Intelligent Agents. An Integration Model of Mobile Intelligent Agents within Wireless Sensor Network solves some of the constraints presented above on WSN's topologies.

Nor is the comparison of the relatively new, and unknown for many, additive processes that have emerged and grown in number over the last two decades. A number of computer based systems and web based tools for Rapid Manufacturing (RM) selection have appeared overtime, however the definitive solution is far from having been reached. The assumption that every RM process can be uniformly parameterized and normalized In order to be compared restricts their real potential and provides rather unclear criteria for an accurate comparison. The RM evaluation method proposed herein splits the selection factors into: technical, economical and materials assessment. It makes use of matrix algebra and a number of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as fuzzy logic, neural network modelling and expert systems, which are implemented in order to allow for more appropriate qualitative criteria for RM selection.

It is difficult to predict torrential rainfalls because of their character. Usage of the nowcasting methods (weather forecast with two hour validity) holds hope. The torrential rainfall prediction should be followed by a suitable hydrological model able to estimate at least the resultant peak outflow. The hydrological models construction interferes with high measure of uncertainty, inherent in the rainfall prediction, rainfall-runoff process and its simulation. The way how to eliminate influence of uncertainty is using fuzzy logic and other artificial intelligence methods.

Different problems can be solved in these fields by creating societies of agents that communicate with each other. Nevertheless, when the number of agents is large and the connectivity is extensive, the system suffers from overhead in the communication among agents due to the large number messages exchanged. This work addresses the search for an optimal communication topology to avoid these situations. This optimal topology is characterized by the use of a redirecting probability in the communication. The redirection of a communication is performed before the execution of the MAS. Once agents start the execution, the topology is fixed and remains unchanged. This characteristic is useful in those systems where a given topology can not be changed as, for example, in wired networks. On the other hand, in the proposed solution agents contain a local message discrimination process as a function of the sender of the message. Experiments show an important improvement in terms of a reduction in the number of iterations needed to solve the problem and also in the number of messages exchanged.;;;;"Varona, Pablo/B-5583-2012; Camacho, David/AAV-3665-2020; Camacho, David/B-5779-2014; Pardo, Antonio Gonzalez/ABB-7444-2020; de Borja Rodriguez, Francisco/F-7812-2013";"Varona, Pablo/0000-0002-1754-8991; Camacho, David/0000-0002-5051-3475; Pardo, Antonio Gonzalez/0000-0002-1558-9239; de Borja Rodriguez, Francisco/0000-0003-4053-099X";;;;;;;;;;;;1860-949X;;978-3-642-15210-8;;;;2010;315;;;;;;131;141;;;;;;;;;WOS:000287889200014;;;;;;

Two parallel approaches for the ABC were implemented: a master-slave and a hybrid-hierarchical. Experiments were done for tuning the parameters of the ABC, as well as to adjust the load balance in a cluster-based computing environment. The performance of the parallel models was compared with a sequential version for 4 benchmark instances.

The design scheme has been successfully applied to solve different types of linear and nonlinear ordinary fractional differential equations. The results were compared with exact solutions, approximate analytic solution and standard numerical techniques. In case of linear ordinary fractional differential equations, relatively more accurate solutions were obtained than standard numerical methods. However, for complex nonlinear fractional differential equation, the same scheme is applicable, hut with reduced accuracy.

Whenever reasonable predictions with less bias are produced by investors, great profit will be made. As the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms has arisen in recent years, it has played an important role to help people forecast the future. In the stock market, many forecasting models were advanced by academy researchers to forecast stock price such as time series, technical analysis and fuzzy time-series models. However, there are some drawbacks in the past models: (I) strict statistical assumptions are required; (2) objective human judgments are involved in forecasting procedure; and (3) a proper threshold is not easy to be found. For the reasons above, a novel forecasting model based on variation and trend pattern is proposed in this paper. To verify the forecasting performance of the proposed model, the TAIEX (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index) of the year 2000, is used as experimental dataset and two past fuzzy time-series models are used as comparison models.

This contribution tries to clarify the concept of cognitive effort, by introducing its main influencing factors and by presenting a formalism which provides us with a tool for precise discussion. The formalism is implementable as a computational concept and can therefore be embedded in an artificial agent and tested experimentally.

Comparative commonsense, such as In general, a man is stronger than a woman, denotes that one entity has a property or quality greater or less in extent than that of another. This paper presents an automatic method for acquiring comparative commonsense from the World Wide Web. We firstly extract potential comparative statements from related texts based on multiple lexico-syntactic patterns. Then, we assess the candidates using Web-scale statistical features. To evaluate this approach, we use three measures: coverage of the web corpora, precision and recall which achieved 79.2%, 76.4% and 83.3%, respectively in our experiments.

In this pap, we propose that storytelling in sports is a challenging and rich problem for Artificial Intelligence (AI) research for the following reasons. First, storytelling is considered to be a very human activity as it requires engaging the audience in a story and appealing to their factual as well as emotional sides. Thus, automating it will be an advance in AI. Second, while automated storytelling in general has received ample attention storytelling in sports has seen much less research. Third, an AI storyteller can be used as an assistant to a human color commentator in a real game, or autonomously in the context of a sports video game.

The operation of an amine-based CO2 capture system is complicated and involves monitoring over one hundred process parameters and careful manipulation of numerous valves and pumps. The monitoring and control of critical parameters of the process is an important task because it directly impacts plant performance and capture efficiency of CO2. In this study, artificial intelligence techniques were applied to develop a knowledge-based expert system that aims to effectively monitor and control the CO2 capture process, and thereby enhance CO2 capture efficiency. The Knowledge-Based System for Carbon Dioxide Capture (KBSCDC) was implemented with DeltaV Simulate (trademark of Emerson Corp., USA). DeltaV Simulate provides control utilities and algorithms which support the configuration of control strategies in modular components. The KBSCDC can conduct real-time monitoring and diagnosis, as well as suggest remedies for any abnormality detected. Also, the control strategies applied to the control devices of the process are simulated in KBSCDC. The expert system enhances performance and efficiency of the CO2 capture system because it supports automated diagnosis of the system should any abnormal conditions occur. In developing the system, the Inferential Modeling Technique (IMT) was applied to analyze the domain knowledge and problem-solving techniques. The knowledge base of KBSCDC can be shared and reused, and can contribute to future study of the CO2 capture process.

It enhances the energy efficient and reliable operation of power system. Forecasting of load demand data forms an important component in planning generation schedules in a power system. The purpose of this paper is to identify issues and better method for load foecasting. In this paper we focus on fuzzy logic system based short term load forecasting. It serves as overview of the state of the art in the intelligent techniques employed for load forecasting in power system planning and reliability. Literature review has been conducted and fuzzy logic method has been summarized to highlight advantages and disadvantages of this technique. The proposed technique for implementing fuzzy logic based forecasting is by Identification of the specific day and by using maximum and minimum temperature for that day and finally listing the maximum temperature and peak load for that day. The results show that Load forecasting where there are considerable changes in temperature parameter is better dealt with Fuzzy Logic system method as compared to other short term forecasting techniques.;;;;"Holmukhe, Rajesh M/H-4044-2016; Chaudhari, Parag/AAW-9732-2020";"Holmukhe, Rajesh M/0000-0003-3696-826X; Chaudhari, Parag/0000-0002-9021-9713";;;;;;;;;;;;0094-243X;;978-0-7354-0854-8;;;;2010;1298;;;;;;445;+;;10.1063/1.3516348;;;;;;;WOS:000287122200070;;;;;;

The proposed technique combines the learning ability of neural network with the transparent linguistic representation of fuzzy system. The technique is applied to forecast discharge at a downstream station using flow information at various upstream stations. A total of three years data has been selected for the implementation of this model. ANFIS models with various input structures and membership functions are constructed, trained and tested to evaluate efficiency of the models. Statistical indices such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Correlation Coefficient (CORR) and Coefficient of Efficiency (CE) are used to evaluate performance of the ANFIS models in forecasting river flood. The values of the indices show that ANFIS model can accurately and reliably be used to forecast flood in a river system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0094-243X;;978-0-7354-0854-8;;;;2010;1298;;;;;;694;699;;10.1063/1.3516407;;;;;;;WOS:000287122200108;;;;;;

The framework is based on the integration of two different knowledge representation formats. The integration consists of the Rule-base and the Case-based formats using the Blackboard. This scheme uses both procedural and declarative knowledge representation formalisms through the application of relational data base. So the rule base and case base formats have been converted into tables. In this paper all the algorithms, for creating, indexing, and checking the availability of a rule and a case, are present. The scheme facilitates combination of forward and backward chaining reasoning, using many problem solving methodologies, and different searching techniques. This view is based on the philosophy of human memory organization and utilization. Also individual uses the common sense, deduction and analogical reasoning activities in order to be more efficient for solving problems. Therefore, the proposed scheme facilitates the common sense, deduction and analogical reasoning activities in the inference engine, because rule base provides the deduction, case base provides the analogical reasoning, and the blackboard provides the common sense. The scheme makes the proposed Rule-Case-based shell expert system more flexible, efficient, and more powerful for the development of the expert systems in future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2078-0958;;978-988-17012-8-2;;;;2010;;;;;;;81;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000303703800015;;;;;;

In this paper, a fuzzy logic-controlled shunt active power filter capable of reducing the total harmonic distortion is developed. The optimal controllers for the control of DC voltage response of condenser and the inverter current of shunt active filter are designed by an artificial intelligence technique. The instantaneous p-q theory is used for calculating the compensating current. Fuzzy-adaptive hysteresis band technique is adopted for the current control to derive the switching signals for the voltage source inverter. The fuzzy-adaptive hysteresis band current controller changes the hysteresis bandwidth according to the supply voltage and the slope of the reference compensator current wave. A fuzzy logic-based controller is developed to control the voltage of the DC capacitor. Simulation results obtained are presented and compared with the conventional controller.

However it is still not perfect particularly when employed to solve complicated geographical problems. Urgently needed improvement includes development of geographic data representation modeling and design of algorithm for spatial similarity computation and reasoning. This paper reports an improved CBR-based method for studying the spatially and temporally complex Mesoscale Ocean Eddies (MOEs). After summarizes the basic advantages and challenges of current existing quantitative methods, the paper first proposes that CBR approach, with support of GIS, can be employed to study variation of MOEs. Representation model was constructed to describe the case, i.e., MOEs. This paper then provides an algorithm to retrieve the inherent spatial relationships among cases, as well as a CBR similarity reasoning algorithm to predict change of MOEs. The method was finally tested by examining the MOE in the South China Sea and yields an average estimation accuracy of 80%. In summary, the CBR-based approach proposed in this study provides an effective and explicit solution to quantitatively analyze and predict the change of MOEs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1682-1750;2194-9034;;;;;2010;38;;2;;;;104;108;;;;;;;;;WOS:000358220500020;;;;;;

Effective asset management helps utilities to meet this challenge; however, this requires the utilization of cost-effective approaches for assessing asset condition, performance and remaining service life. A key component of these approaches requires an understanding of asset lifetimes. This paper discusses the role of asset lifetimes in asset management and the current state of the art for prediction of remaining life using different approaches. It discusses very simple approaches based on assumed lives, as well as sophisticated mathematical approaches using deterministic, statistical, physical/probabilistic and artificial intelligence models. In analysing both asset management strategies and lifetime prediction methodologies, a key factor identified as missing is a standardized technique for the incorporation of lifetime models into the probability side of risk analysis.

The system LJ is known as useful for representing incomplete information, and SLJ is obtained from LJ by adding a sequence modal operator which can represent sequential information.

In this paper we discuss the issues and lessons learned from our experience of integrating PowerAqua as a front-end for DBpedia and a subset of Linked Data sources. As such, we go one step beyond the state of the art on end-users interfaces for Linked Data by introducing mapping and fusion techniques needed to translate a user query by means of multiple sources. Our first informal experiments probe whether, in fact, it is feasible to obtain answers to user queries by composing information across semantic sources and Linked Data, even in its current form, where the strength of Linked Data is more a by-product of its size than its quality. We believe our experiences can be extrapolated to a variety of end-user applications that wish to scale, open up, exploit and re-use what possibly is the greatest wealth of data about everything in the history of Artificial Intelligence.;;;;;"mascarell, josep/0000-0002-6892-3181; Motta, Enrico/0000-0003-0015-1952; d'Aquin, Mathieu/0000-0001-7276-4702; Uren, Victoria/0000-0002-1303-5574; Sabou, Marta/0000-0001-9301-8418";;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;978-3-642-16437-8;;;;2010;6317;;;;;;193;210;;;;;;;;;WOS:000312832300014;;;;;;

Particularly, Trading-oriented Decision Support Systems based on the Chartist or Technical Analysis Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) have been published and used worldwide. However, its combination with Neural Networks as a branch of computational intelligence which can outperform previous results remain a relevant approach which has not deserved enough attention. In this paper, we present the Chartist Analysis Platform for Trading (CAST, in short) platform, a proof-of-concept architecture and implementation of a Trading Decision Support System based on the RSI and Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN).

In recent years, many groups have developed different computer-assisted management systems of GL. Each approach has its own peculiarities and thus a comparison is necessary. Many possible aspects can be analyzed, but a first analysis has probably to consider the GL models, i.e. the representation formalisms provided. To this end, Peleg and al. [4] have analyzed and compared six different frameworks. In this paper, we analyse also GLARE and GPROVE on the basis of the same methodology. Moreover, we extend such analysis by considering the tools and the facilities that GLARE and GPROVE provide to support the use of GLs.

Skiadopoulos proposed a formal model for representing direction relations between compound regions (the finite union of simple regions), known as SK-model. It perhaps is currently one of most cognitive plausible models for qualitative direction information, and has attracted interests from artificial intelligence and geographic information system. Originating from Allen first using composition table to process time interval constraints; composing has become the key technique in qualitative spatial reasoning to check the consistency. Due to the massive number of basic directions in SK-model, its composition becomes extraordinary complex. This paper proposed a novel algorithm for the composition. Basing the concepts of smallest rectangular directions and its original directions, it transforms the composition of basic cardinal direction relations into the composition of interval relations corresponding to Allen's interval algebra. Comparing with existing methods, this algorithm has quite good dimensional extendibility, that is, it can be easily transferred to the tridimensional space with a few modifications.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-15279-5;;;;2010;6291;;;;;;111;120;;;;;;;;;WOS:000312596500013;;;;;;

Unfortunately, there are no widely accepted definitions of autonomy, life or being. Using a new cognitive agent architecture we argue that autonomy is a key ingredient for both life and being, and set about exploring autonomy as a concept and a capability. Some schools of thought regard autonomy as the key characteristic that distinguishes a system from an agent; agents are systems with autonomy, but rarely is a definition of autonomy provided. Living entities are autonomous systems, and autonomy is vital to life. Intelligence presupposes autonomy too; what would it mean for a system to be intelligent but not exhibit any form of genuine autonomy. Our philosophical, scientific and legal understanding of autonomy and its implications is immature and as a result progress towards designing, building, managing, exploiting and regulating autonomous systems is retarded. In response we put forward a framework for exploring autonomy as a concept and capability based on a new cognitive architecture. Using this architecture tools and benchmarks can be developed to analyze and study autonomy in its own right as a means to further our understanding of autonomous systems, life and being. This endeavor would lead to important practical benefits for autonomous systems design and help determine the legal status of autonomous systems. It is only with a new enabling understanding of autonomy that the dream of Artificial Intelligence and Artificial Life can be realized. We argue that designing systems with genuine autonomy capabilities can be achieved by focusing on agent experiences of being rather than attempting to encode human experiences as symbolic knowledge and know-how in the artificial agents we build.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-15279-5;;;;2010;6291;;;;;;137;147;;;;;;;;;WOS:000312596500015;;;;;;

However, most of the problems that are addressed in the Semantic Web were tackled by the artificial intelligence community, in the past. Within this period, Logic Programming emerged as a complete framework ranging from a sound formal theory, based on Horn clauses, to a declarative description language and an operational behavior that can be executed. Logic programming and its extensions have been already used in various approaches in the Semantic Web or the traditional Web context. In this work, we investigate the use of Modular Logic Programming, i.e. Logic Programming extended with modules, to address issues of the Semantic Web ranging from the ontology layer to reasoning and agents. These techniques provide a uniform framework ranging from the data layer to the higher layers of logic, avoiding the problem of incompatibilities of technologies related with different Semantic Web layers. What is more is that it can operate directly on top of existent World Wide Web sources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;978-3-642-15279-5;;;;2010;6291;;;;;;354;365;;;;;;;;;WOS:000312596500033;;;;;;

Man-made systems, such as computer applications, use a set of known rules to control the behaviours applied in a strict manner. Biological or natural systems employ unknown rules, these being undiscovered rules which are more complex. These rules are unknown due to the inability to determine how they are applied, unless observed by a third party. The swarm is one of the largest naturally observed systems, with bird flocks and ant colonies being the most notable. It is a collection or group of individuals who use behaviours to complete a given goal or objective. It is the aim of this paper to present rule discovery methods for the mining of these unknown rules within a swarm system, employing a bird flock simulation environment to gather data.;;;;;Moore, George/0000-0003-1623-0014;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;978-3-642-15279-5;;;;2010;6291;;;;;;506;517;;;;;;;;;WOS:000312596500046;;;;;;

The problem asks to construct a classifier that predicts the classes of future samples with high accuracy. For K = 2, we have studied a new visual classifier named 2-class SE-graph based classifier (2-SEC) in our previous works, which is constructed as follows: We first create several decision tables from the training set and extract a bipartite graph called an SE-graph that represents the relationship between the training set and the decision tables. We draw the SE-graph as a two-layered drawing by using an edge crossing minimization technique, and the resulting drawing acts as a visual classifier. We can extend 2-SEC to K-SEC for K > 2 naturally, but this extension does not consider the relationship between classes, and thus may perform badly on some data sets. In this paper, we propose SEC-TREE classifier for K > 2, which decomposes the given K-class problem into subproblems for fewer classes. Following our philosophy, we employ edge crossing minimization technique for this decomposition. Compared to previous decomposition strategies, SEC-TREE can extract any tree as the subproblem hierarchy. In computational studies, SEC-TREE outperforms C4.5 and is competitive with SVM especially when K is large.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-13799-0;;;;2010;6073;;;;;;169;+;;10.1007/978-3-642-13800-3_13;;;;;;;WOS:000282833800013;;;;;;

Pheromone used by ants to communicate via the environment is also simulated, and from the communication and interaction of the swarm with the environment (an image) there results a kind of drawing made with the simulated pheromone. Since ants are able to detect the edges of the image, the outcome is a sketch that resembles the original image, as with old camera obscura drawings. This text explores the observable traits shared by the photographic process and the swarm's pheromone maps. The theme is discussed in the context of the emergent artificial art research field; recent theoretical advances that link swarm intelligence and cognitive sciences are also addressed.";;;;Fernandes, Carlos M./N-7928-2016;Fernandes, Carlos M./0000-0002-1594-6785;;;;;;;;;;;;0024-094X;1530-9282;;;;;2010;43;2;;;;;107;112;;10.1162/leon.2010.43.2.107;;;;;;;WOS:000277230800002;;;;;;

This objective of the present paper is to integrate two different artificial intelligence techniques namely artificial neural network(ANN) and genetic algorithm(GA) for optimizing medium composition for the production of BGL on submerged fermentations(SmF). Specifically, the ANN and GA were used for modeling non-linear process and optimizing the process. The experimental data reported in a previous study for statistical optimization were used to build the ANN model. The concentrations of the four medium components served as inputs to the ANN model and the (beta-glucosidase activity as the output of the model. The average error (%) and correlation coefficient for the ANN model were 1.36 and 0.998, respectively. The input parameters of ANN model were subsequently optimized using the GA. The ANN-GA model predicted a maximum beta-glucosidase activity of 2.679U/ml at the optimun medium composition. The ANN-GA model predicted gave a 22% increase of beta-glucosidase activity over the statistical optimization, which was in good agreement with the actual experiment under the optimum conditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-15614-4;;;;2010;6330;;;;;;325;+;;10.1007/978-3-642-15615-1_39;;;;;;;WOS:000289457200039;;;;;;

Most text processing research has focused on locating mission-relevant text (information retrieval) and on techniques for enriching text by transforming it to other forms of text (translation, summarization) - always for use by humans. In contrast, MR will make knowledge contained in text available in forms that machines can use for automated processing. This will be done with little human intervention. Machines will learn to read from a few examples and they will read to learn what they need in order to answer questions or perform some reasoning task. Three independent Reading Teams are building universal text engines which will capture knowledge from naturally occurring text and transform it into the formal representations used by Artificial Intelligence. An Evaluation Team is selecting and annotating text corpora with task domain concepts, creating model reasoning systems with which the reading systems will interact, and establishing question-answer sets and evaluation protocols to measure progress toward this goal.

It overcomes the shortcomings of ISO 6983 by specifying machining processes rather than machine motion, using the object-oriented concept of working step. Although the STEP-NC contains abundant geometry information of part and associated process parameters, the tool path is general not included in the STEP-NC program. So before the beginning of the STEP-NC-compliant CNC machining, the tool path should be firstly designed. By analyzing the characteristic of STEP-NC data model for milling, a working step-oriented tool path planning method for milling was proposed in this paper, and the distributed artificial intelligence methods, namely collaborative multi-agent was employed to accomplish tool path planning. Firstly a multi-agent architecture was constructed to allow multiple agents to work cooperatively to realize automation of tool path planning, and then, the function of every kind of agent and the communication between the agents were all described in detail.

Analysis of geometrical shape of the projection of the wave profile in the specimen seams demonstrated that waves occupy not the whole working part of the test sample. This fact influences subjective perception of creasy surface, therefore, complex evaluation of the defect requires indicators with respect to sharpness of waves and relative length of the creasy portion. The applied method for assessment of puckering enabled to determine various puckering of the flexible fabrics assembled under different modes as well as to compare different puckering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1392-1320;2029-7289;;;;;2010;16;2;;;;;154;158;;;;;;;;;WOS:000280099700011;;;;;;

Automated or semi-automated gait analysis systems are important in assisting physicians in the diagnosis of various diseases. However, these systems are not only highly sophisticated but also require superior quality cameras and complex software which capture large amount of data that often proves difficult to interpret for clinical staff trying to gain insight into the patient's condition. Automation and simplification of the analysis of gait data is therefore necessary if it is to be used more productively. This research proposes a simple and cost effective approach that utilizes artificial intelligence techniques to automate the analysis and diagnosis processes. It also offers a means to compare different treatment methods and their effectiveness during the course of treatment.

The approach involves the use of syntactic pattern recognition concepts from the field of artificial intelligence (AI). It is based on methods of strings matching and clustering, applied extensively in genetics, molecular chemistry and biological sciences. The CF strategy followed implies clustering character strings that denote machine sequences in process routings. Numerical quantification of dissimilarity between part routings by a specific distance measure and the concept of average linkage clustering algorithm (ALCA) are at the core of the clustering procedure. The use of the approach is studied numerically with regard to a real industrial case and diverse layouts of cellular system are considered, including those with machine sharing.

Teammates independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of hundreds and sometimes thousands of citations during an initial screening phase. We investigated whether supervised machine learning methods can potentially reduce their workload. We also extended earlier research by including observational studies of a rare condition. To build training and test sets, we used annotated citations from a search conducted for an in-progress Cochrane systematic review. We extracted features from titles, abstracts, and metadata, then trained, optimized, and tested several classifiers with respect to mean performance based on 10-fold cross-validations. In the training condition, the evolutionary support vector machine (EvoSVM) with an Epanechnikov or radial kernel is the best classifier: mean recall=100%; mean precision=48% and 41%, respectively. In the test condition, EvoSVM performance degrades: mean recall=77%, mean precision ranges from 26% to 37%.

Pharmacovigilance is mainly based on spontaneous reports: when suspecting an adverse drug reaction, health care practitioners send a report to a spontaneous reporting system (SRS). This produces huge databases containing numerous reports and their manual exploration is both cost and time prohibitive. Existing techniques that automatically extract relevant signals rely on statistics or Bayesian models but do not provide information to the experts about possible biases lying in the data, nor about the specificity of a signal to a particular patient profile. Our extraction method combines numerical methods from the state of the art with a qualitative approach that helps interpretation.

Typical questions that are important in understanding the displacement of crime are: When do hot spots of high crime rates emerge? Where do they emerge? And, perhaps most importantly, how can they be prevented? In this paper, an agent-based simulation model of crime displacement is presented, which can be used not only to simulate the spatio-temporal dynamics of crime, but also to analyze and control those dynamics. To this end, methods from Artificial Intelligence and Ambience Intelligence are used, which are aimed at developing intelligent systems that monitor human-related processes, and provide appropriate support. More specifically, an explicit domain model of crime displacement has been developed, and, on top of that, model-based reasoning techniques are applied to the domain model, in order to analyze which environmental circumstances result in which crime rates, and to determine which support measures are most appropriate. The model can be used as an analytical tool for researchers and policy makers to perform thought experiments, i.e., to shed more light on the process under investigation, and possibly improve existing policies (e.g., for surveillance). The basic concepts of the model are defined in such a way that it can be directly connected to empirical information.;;;;;Gerritsen, Charlotte/0000-0002-5911-6353;;;;;;;;;;;;1860-949X;;978-3-642-15222-1;;;;2010;314;;;;;;159;177;;;;;;;;;WOS:000288934900008;;;;;;

Although he does not tell us where he took his patterns from, it is possible to infer that they are the result of his sensible observation of existing situations in European cities. However, these solutions are not necessarily true for situations in other countries, with different climates, economies and societies. The Brazilian landscape designer Roberto Bur le Marx is considered to have achieved the highest level of excellence and success in his designs for private gardens and public open spaces. In other words, there is no doubt about his being considered a specialist, in the AI (artificial Intelligence) sense, in his field.

The cognitive sciences, spanning neurology, psychology, and computational intelligence, offer substantial advances in understanding the origins and purposes of morality. Meanwhile, world events urge the timely synthesis of these insights with traditional accounts that can be easily assimilated and practically employed to augment moral judgment, both to solve current problems and to direct future action. The object of the following paper is to present such a synthesis in the form of a model of moral cognition, the ACTWith model of conscience. The purpose of the model is twofold. One, the ACTWith model is intended to shed light on personal moral dispositions, and to provide a tool for actual human moral agents in the refinement of their moral lives. As such, it relies on the power of personal introspection, bolstered by the careful study of moral exemplars available to all persons in all cultures in the form of literary or religious figures, if not in the form of contemporary peers and especially leadership. Two, the ACTWith model is intended as a minimum architecture for fully functional artificial morality. As such, it is essentially amodal, implementation non-specific and is developed in the form of an information processing control system. There are given as few hard points in this system as necessary for moral function, and these are themselves taken from review of actual human cognitive processes, thereby intentionally capturing as closely as possible what is expected of moral action and reaction by human beings. Only in satisfying these untutored intuitions should an artificial agent ever be properly regarded as moral, at least in the general population of existing moral agents. Thus, the ACTWith model is intended as a guide both for individual moral development and for the development of artificial moral agents as future technology permits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1860-949X;;978-3-642-15222-1;;;;2010;314;;;;;;607;621;;;;;;;;;WOS:000288934900034;;;;;;

Application of information methods manifests itself by the fact that in computer science it is possible to automate requirements of standards, the defined domains of which are very wide. For example, in metal works only the welding parameters such as welds, their fulfillment technology, marking, etc. are very expanded, therefore their application is labour-intensive. The automation of these requirements is of topical interest as it would allow to avoid inaccuracies in both designing a construction and managing the carried out drawing. On the other hand, information methods enable to save sheet information automatically if a drawing is made without usual simplifications used in visualizing of drawings by pencil methods (breaks, simplified markings, etc.). All this requires some new work methods which are examined in the paper solving management problems which arise at the boundary of traditional (pencil) and computer (information) technologies while applying intelligence potentialities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-9955-28-594-6;;;;2010;;;;;;;576;580;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392562400002;;;;;;

Their dimensions and shapes are known, therefore, the process can be formalized. This enables automation of many actions, as well as direct data transfer from a standard or catalogue into commands, which can be used in the process of project development and control. However, the existing standards of ferroconcrete reinforcement are presented in an unstructured form and cannot be used directly in computer science. The rational computer-aided application could be provided only on condition that the data would be structured and formalized in advance, which enables transformation of textual recommendations into digital models and commands. The paper addresses the problem of modelling of this process, which could enable the application of information technologies to using the data of the standards based on the abilities provided by computer intelligence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-9955-28-594-6;;;;2010;;;;;;;581;586;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392562400003;;;;;;

The advantage of using formal modeling techniques over simulation tools is that the user can do both performance evaluation and model verification. One of these methods is Petri Nets. A Petri Net is a mathematical and graphical tool, invented by Carl Adam Petri, used to verify systems and protocols. Petri Nets have been used to analyze and verify systems in different areas of computer science such as parallel processing, distributed systems and computer networks, artificial intelligence ... etc. In this paper, we use the Colored Petri Nets (CPN), an extension for Petri Nets, to model and evaluate the performance of our EQ-MAC protocol [I]. EQ-MAC is quality of service and energy aware hybrid MAC protocol specifically designed for wireless sensor networks. After developing the Petri models for the EQ-MAC protocol, the GreatSPN software system is used to validate the correctness of the developed models and evaluate the performance. Two important performance measures are defined, which are average delay and packets delivery ratio; The results demonstrate the efficiency of our protocol.

Optimization of mechatronic system control is provided by minimization of electric energy consumption and maximization of passengers' comfort level. We propose to solve this task using artificial intelligence and progressive multiple criteria decision making methods. The popular Nelder-Mead multiple criteria decision making method (Nelder and Mead 1965) is applied. This method makes it possible to find a minimal value for the target function. In this case there is a dependence of minimal electric energy consumption on maximal comfort level. Our modelling and investigation is based on a typical architecture of heating ventilation and air conditioning system with a traditional application of AC induction motors for driving both a compressor and a fan of the conditioner. Special interest and further development is devoted to intelligent heating systems, allowing more flexible regulation of the system's compressor and fan operation, and, therefore, improvement of efficiency and energy saving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0075-8442;;"978-3-642-04045-0; 978-3-642-04044-3";;;;2010;634;;;;;;27;34;;10.1007/978-3-642-04045-0_3;;;;;;;WOS:000300517300003;;;;;;

Started with some literature of a previous developed chatbot, then a detailed description of each new enhanced algorithm together with testing and results from the implementation of these new algorithms that can be used in development of a modern chatbot. These several new algorithms will enable features that will extend chatbot capabilities in responding to the conversation.

In QMKP, profit values are associated not only with individual objects but also with pairs of objects. Profit value associated with a pair of objects is added to the total profit if both objects of the pair belong to the same knapsack. The objective of this problem is to assign each object to at most one knapsack in such a way that the total weight of the objects in each knapsack should not exceed knapsack's capacity and the total profit of all the objects included into the knapsacks is maximized. We have compared our approach with three genetic algorithms and a stochastic hill climber.

They address most of the classical data mining problems such as classification, clustering or pattern mining. However, providing classical solutions for classical problems is not always sufficient. This is especially true for pattern mining problems known to be representable as set, an important class of problems which have many applications such as in data mining, in databases, in artificial intelligence, or in software engineering. A common idea is to say that solutions devised so far for classical pattern mining problems, such as frequent itemset mining, should be useful to answer these tasks. Unfortunately, it seems rather optimistic to envision the application of most of publicly available tools even for closely related problems. In this context, the main contribution of this paper is to propose a modular and efficient tool in which users can easily adapt and control several pattern mining algorithms. From a theoretical point of view, this work takes advantage of the common theoretical background of pattern mining problems isomorphic to boolean lattices. This tool, a C++ library called iZi, has been devised and applied to several problems such as itemset mining, constraint mining in relational databases, and query rewriting in data integration systems. According to our first results, the programs obtained using the library have very interesting performance characteristics regarding simplicity of their development. The library is open source and freely available on the Web.;;;;Flouvat, Frederic/V-9219-2019;Flouvat, Frederic/0000-0001-7288-0498;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-14639-8;;;;2010;5669;;;;;;1;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000286775600001;;;;;;

Application of computational intelligence methods helps medical doctors to process data faster, and give better, more reliable diagnoses. In dermatology computer analysis is getting more important every year. Differentiation of malignant melanoma images requires very fast image processing and feature extraction/classification algorithms. Applying artificial intelligence algorithms to explore and search large database of dermatoscopic images allows doctors to semantically filter out images with specified characteristics. This paper describes a decision-support system which is based on semantic analysis of melanoma images and further classification of characteristic objects commonly found in pigmented skin lesions.

The lack of early diagnosis has provided reactive and late measures, only when the professional suffering psychological disorder is already showing signs of incapacity for working and social relationships.

The method allows gradual, step-by-step training, starting with end-game positions and gradually moving towards the root of the game tree. In each phase a new training set is generated basing on results of previous training stages and any supervised learning method can be used for actual development of the evaluation function. We validate the usefulness of the approach by employing it to develop heuristics for the game of checkers. Since in previous experiments we applied it to training evaluation functions encoded as linear combinations of game state statistics, this time we concentrate on development of artificial neural network (ANN)-based heuristics.;;;;;Mandziuk, Jacek/0000-0003-0947-028X;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-15870-4;;;;2010;6239;;II;;;;543;552;;;;;;;;;WOS:000286453000055;;;;;;

The major contribution of this paper is a utility - EvoPerf - which has the ability to autonomously monitor different system-wide parameters, requiring no user intervention, to accurately identify performance based anomalies (or bottlenecks). EvoPerf uses Windows Perfmon utility to collect a number of performance counters from the kernel of Windows OS. Subsequently, we show that artificial intelligence based techniques - using performance counters - can be used successfully to design an accurate and efficient performance monitoring utility. We evaluate feasibility of six classifiers - UCS, GAssist-ADI, GAssist-Int, NN-MLP, NN-RBF and J48 - and conclude that all classifiers provide more than 99% classification accuracy with less than 1% false positives. However, the processing overhead of J48 and neural networks based classifiers is significantly smaller compared with evolutionary classifiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-15843-8;;;;2010;6238;;I;;;;304;313;;;;;;;;;WOS:000286565200031;;;;;;

A key feature of Go is that humans begin to learn on a small board, and then incrementally learn advanced strategies on larger boards. While some machine learning methods can also scale the board, they generally only focus on a subset of the board at one time. Neuroevolution algorithms particularly struggle with scalable Go because they are often directly encoded (i.e. a single gene maps to a single connection in the network). Thus this paper applies an indirect encoding to the problem of scalable Go that can evolve a solution to 5 x 5 Go and then extrapolate that solution to 7 x 7 Go and continue evolution. The scalable method is demonstrated to learn faster and ultimately discover better strategies than the same method trained on 7 x 7 Go directly from the start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-15843-8;;;;2010;6238;;I;;;;354;363;;;;;;;;;WOS:000286565200036;;;;;;

This periodic electromagnetic potential results in creation of energy bandgaps where photon propagation is prohibited. PhC structures have promising use in thermal applications if optimized to operate at specific thermal emission spectrum. Here, novel utilization of optimized PhC's in thermal applications is presented. We demonstrate through numerical simulation the modification of the thermal emission spectrum by a metallic photonic crystal (PhC) to create high-efficiency multispectral thermal emitters. These emitters funnel radiation from a broad emission spectrum associated with a Planck-like distribution into a prescribed narrow emission band. A detailed quantitative evaluation of the spectral and power efficiencies of a PhC thermal emitter and its portability across infrared (IR) spectral bands are provided. We show an optimized tungsten PhC with a predominant narrow-band emission profile with an emitter efficiency that is more than double that of an ideal blackbody and similar to 65-75% more power-efficiency across the IR spectrum. We also report on using optimal three-dimensional Lincoln log photonic crystal (LL-PhC) emitters for thermophotovoltaic (TPV) generation as opposed to using a passive filtering approach to truncate the broadband thermal source emission to match the bandgap of a photovoltaic (PV) cell. The emitter performance is optimized for the 1-2 mu m PV band using different PhC materials, specifically copper, silver and gold. The use of the proposed PhC in TPV devices can produce significant energy savings not reported before. The optimal design of the PhC geometry is obtained by implementing a variety of optimization methods integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.;;;;El-Kady, Ihab/D-2886-2013;"El-Kady, Ihab/0000-0001-7417-9814; Reda Taha, Mahmoud M./0000-0002-3707-9336";;;;;;;;;;;;0277-786X;1996-756X;978-0-8194-8005-7;;;;2010;7609;;;;;;;;76090V;10.1117/12.849045;;;;;;;WOS:000283790200013;;;;;;

Electronics and telecommunications (ET) includes or is combined with other branches like: microelectronics, radioelectronics, optoelectronics, photonics, acoustoelectronics, magnetronics, bioelectronics, energoelectronics, material engineering, semiconductor physics, automation and robotics, mechatronics and microsystems, informatics, teleinformatics, software engineering and other. Devices and functional systems of ET such as computers, data warehouses, cell phones, TV sets, Internet, GPS are build of electronic components and circuits. ET is a branch which belongs to hi-tech area, where the products gather a large load of knowledge of value overcoming frequently the price of work and material. ET has recently turned to an active participant of the processes of generation, storing, processing, transportation, distribution and usage of knowledge in the society. ET started to create artificial intelligence, co-creates intellectual property, searches for knowledge in big data sets, aids medicine, extends virtual/augmented reality, builds Internet of persons and things, strengthens security, protects natural environment, facilitates our life, aids our decisions, activates individuals, equalizes chances, provides convenient personal communications and access to data, starts building a penetrating ubiquitous infrastructure, ceases to be only a branch of technology, grows into the social space, touches culture, sociology, psychology and art. Such an important role of ET is combined with the existence in the society of an adequate infrastructure which recreates the full development cycle of high technology embracing: people, institutions, finances and logistics, in this also science, higher education, education, continuous training, dissemination and outreach, professional social environment, legal basis, political support and lobbying, innovation structures, applications, industry and economy. The digest of chosen development tendencies in ET was made here from the academic perspective, in a wider scale and on this background the national one, trying to situate this branch in the society, determine its changing role to build a new technical infrastructure of a society based on knowledge, a role of builder of many practical gadgets facilitating life, a role of a big future integrator of today's single bricks into certain more useful unity. This digest does not have a character of a systematic analysis of ET. It is a kind of an arbitrary utterance of the authors inside their field of competence. The aim of this paper is to take an active part in the discussion of the academic community in this country on the development strategy of ET, choice of priorities for cyclically rebuilding economy, in competitive environments. The review paper was initiated by the Committee of Electronics and Telecommunications of Polish Academy of Sciences and was published in Polish as introductory chapter of a dedicated expertise, printed in a book format. This version makes the included opinions available for a wider community.;;;;Romaniuk, Ryszard S/B-9140-2011;"Romaniuk, Ryszard S/0000-0002-5710-4041; Modelski, Jozef/0000-0001-8533-1834";;;;;;;;;;;;0277-786X;;978-0-8194-8235-8;;;;2010;7745;;;;;;;;774505;10.1117/12.871183;;;;;;;WOS:000291389700004;;;;;;

Because of the characteristics: partly depending the primary estimation and having the global convergence, it can be used to solve different complex applications, such as the optimal design of projects, artificial intelligence,strategic system, geo-physical inversion and so on. Although the genetic algorithm is an efficient global-optimization method, from the simulation results the defaults of time-consuming and vain local-researching ability can be detected. But the conjugate gradient algorithm belongs to a non-heuristic global-optimization search method, with the characteristics of swift convergence, easily dumping into local extreme value and severely depending on the primary estimation. This essay adopts a hybrid genetic algorithm of geo-physical inversion, according to the properties of the genetic algorithm and the conjugate gradient algorithm. The method has the attributes of the global-convergence of the genetic algorithm and the swift convergence of the conjugate gradient. Finally in accordance with procedures to test simulation algorithm and analysis with examples to prove that the procedure has good practicability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1559-9450;;978-1-934142-12-7;;;;2010;;;;;;;221;224;;;;;;;;;WOS:000305504900047;;;;;;

For instance, Einstein's famous 1905 paper (On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies) uses symmetry to help derive the laws of special relativity. In artificial intelligence, symmetry has played an important role in both problem representation and reasoning. I describe recent work on using symmetry to help solve constraint satisfaction problems. Symmetries occur within individual solutions of problems as well as between different solutions of the same problem. Symmetry can also be applied to the constraints in a problem to give new symmetric constraints. Reasoning about symmetry can speed up problem solving, and has led to the discovery of new results in both graph and number theory.;;;;Walsh, Toby/Q-9043-2016;Walsh, Toby/0000-0003-2998-8668;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-15245-0;;;;2010;6230;;;;;;11;13;;;;;;;;;WOS:000286842600004;;;;;;

Considerable effort has been made in identifying properties which ensure tractability in such problems. In this paper we study hybrid tractability of soft constraint problems; that is, properties which guarantee tractability of the given soft constraint problem, but properties which do not depend only on the underlying structure of the instance (such as being tree-structured) or only on the types of soft constraints in the instance (such as subrnodularity). We firstly present two hybrid classes of soft constraint problems defined by forbidden subgraphs in the structure of the instance. These classes allow certain combinations of binary crisp constraints together with arbitrary unary soft constraints. We then introduce the joint-winner property, which allows us to define a novel hybrid tractable class of soft constraint problems with soft binary and unary constraints. This class generalises the SOFTALLDIFF constraint with arbitrary unary soft constraints. We show that the joint-winner property is easily recognisable in polynomial time and present a polynomial-time algorithm based on maximum-flows for the class of soft constraint problems satisfying the joint-winner property. Moreover, we show that if cost functions can only take on two distinct values then this class is maximal.";;;;Cooper, Martin/AAE-8777-2020;Cooper, Martin/0000-0003-4853-053X;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-15395-2;;;;2010;6308;;;;;;152;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000286485800015;;;;;;

This paper proposes a novel distributed service discovery algorithm in pervasive computing environments. This method is based on the basic principle of social network and bio-inspired intelligence. It exploits a social behavior and ant inspired query routing mechanism, which views query messages as artificial ants, and utilizes pheromone and social utility as routing hints that direct query messages to nodes owning more services. This paper presents generation and update rule of pheromone, routing policy for artificial ants as well. In order to avoid getting into local optimization, the roulette wheel technique and pheromone limitation policy are used in our algorithm.

This software offers the possibility to control the learning method's parameters throughout the learning process, which allows observing the effects of such parameters on a real robot. Furthermore, learning on the hardware robot is very fast since forward-walking policies are usually learned in about 30 seconds. Due to this quick learning process nearly no waiting tune is caused, and in return this fact often impresses the audience and leads to the question: How does it work?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-80-227-3353-3;;;;2010;;;;;;;171;176;;;;;;;;;WOS:000396075300033;;;;;;

This stage is important for tumour classification and quantification in medical volumes particularly in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Analysing PET volumes at early stage of illness is important for radiotherapy planning, tumour diagnosis, and fast recovery. There are many techniques for segmenting medical volumes, in which some of the approaches have poor accuracy and require a lot of time for analysing large medical volumes. In this paper, a novel hybrid approach (HA) combining artificial neural network (ANN) with multiresolution analysis (MRA) for segmenting oncological PET data aiming at providing an accurate quantitative analysis tool is proposed. Proposing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can provide better accuracy and save decent amount of time. The proposed approach has been evaluated against other medical volume segmentation techniques such as thresholding, clustering, and multiscale Markov random field model. The proposed approach has shown promising results in terms of the detection and quantification of the region of interest (ROI) and tumour, in phantom and clinical PET volumes respectively.;;;;Zaidi, Habib/I-4669-2017;Zaidi, Habib/0000-0001-7559-5297;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4244-7456-1;;;;2010;;;;;;;596;599;;;;;;;;;WOS:000296009300151;;;;;;

In 2002, a new standard named National Student Physical Health Standard (PHS) began to be carried out year by year. Therefore, a great deal of test data is recorded. Although sports data analysis became more and more technical with the development of artificial intelligence and data analysis technologies, studies on these records were still limited to basic statistics analysis in the past. In this paper a new technology named Data Mining which can find unknown patterns of certain data sets and relationships among the data is introduced to analyze PHS test data. We attempt to apply various data mining algorithms in PHS data analysis with the help of Microsoft SQL Server 2005. First, decision tree and naive bayes algorithms are applied to analysis the dependency between single test and score level. Second, association rules algorithm is used to explore detailed associations between single test and score level. Finally, classifying performance of naive bayes, decision tree and clustering algorithms are compared. Some valuable conclusions are achieved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-84626-059-9;;;;2010;;;;;;;343;346;;;;;;;;;WOS:000288182600082;;;;;;

Reactive behaviour is still considered as the exact opposite for the anticipatory one. It was shown that reactive and anticipatory behaviour can be combined. We will present own viewpoint. Our multi-level anticipatory behaviour approach is based on the current understanding of anticipation from both the artificial intelligence and the biology point of view. The terms as weak and strong artificial life will be discussed here. Original thought is that we use not one but multiple levels of anticipation in a creature design. We focus on the first 2 levels within the 8-factor anticipation framework here. These first two levels may seem trivial, but growing interest in implicit anticipation and reactive anticipation suggest that this is a worthwhile topic. The simplicity of them is intentional to demonstrate our way of thinking and understanding of the topic. The comparison with other results is possible only when these levels are integrated into the complex architecture that can also act as standalone.

In particular, we are interested in a specific set of postures which are representative of typical applications found in video analytics. The algorithms chosen for this paper are K-means, artificial neural network, self organizing maps and particle swarm optimization.

In order to increase the accuracy of management evaluations for individual members and teams' efficiency over time and take rapid decisions during key company restructuring processes, we propose a new approach that combines techniques from multiple research domains such as artificial intelligence, fuzzy systems, data clustering and multi-agent systems (MAS). The system performs a social network analysis within the organisation using Fuzzy System Modelling (FSM) and Dempster-Shafer belief and reasoning models, providing the organisation's management with a more realistic view over the actual interactions between different individual members and teams as opposed to the somewhat fixed team structure. A system design is proposed, along with the main components and interactions: knowledge database, social networking, decisional MAS and organisational workflow management software. The impact of social interactions on individual and group performance is studied to determine actual stakeholders (super-stakeholders) and influence patterns within the teams. We therefore introduce two distinct notions for individuals and group cohesion: real influence spheres which resemble actual team structure and virtual influence which are determined through interactions between individuals, independent of the team structure. These spheres will be included in the decisional MAS as agents which monitor the progress of each member within their reach and help with management decisions, providing them with constant feedback. We then study how virtual influence spheres interact with the real influence spheres and how we can determine the influence of multiple super-stakeholders over the same group of people. The results of these analyses, along with the skill set and performance ratings which are given by the organisation's management are used to determine how changes in team structure could improve an individual's efficiency over time. Conclusions are drawn over the possible uses of this system in actual organisations, along with a discussion over possible directions towards extending the proposed multi-agent system.;;;;"Zaharia, Mihai Horia/ABC-4088-2020; Zaharia, MIhai Horia/R-3288-2019";"Zaharia, Mihai Horia/0000-0002-7091-1358; ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-906638-59-7;;;;2010;;;;;;;100;106;;;;;;;;;WOS:000280731900011;;;;;;

Mobility has always been an integral part of the human condition. The acceleration of globalization associated with technological advances in the early twenty-first centuries has created a new set of parameters for understanding mobility. There is a growing population of workers, from defence force and diplomatic service personnel, business and information technology specialists to educational and health professionals. There is also an increased educational mobility, with initiatives designed to enhance opportunities for learning in multiple countries and an increased student body in international schools around the world. These new manifestations of mobility make it both timely and significant to focus attention on the multidimensional phenomenon of mobile development. Mobile learning implies learner's mobility, in the sense that learners should be able to engage in educational activities without the constraints of a tightly delimited physical location. The learning actors have begun to consider the adoption of mobile technologies in higher and further education, in schools and the community, and in training and updating. Mobile technologies are having an impact on teaching, learning, and on the connections between formal and informal learning, work and leisure. They are extremely interesting for educators due to the low cost of many of many of the mobile devices relative to desktop computers and the spontaneous and personal access they give to the vast educational resources of the Internet. When combined with wireless connectivity, learning activities can be monitored and coordinated between locations. However, the task of designing such activities and appropriate learner support is complex and challenging. This paper explores the development settings of a mobile web application, in terms of functionalities, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability and portability, based on a mobile knowledge management system that fosters a framework of practice for teachers and students that would like to integrate smart mobile technologies in their course environment. This paper corresponds to the development stage of the researches concluded within the MOBNET-Learning Project, developed in partnership by Carol I National Defence University in Bucharest, Advanced Technology Systems in Targoviste, the Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence of the Romanian Academy and two other private companies. This Project elaborates a smart access to content and knowledge in mobile settings.

It outlines possible uses of Expert Systems as diagnostic tools for evaluating faults in sports movements (techniques) and presents some example knowledge rules for such an expert system. It then compares the analysis of sports techniques, in which Expert Systems have found little place to date, with gait analysis, in which they are routinely used. Consideration is then given to the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in sports biomechanics, focusing on Kohonen self-organizing maps, which have been the most widely used in technique analysis, and multi-layer networks, which have been far more widely used in biomechanics in general. Examples of the use of ANNs in sports biomechanics are presented for javelin and discus throwing, shot putting and football kicking. I also present an example of the use of Evolutionary Computation in movement optimization in the soccer throw in, which predicted an optimal technique close to that in the coaching literature.

It is a fact that developing and implementing intelligent and informational technology represents a new approach in what the improvement of sportive outcomes are concerned, which leads to a dynamic result of a controlled and optimized training process. The level determination of sportsmen's space orientation depending on the motric prevalence forms an important aspect in sport practice and an essential element in selecting the various sportive disciplines. We consider that software usage will increase the improvement of precision in order to determine the level of space orientation according to the manual laterality of sportsmen. When the technical expression possibilities have no limits and the competitional requirements are increasingly higher, we consider that the education of space orientation may constitute an important element in increasing the efficiency of game actions, in creating an advantage in sports disputes and this is the reason for which we do not agree with the opinions expressed by some researchers who consider that ambidextry should be combated. The modern, advanced game is carried out in full speed, constant rhythm, which supposes some considerable physical effort. Besides the execution speed, the force, the coordination, the general mobility and the gracefulness necessary for executing the most complex and varied movements, it is also necessary to cultivate the space orientation, the sense of the ball, the rhythm, the equilibrium and implicitly the movement by learning as many technical-tactical actions as possible, which involve safety in catching the ball, accuracy in passing and finishing actions, etc.;;;;"Adela, Badau/C-3886-2011; Badau, Dana/C-5357-2015; Talaghir, Laurentiu-Gabriel/Z-2517-2019; NEAGU, Nicolae/J-2493-2015; Talaghir, Laurentiu-Gabriel/N-8342-2017";"Badau, Dana/0000-0002-1881-3531; Talaghir, Laurentiu-Gabriel/0000-0002-3133-9192; NEAGU, Nicolae/0000-0001-6039-8346; Talaghir, Laurentiu-Gabriel/0000-0002-3133-9192";;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-960-474-154-0;;;;2010;;;;;;;108;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000276785100017;;;;;;

We argue that bioinformatics has undergone a historical transition from the first phase to the second, now underway. The first phase was dominated by the use of traditional, intelligence-free computer programs such as database management systems, on the one hand, and by a small fraction of computational statistics, on the other hand.

Regarding the optimization procedure, saturation level of hydration, length and thickness of the beam, and applied voltage are considered as design variables. The robust and novel methods of continuous ant colony optimization (ACO(R)) and artificial bee colony (ABC), both inspired from collective behavior of ant and bee swarms, are here employed to guarantee finding near-optimal solutions in a continuous nonlinear constrained optimization schedule. Results obtained from several independent runs clearly demonstrate fast convergence with nearly identical results for both methods, conservatively claimed as global optima. In addition, it is shown that the multi-objective approach has ended in a reasonable reduction of tip deflection for a remarkable increase in blocking force.;;;;Yousefi-Koma, Aghil/T-8548-2017;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-0-7918-4915-6;;;;2010;;;;;;;559;566;;;;;;;;;WOS:000291013100070;;;;;;

This methodology can be used for various appliances and for generalizaion process. The comparison in time of processing for classical analyses and AI analyses differs, depending on the type of computational hardware used for analyze. Generally it could be said that AI solution is time less time-consuming than the standard algorithmic and propose results in quasi real time without need of signal preprocessing. As an experimental solution, this proposes future trends in vision signal processing where the classical methods are replaced by the artificial intelligence, which is not always the correct direction, but as we can see in this method possible.;;;;Magdolen, Lubos/AAD-9053-2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-0-7918-4917-0;;;;2010;;;;;;;885;889;;;;;;;;;WOS:000290971700106;;;;;;

The technique allows a novice engineer or designer to use natural language to specify components envisioned within a product. Form follows form then develops the underlying functional structure by leveraging a repository of over 5500 artifacts. Existing computational conceptual design methods are then employed to automatically display a set of ranked concept alternatives to the user. Users can quickly create a functional model by specifying input components and answering questions regarding the intent of the product. In this paper we demonstrate the capabilities of the Form Follows Form method through a case study involving the redesign of a standard household fan. Through the case study it is shown that FFF is capable of suggesting creative alternatives for existing products.

They produce, they transport. Machines facilitate work and assist. The increasing penetration of mechanical engineering by information technology enables considerable benefits. This circumstance is expressed by the term mechatronics, which means the close interaction of mechanics, electronics, control engineering and software engineering to improve the behavior of a technical system. The progressive integration of information technology will enable mechatronic systems with partial intelligence. We refer to such systems as self-optimizing systems. Self-optimizing systems have the ability to react autonomously and flexibly on changing operation conditions. The design of such systems is an even more interdisciplinary task than the design of conventional mechatronic systems. Additionally to mechanical, electrical, control and software engineers also experts from mathematical optimization and artificial intelligence are involved. As a consequence a domain-spanning methodology is necessary in order to guarantee an effective work flow between the participating developers from various domains and their domain-specific methods, terminologies and solutions. This contribution presents such a methodology. The main focus, however, lies on harnessing of experimental knowledge for the development of self-optimizing systems. This includes the generation and storage of once proven design solutions as well as a tool for the effective and domain-spanning reuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-0-7918-4411-3;;;;2010;;;;;;;1149;1158;;;;;;;;;WOS:000320569900119;;;;;;

One of the main problems to be solved if robots are to become flexible enough for various manufacturing needs is that of end-user programming. An end-user with little or no technical expertise in robotics area needs to be able to efficiently communicate its manufacturing task to the robot. This paper proposes a new method for robot task planning using some concepts of Artificial Intelligence. Our method is based on a hierarchical knowledge representation and propositional logic, which allows an expert user to incrementally integrate process and geometric parameters with the robot commands. The objective is to provide an intelligent and programmable agent such as a robot with a knowledge base about the attributes of human behaviors in order to facilitate the commanding process. The focus of this work is on robot programming for manufacturing applications. Industrial manipulators work with low level programming languages. This work presents a new method based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) that allows a user to generate robot programs using natural language lexicon and task information. This will enable a manufacturing operator (for example for painting) who may be unfamiliar with robot programming to easily employ the agent for the manufacturing tasks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-0-7918-4411-3;;;;2010;;;;;;;1309;1316;;;;;;;;;WOS:000320569900133;;;;;;

The research motivation and research goal were introduced in [1]. In order to report a progress of this project, this paper contains advanced framework and simulation results. When we did experiments using real bio-insects, their movement showed a little randomness. For this reason, fuzzy logic is employed to drive the model-free bio-insect towards a desired point. The framework formulated in this paper is based on fuzzy reward system and fuzzy expertise measurement system. Fuzzy reward system uses three inputs and an output resulting in numerical value within -1 to 1. Fuzzy expertise measurement system is inspired by area of expertise. In area of expertise method, it uses expertise measurement equation for finding expert agent. Based on area of expertise method, our method uses three expertise measurements to calculate score of individual agent. Based on this score, agents can share their intelligences with weighted scores.

Several authors have described this phase of Engineering Design. The Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) is one of these models. This study is based on the combined use of a modified version of Gero's FBS model and the latest developments of modeling languages for systems engineering. System Modeling Language (SysML) is a general-purpose graphical modeling language for specifying, analyzing, designing, and verifying complex systems. Our development shows how SysML types of diagrams match with our updated vision of the FBS model of conceptual design. The objective of this paper is to present the possibility to use artificial intelligence tools as members of the design team for supporting the synthesis process. The common point of expert systems developed during last decades for the synthesis of conceptual solutions is that their knowledge bases were application dependent. Latest research in the field of Ontology showed the possibility to build knowledge representations in a reusable and shareable manner This allows the construction of knowledge representation for engineering in a more generic manner and dynamic mapping of the ontology layers.

This paper describes an effort towards developing a railroad-specific cognitive radio (Rail-CR) that can meet the needs of future wireless communication systems for railways by making positive train control (PTC) communication more interoperable, robust, reliable, and spectrally efficient, and less costly to deploy and maintain. Cognitive radios are a cutting edge research area that combines artificial intelligence (AI) with Software Defined Radios (SDRs) with the goal of improving upon existing radio performance. SDRs are radios in which capabilities are flexible due to realizing some functionality in software as opposed to a purely hardware platform. By utilizing situational awareness from the radio in the form of observable parameters, often known as 'meters', a cognitive engine (CE) utilizes software-based decision-making algorithms to determine if a change in the radio parameters, commonly referred to as 'knobs', is required based on sets of predefined goals. Additionally, learning algorithms dovetail with the decision making to enable the system to track and utilize past decisions and observations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-0-7918-4906-4;;;;2010;;;;;;;467;473;;;;;;;;;WOS:000290415700056;;;;;;

A., Gosselin, S. R., Lydell, B. O. Y, Rudland, D. L., & Wikowski, G. M. Proc. ASME PVP Conf., San Antonio, TX, Paper PVP2007-26373), it was reported that the two benchmarked PFM models, PRO-LOCA and PRAISE, predicted significantly higher failure probabilities of cracking than those derived from field data in three PWR and one BWR cases by a factor ranging from 30 to 10,000. To explain the reasons for having such a large discrepancy, the authors listed ten sources of uncertainties: (1) Welding Residual Stresses. (2) Crack Initiation Predictions. (3) Crack Growth Rates. (4) Circumferential Stress Variation. (5) Operating temperatures different from design temperatures. (6) Temperature factor in actual activation energy vs. assumed. (7) Under reporting of field data due to NDE limitations. (8) Uncertainty in modeling initiation, growth, and linking of multiple cracks around the circumference of a weld. (9) Correlation of crack initiation times and growth rates. (10) Insights from NUREG/CR-6674 (2000) fatigue crack growth models using conservative inputs for cyclic strain rates and environmental parameters such as oxygen content. In this paper we design a Python-based plug-in that allows a user to address those ten sources of uncertainties. This approach is based on the statistical theory of design of experiments with a 2-level factorial design, where a small number of runs is enough to estimate the uncertainties in the predictions of PFM models due to some combination of the source uncertainties listed by Simonen et al (PVP2007-26373).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-0-7918-4369-7;;;;2010;;;;;;;1651;1693;;;;;;;;;WOS:000280407700171;;;;;;

The knowledge of impervious surfaces, especially the magnitude, location, geometry, spatial pattern of impervious surfaces and the pervious-impervious ratio, is significant to a range of issues and themes in environmental science central to global environmental change and human-environment interactions. Impervious surface data is important for urban planning and environmental and resources management. Therefore, estimation and mapping of impervious surfaces in the urban areas by using remote sensing imagery has recently attracted unprecedented attention. In this paper, various digital remote sensing approaches to extract and estimate impervious surfaces will be investigated. These approaches include pixel-based, sub-pixel based, object-oriented, and artificial neural networks. Discussions will focus on the selection of an appropriate estimation method based on remotely sensed data characteristics and the improvement of estimation and mapping accuracy. Furthermore, the impacts of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions on the estimation will be addressed.

Ontologies are often represented as XML-based documents like OWL-DL ontologies which allow for semantic consistency checking by formal description logic. Artificial intelligence provides reasoners as IT-support for consistency checking. Currently there exists no native XML database system which integrates logic reasoning for semantic consistency as addition to syntactic schema validation. The OXDBS project integrates a reasoner into a native XML database system, thus, allowing to assert consistency of ontological data at the most basic tier in an application environment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-60558-900-8;;;;2010;;;;;;;143;148;;10.1145/1866480.1866502;;;;;;;WOS:000406963500022;;;;;;

Knapsack problem is known as a NP-hard problem. This paper is an introduction to a new idea for solving one-dimentional knapsack that with defining the Weight Value Index, Sorting and Smart local search forms a new algorithm. This algorithm is mathematically formulated and has run on 5 sample problems of one-dimentional knapsack, that in most of them the result is close to the optimum. The results show that this method by comparison with the others recently published in this field, despite of its simplicity, has enough required functionality in order to get the result on the tested items.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-61208-101-4;;;;2010;;;;;;;77;80;;;;;;;;;WOS:000395113600014;;;;;;

The whole process is driven by number of image processing algorithms, medical knowledge about average perfusion values and knowledge about interpretation of visualized symptoms. The methods was implemented and tested on 75 triplets of medical images acquired from 30 different adult patients (man and woman) with suspicious of ischemia / stroke. Each triplet was consisted of perfusion CBF and CBV map and plain CT image (one of the image from perfusion treatment acquired before contrast arrival became visible). The algorithm response was compared to image description done to each case by radiologist. The hypothesis to verify was if there is any lesions in perfusion map and if the algorithm found correct position, description and prognosis for them (if the algorithm give a wrong answer for any of this condition the case was considered as error).

Modeling defines the problem, in terms of variables that can take on different values, subject to restrictions (constraints) on which combinations of variables are allowed. Solving finds values for all the variables that simultaneously satisfy all the constraints. However, the impact of constraint programming has been constrained by a lack of user-friendliness. Constraint programming has a major declarative aspect, in that a problem model can be handed off for solution to a variety of standard solving methods. These methods are embedded in algorithms, libraries, or specialized constraint programming languages. To fully exploit this declarative opportunity however, we must provide more assistance and automation in the modeling process, as well as in the design of application-specific problem solvers. Automated modelling and solving in constraint programming presents a major challenge for the artificial intelligence community. Artificial intelligence, and in particular machine learning, is a natural field in which to explore opportunities for moving more of the burden of constraint programming from the user to the machine. This paper presents technical challenges in the areas of constraint model acquisition, formulation and reformulation, synthesis of filtering algorithms for global constraints, and automated solving. We also present the metrics by which success and progress can be measured.;;;;;O'Sullivan, Barry/0000-0002-0090-2085;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-57735-463-5;;;;2010;;;;;;;1493;1497;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392059700237;;;;;;

To this end, a large number of special purpose systems and techniques have been developed for solving such constraint-based mining and learning problems. These techniques have, so far, been developed independently of the general purpose tools and principles of constraint programming known within the field of artificial intelligence. This paper shows that off-the-shelf constraint programming techniques can be applied to various pattern mining and rule learning problems (cf. also (De Raedt, Guns, and Nijssen 2008; Nijssen, Guns, and De Raedt 2009)). This does not only lead to methodologies that are more general and flexible, but also provides new insights into the underlying mining problems that allow us to improve the state-of-the- art in data mining.

The challenge is to select a finite number of boundaries for the segments so as to optimize an objective error function defined over those segments. Although this optimization problem can be solved in polynomial time, the algorithm which achieves the minimum error does not scale well, hence it is not practical for applications with massive data sets. There is considerable research with numerous approximation and heuristic algorithms. Still, none of those approaches has resolved the quality-efficiency tradeoff in a satisfactory manner. In (Halim, Karras, and Yap 2009), we obtain near linear time algorithms which achieve both the desired scalability and near-optimal quality, thus dominating earlier approaches. In this paper, we show how two ideas from artificial intelligence, an efficient local search and recombination of multiple solutions reminiscent of genetic algorithms, are combined in a novel way to obtain state of the art histogram construction algorithms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-57735-463-5;;;;2010;;;;;;;1680;1685;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392059700268;;;;;;

Human core body temperature (Tcore) is an important measure of thermal state, e.g., hypo-or hyperthermia, but is difficult to measure using non-invasive wearable sensors. We estimated parameters for a discrete KF model from data collected during several Military training events and from distance runners (n=38). Model performance was evaluated in 25 physically-active subjects who participated in various laboratory and field studies involving exercise of 2-to-8 h duration at ambient temperatures of 20 to 40 degrees C. Overall, the KF model's estimate of Tcore had a root mean square error of 0.30 +/- 0.13 degrees C from the observed Tcore, and was within +/- 0.5 degrees C over 85% of the time. The benefit of the KF approach is that it requires only one input while current state of the art models typically require multiple inputs including individual anthropometrics, metabolic rate, clothing characteristics, and environmental conditions. This state estimation problem in computational physiology illustrates the potential for collaboration between the artificial intelligence and ambulatory physiological monitoring communities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-57735-463-5;;;;2010;;;;;;;1763;1768;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392059700282;;;;;;

NASA and its partners have developed a new collaborative concept of operations that requires the users and airspace service provider to work together to choose initiatives that better satisfy the business needs of the users while also ensuring safety to the same standard as today. In this paper, we describe an approach to implementing this concept through a software negotiation framework underpinned by technology developed in the artificial intelligence community. We describe our exploration of peer-to-peer negotiation and how the number of conversation threads and the time sensitivity of offer acceptance led us to a centralized approach. The centralized approach uses hill climbing to evaluate airport slot allocations from a user perspective and a linear programming solver to seek solutions compatible across the user community.

This paper introduces an emerging application of techniques from mixed initiative (adjustable autonomy), multi-agent systems, and task scheduling techniques to the air traffic control domain. Consequently, we have created a testbed for investigating the critical challenges in supporting the early design of systems that allow for optimal, context-sensitive function (role) allocation between air traffic controller and automated agents.

In prior work, we have illustrated the potential of this approach both in providing scaffolding, building an inexpensive robotics laboratory, and also providing control of evaluation of robotics environments for student evaluation and scientific experimentation. In this paper, we explore integrating extensions and improvements to the mixed reality components themselves as part of a course in applied artificial intelligence and robotics. We present a set of assignments that in addition to exploring robotics concepts, actively integrate creating or improving mixed reality components. We find that this approach better leverages the advantages brought about by mixed reality in terms of student motivation, and also provides some very useful software engineering experience to the students.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-57735-463-5;;;;2010;;;;;;;1879;1884;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392059700300;;;;;;

There are four project topics: state-space search, multi-agent search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. Each project requires students to implement general-purpose AI algorithms and then to inject domain knowledge about the Pac-Man environment using search heuristics, evaluation functions, and feature functions. We have found that the Pac-Man theme adds consistency to the course, as well as tapping in to students' excitement about video games.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-57735-463-5;;;;2010;;;;;;;1885;1889;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392059700301;;;;;;

In this paper, we describe how to integrate this module into a machine-learning agent, SimStudent, that learns procedural knowledge from examples and through problem solving.

Good and bad secondary schools are mentioned, but the reasons why some of them are good and others are bad are not. A lot of dart will be needed to renovate secondary education where numerous problems are found: high dropout, low attendance, and lack of student and teacher motivation to participate in curricular or extracurricular activities. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the effects of student participation on the quality of schoolwork and to elaborate a method and a technique far such an evaluation. Special attention is given to student participation as a factor in school culture that differentiates between schools. The effects of student participation on the quality of the curriculum can be measured. Methods and techniques of artificial intelligence, such as the computer programmes Dexi (Jereb, E., Bohanec. M, Rajkovie, V., 2003) and Vredana (Set, A., Bohanec, M., Krisper, M., 2001) will be used to make an expert model. A survey method is used to assess different criterions of school quality.

Low power VLSI circuits dissipate more power during testing when compared with that of normal operation. As the feature size is scaled down with process technology advancement, power minimization has become a serious problem for the designers as well as the test engineers. Test vector reordering for dynamic power minimization during combinational circuit testing is a sub-problem of the general goal of low power testing. The reordering is the process in which the sequence of applying test vectors is altered to reduce power dissipation. Power dissipation in CMOS circuits has two components: static, due to leakage current; and dynamic, due to switching activity. In this project, Artificial Intelligent (AI) based approach is presented to reorder the test vectors such that the minimum switching activity and hence the power dissipation during testing. In this method the hamming distance between successive test vectors is used to reorder the sequence. AI based reordering algorithm is implemented in Matlab and experimented with ISCAS85 benchmark circuits. Results show that the reordered test set minimized the testing power considerably when compared with unordered test set. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces 30.15% of average power and 34.56% of the peak power when the reordered test vectors are used for testing.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1792-4308;;978-960-474-162-5;;;;2010;;;;;;;113;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000276884600020;;;;;;

Agricultural production has to keep up with an ever-increasing population by taking advantage of a field's heterogeneity. Nowadays, modern technology such as the global positioning system (GPS) and a multitude of developed sensors enable farmers to better measure their fields' heterogeneities. For this small-scale, precise treatment the term precision agriculture has been coined. However, the large amounts of data that are (literally) harvested during the growing season have to be analysed. In particular, the farmer is interested in knowing whether a newly developed heterogeneity sensor is potentially advantageous or not. Since the sensor data are readily available, this issue should be seen from an artificial intelligence perspective. There it can be treated as a feature selection problem. The additional task of yield prediction can be treated as a multi-dimensional regression problem.

Wavelet transforms and pattern classification techniques are implemented in artificial intelligence routines that can automatically detect pocket depth. The main pattern classification technique used here, called a binary classification algorithm, compares test objects with only two possible pocket depth measurements at a time and relies on dimensionality reduction for the final determination.

An ITS is a computer-based programme for teaching and learning and aims to facilitate personalized learning processes. The label of 'intelligent' is associated with the system's capacity to analyse the grammar of the language entry and then generate the appropriate feedback according to the student's error. To do this, it is necessary to use natural language processing techniques based on grammar-related theories so that the student's entry can be processed to generate a specific feedback strategy. The interest in learning Spanish as a Foreign Language has increased over the years, and this has resulted in the elaboration of learning environments highly improved by professionals and researchers that effectively support the processes to foster student learning autonomy. As to foreign language learning, the interest that students have in the incorporation of e-learning platforms empowered with Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) has been empirically proven. However, the limitations of such platforms have also been observed regarding the processing of linguistic forms, specifically in terms of recognizing the different language errors that students make (grammar, lexicon, etc.) and the precariousness and lack of effectiveness in the type of feedback used to process these errors. Corrective feedback and errors are an essential and normal part of the language learning process. The main objective of this article is to meet the need of improving the Spanish as a foreign language learning process through the design and implementation of the parser of an intelligent tutorial system that could identify and classify grammatical errors in Spanish as a foreign language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0718-0934;;;;;;2010;43;73;;;;;211;236;;10.4067/S0718-09342010000200002;;;;;;;WOS:000291371300002;;;;;;

Thus, three distinct structures are discussed, all making use of certain artificial intelligence techniques. They address the use and integration of artificial vision, a planning approach based on temporal logics, and a multi agent scheme. The three methods refer cases of mobile robots evolving in environments where various types of sensorial information can be obtained.

Many previous works have adopted bibliographic records (i.e., publications) as a source of evidence for representing the areas of expertise [1,2]. In this paper, we present an expertise mapping approach based on a probabilistic keyword annotation model constructed from bibliographic data. To build the model, we use the Science Citation Index (SCI) database as the main publication source due to its large coverage on science and technology (S&T) research areas. To represent the expertise keywords, we use the subject category field of the SCI database which provides general concepts for describing knowledge in UT such as Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Nanoscience Nanotechnology. The keyword annotation model contains a set of expertise keywords such that each is represented with a probability distribution over a set of terms appearing in titles and abstracts. Given publication records (perhaps from different sources) of an expert, a set of keywords can be automatically assigned to represent his/her area of expertise.;;;;Hunter, Jane/E-5213-2013;Hunter, Jane/0000-0002-7163-4137;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-13653-5;;;;2010;6102;;;;;;256;257;;;;;;;;;WOS:000279320900032;;;;;;

In conventional CBR, cases are represented in terms of structured attribute-value pairs. Acquisition of cases, either from domain experts or through manually crafting attribute-value pairs from incident reports, constitutes the main reason why CBR systems have not been more common in industries. Manual case generation is a laborious, costlier and time consuming task. Textual CBR (TCBR) is an emerging line that aims to apply CBR techniques on cases represented as textual descriptions. Similarity of cases is based on the similarity between their constituting features. Conventional CBR benefits from employing domain specific knowledge for similarity assessment. Correspondingly, TCBR needs to involve higher-order relationships between features, hence domain specific knowledge. In addition, the term order has also been contended to influence the similarity assessment. This paper presents an account where features and cases are represented using a distributed representation paradigm that captures higher-order relations among features as well as term order information.;;;;;Prasath, Rajendra/0000-0002-0826-847X;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-13528-6;;;;2010;6086;;;;;;740;750;;;;;;;;;WOS:000281605400078;;;;;;

Digital image processing techniques involve image classification which is a significant technique to detect the abnormality in the eye. Various automated classification systems have been developed in the recent years but most of them lack high classification accuracy. Artificial neural networks are the widely preferred artificial intelligence technique since it yields superior results in terms of classification accuracy. In this work, Radial Basis function (RBF) neural network based bi-level classification system is proposed to differentiate abnormal DR Images and normal retinal images.

Such agents may need to optimize their own performance according to multiple policies as well as contribute to the optimization of overall system performance towards a potentially different set of policies. These policies can be heterogeneous, i.e., be implemented on different sets of agents, be active at different times and have different levels of priority, leading to the heterogeneity of the agents of which the system is composed. Numerous biologically-inspired techniques as well as techniques from artificial intelligence have been used to implement such self-organizing systems. In this paper we review the most commonly used techniques for multi-policy optimization in such systems, specifically, those based on ant colony optimization, evolutionary algorithms, particle swarm optimization and reinforcement learning (RL). We analyze the characteristics and existing applications of the reviewed algorithms, assessing their suitability for particular types of optimization problems, based on the environment and policy characteristics. We focus on R,L, as it is considered particularly suitable for large-scale self-organizing systems due to its ability to take into account the long-term consequences of the actions executed. Therefore, RL enables the system to learn not only the immediate payoffs of its actions, but also the best actions for the long-term performance of the system. Existing RL implementations mostly focus on optimization towards a single system policy, while most multi-policy RL-based optimization techniques have so far been implemented only on a single agent. We argue that, in order to be more widely utilized as a technique for self-optimization, RL needs to address both multiple policies and multiple agents simultaneously, and analyze the challenges associated with extending existing or developing new RL optimization techniques.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-14411-0;;;;2010;6090;;;;;;101;126;;;;;;;;;WOS:000281987900006;;;;;;

It is an example of the more general task of composing business processes or component-based software. Our doctoral research endeavours to make fundamental contributions to the knowledge representation and reasoning principles underlying the task of WSC, with a particular focus on the customization of compositions with respect to individual preferences. The setting for our work is the semantic web, where the properties and functioning of services and data are described in a computer-interpretable form. In this setting we conceive of WSC as an Artificial Intelligence planning task. This enables us to bring to bear many of the theoretical and computational advances in reasoning about action and planning to the task of WSC. However, WSC goes far beyond the reaches of classical planning, presenting a number of interesting challenges that are relevant not only to WSC but to a large body of problems related to the composition of actions, programs, business processes, and services.

Artificial intelligence in sensor systems is a critical design to raise awareness levels, improve the performance of the system and adapt to a changing scenario and environment. In this paper, a highly-distributed, fault-tolerant, and energy-efficient Smart Sensing Surveillance System (S4) is presented to efficiently provide a 24/7 and all weather security operation in crowded environments or restricted areas. Technically, the S4 consists of a number of distributed sensor nodes integrated with specific passive sensors to rapidly collect, process, and disseminate heterogeneous sensor data from near omni-directions. These distributed sensor nodes can cooperatively work to send immediate security information when new objects appear. When the new objects are detected, the S4 will smartly select the available node with a Pan-Tilt-Zoom-(PTZ) Electro-Optics EO/IR camera to track the objects and capture associated imagery. The S4 provides applicable advanced on-board digital image processing capabilities to detect and track the specific objects. The imaging detection operations include unattended object detection, human feature and behavior detection, and configurable alert triggers, etc. Other imaging processes can be updated to meet specific requirements and operations. In the S4, all the sensor nodes are connected with a robust, reconfigurable, LPI/LPD (Low Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detect) wireless mesh network using Ultra-wide band (UWB) RF technology. This UWB RF technology can provide an ad-hoc, secure mesh network and capability to relay network information, communicate and pass situational awareness and messages. The Service Oriented Architecture of S4 enables remote applications to interact with the S4 network and use the specific presentation methods. In addition, the S4 is compliant with Open Geospatial Consortium - Sensor Web Enablement (OGC-SWE) standards to efficiently discover, access, use, and control heterogeneous sensors and their metadata. These S4 capabilities and technologies have great potential for both military and civilian applications, enabling highly effective security support tools for improving surveillance activities in densely crowded environments.

A home equipped with heterogeneous devices, whose services and location constantly change, needs to behave as a coherent system supporting its inhabitants. In this paper, we present a fully implemented architecture for domotic applications which uses the concept of a service as its fundamental abstraction. The architecture distinguishes between a pervasive layer where devices and their basic internetworking live, and a composition layer where services can be dynamically composed as a reaction to user desires or home events. Next to the architecture, we also illustrate a visualization and simulation environment to test home coordination scenarios. From the technical point of view, the implementation uses UPnP as the basic device connection protocol and techniques from Artificial Intelligence planning for composing services at runtime.;;;;;Aiello, Marco/0000-0002-0764-2124;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-1735708;;;;2010;6470;;;;;;167;181;;;;;;;;;WOS:000286691600012;;;;;;

Despite this, most games still fail to provide true adaptability in their AI, resulting in situations where an intermediate level player is able to predict the AI's behavior in a short amount of time, leading to a predictable and boring game experience. Creating a truly adaptive AI would greatly benefit a videogame's intrinsic value by providing a more immersive and unpredictable game experience.

Robotic Soccer is very appropriate for researching in Distributed AI problems, e.g. coordination methodologies, whose results can later be applied to other domains. Coordination can be defined as the capability of several agents to work together as a team, in order to accomplish a common goal. In the context of robotic soccer, several aspects may benefit from appropriate coordination methodologies, since team play is decisive for winning the games. This paper presents a methodology to enable a team of robotic soccer agents to coordinate their positioning in the field, and a methodology that enables them to cooperatively execute predefined set plays (flexible plans). Both coordination methods are used in real soccer and sports in general, commonly known as formations and set plays respectively. However, its use in a team of autonomous agents is still unexplored and is a major innovation of this work. A graphical tool to define formations and set plays was fully developed in the context of this work offering a quicker and more appealing way to define both formations and set plays. The tool's interface was inspired on blackboard applications, used nowadays for the same purpose in real sports. The tool enables very easy definition of set plays that may then be executed in real-time during the matches. Examples of complete set plays and their practical execution are also described, showing the usefulness of the set play concept and the utility of the developed tool.;;;;"Mota, Luis/A-6698-2013; Lau, Nuno/E-5934-2010; Reis, Luis Paulo/C-5751-2008";"Mota, Luis/0000-0002-7367-8475; Lau, Nuno/0000-0003-0513-158X; Reis, Luis Paulo/0000-0002-4709-1718";;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-989-96247-2-6;;;;2010;;;;;;;582;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000282903000097;;;;;;

Combining sensor networks with artificial intelligence and pattern recognition is envisaged to deliver smart application to end-users. In this paper, a new distributed energy efficient pattern recognition approach is proposed to first depict events of interest as patterns and then detect the occurrence of events of interest, namely: the Voting with Random Node Selection (VRNS) approach. Sensor nodes may leverage their processing and storage capabilities by collectively handling sensory data to translate local sensory information of individual sensor nodes into meaningful results that depict the global status of the environment. In contrast to classical pattern recognition approaches, the VRNS approach operates within the constrained sensor network's resources and infrastructures. Instead of utilising the entire sensor network, events of interest are recognised by employing an arbitrary sample of sensor nodes. The results show that the VRNS approach is capable of prolonging the longevity of the network's lifetime, recognising event patterns effectively, and avoiding over-utilisation hotspots in the network.;;;;"Baqer, M/E-1859-2017; Baqer, Mohamed/AAH-2001-2020";;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-14890-3;;;;2010;6294;;;;;;148;159;;;;;;;;;WOS:000284816200014;;;;;;

The GEP is an evolution of Genetic Programming, which is part of the Genetic Algorithms. GEP seeks for mathematical functions, adjusting to a given set of solutions using a type of genetic heuristics from a population of random functions.

This problem shares similarities with the job-shop problem, which is known to be a NP-hard problem, making a complete approach infeasible. In the case of ALMA, 18000 projects per season are expected, and the best schedule must be found in the order of minutes. The problem imposes severe difficulties: the large domain of observation projects to be taken into account; a complex objective function, composed of several abstract, environmental, and hardware constraints; the number of restrictions imposed and the dynamic nature of the problem, as weather is an ever-changing variable. A solution can benefit from the use of High-Performance Computing for the final implementation to be deployed, but also for the development process. Our research group proposes the use of both metaheuristic search and statistical learning algorithms, in order to create schedules in a reasonable time. How these techniques will be applied is yet to be determined as part of the ongoing research. Several algorithms need to be implemented, tested and evaluated by the team. This work presents the methodology proposed to lead the development of the scheduler. The basic functionality is encapsulated into software components implemented on parallel architectures.

Interesting and successful examples can be found in domain as diverse as coding and communications, signal processing, artificial intelligence, game theory, high-dimensional statistics. At least four reasons can be found for this success: 1. They are widely applicable whenever the underlying problem has a 'local' structure with respect to a suitable graph; 2. They are easy to implement and have linear or next-to-linear complexity (within coding they are widely implemented in hardware); 4. They often subsume existing heuristics as special cases; 5. On some random instance distributions which are important in practice, they can be analyzed precisely and tuned to achieve near-optimal performances. Each of these five points can be argued through examples.

Specifically, those based on Connectionist Systems and on Evolutionary Computation have been applied successfully in the analysis of big experimental data bases which were obtained in civil engineering. In this paper it is presented an approach by means of these two techniques applied to specific matters of reinforced concrete. The application has a bearing on the analysis of the drying creep of the concrete under controlled conditions (in specimen). The data base from RILEM is used as the main core of the test set. This article shows the process that has been done. This process is divided into three parts. First the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) technique has been used to identify variables that are essential to the phenomenon of creep.

Conventional methods are usually based on statistics and the missing rainfall data are estimated using neighbouring stations. The same procedure is implemented here using two models based on artificial intelligence techniques. A fuzzy logic and an Artificial Neural Network model are used to predict rainfall heights of two meteorological stations. A number of model parameters were modified during the calibration, in order to achieve the best performance. The comparison between observed and estimated values showed that both models perform satisfactorily in the prediction of rainfall data.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1743-3541;;978-1-84564-446-8;;;;2010;134;;;;;;133;144;;10.2495/SI100121;;;;;;;WOS:000306716200012;;;;;;

It would be impossible to retrieve information from satellite and medical images without the help of image processing techniques. Edge enhancement is an image processing step that enhances the edge contrast of an image or video in an attempt to improve its acutance. Edges are the representations of the discontinuities of image intensity functions. For processing these discontinuities in an image, a good edge enhancement technique is essential. The proposed work uses a new idea for edge enhancement using hybridized smoothening filters and we introduce a promising technique of obtaining best hybrid filter using swarm algorithms (Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)) to search for an optimal sequence of filters from among a set of rather simple, representative image processing filters. This paper deals with the analysis of the swarm intelligence techniques through the combination of hybrid filters generated by these algorithms for image edge enhancement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-17562-6;;;;2010;6466;;;;;;370;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000286284400045;;;;;;

With the so called argumentation frameworks (AFs) it is possible to represent statements (arguments) together with a binary attack relation between them. The conflicts between the statements are solved on a semantical level by selecting acceptable sets of arguments. An increasing amount of data requires an automated computation of such solutions. Logic Programming in particular Answer-Set Programming (ASP) turned out to be adequate to solve problems associated to such AFs. In this work we use ASP to design a sophisticated system for the evaluation of several types of argumentation frameworks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1868-8969;;978-3-939897-17-0;;;;2010;7;;;;;;265;269;;10.4230/LIPIcs.ICLP.2010.265;;;;;;;WOS:000392002600032;;;;;;

The path planning algorithm takes input from virtual map buffer which is present in the CPU memory.

It can solve the problem that experience is relied on high to the pattern maker. Shirt pattern has been analyzed and determined the size of the control parts. There are one input layer which has five nodes vector: bust, shoulder width, neck circumference, length, sleeve length, and one hidden layer which has eight nodes vector, and one output layer which has eighteen nodes vector: front bust, front chest width, front collar width, back bust width, back bust, front shoulder width, front shoulder slop and so on.

Subsequently there is an imminent risk of a directory structures becoming unbalanced, uneven and difficult to use to all except for a few users proficient with the particular Web directory and its domain. These problems emphasize the need to establish two important issues: i) generic and objective measures of Web directories structure quality, and mechanism for fully automated development of a Web directory's structure. In this paper we demonstrate how to formally and fully integrate Web directories with the Semantic Web vision. We propose a set of criteria for evaluation of a Web directory's structure quality. Some criterion functions are based on heuristics while others require the application of ontologies. We also suggest an ontology-based algorithm for construction of Web directories. By using ontologies to describe the semantics of Web resources and Web directories' categories it is possible to define algorithms that can build or rearrange the structure of a Web directory. Assessment procedures can provide feedback and help steer the ontology-based construction process.

Usually these modelling techniques are applied to factories and to the internal organisation of their process flows, thus obtaining models of complex organisations at various levels of aggregation. The dynamics in living cells are often interpreted in terms of well-organised processes, a bacterium being considered a (micro)factory. This suggests that organisation modelling techniques may also benefit their analysis. Using the example of Escherichia coli it is shown how indeed agent-based organisational modelling techniques can be used to simulate and analyse E.coli's intracellular dynamics.

Financial crises are recurrent phenomena in modern financial systems. The literature offers several definitions of financial instability, but it is well known that a financial crisis with a banking crisis is the most common example of financial instability. In this paper we introduce a novel model for detection and prediction of crises, based on the hybridization of a standard logistic regression with Product Unit (PU) neural networks and Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks. These hybrid approaches are described in the paper, and applied to the detection and prediction of banking crises by using a large database of countries in the period 1981 to 1999. The proposed techniques are shown to perform better than other existing statistical and artificial intelligence methods for this problem.;;;;"Portilla-Figueras, Jose Antonio/G-8633-2013; Salcedo-Sanz, Sancho/F-3936-2014; SEGOVIA-VARGAS, MARIA-JESUS/I-3637-2017; Hervas-Martinez, Cesar/A-3979-2009; Gutierrez, Pedro Antonio/K-6051-2014";"Salcedo-Sanz, Sancho/0000-0002-4048-1676; SEGOVIA-VARGAS, MARIA-JESUS/0000-0002-6578-8017; Hervas-Martinez, Cesar/0000-0003-4564-1816; Gutierrez, Pedro Antonio/0000-0002-2657-776X; Fernandez-Navarro, Francisco/0000-0002-5599-6170";;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-13032-8;;;;2010;6098;;;;;;1;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000281604700001;;;;;;

Thermal insulation standards are now contractual obligations in new buildings, the energy efficiency in the case of buildings constructed before the regulations adopted is still an open issue, and the assumption is that it will be based on heat flux and conductivity measurement. A three-step procedure is proposed in this study that begins by considering the local building and heating system regulations as well as the specific features of the climate zone. Firstly, the dynamic thermal performance of different variables is specifically modeled. Secondly, an exploratory projection pursuit method called Cooperative Maximum-Likelihood Hebbian Learning is used to extract the relevant features. Finally, a supervised neural model and identification techniques are applied, in order to detect the heat flux through exterior walls in the building. The reliability of the proposed method is validated for a winter zone, associated to several cities in Spain.;;;;"de la Cal Marin, Enrique/L-3203-2014; Sedano, Javier/L-2348-2014; Villar, Jose/K-7547-2014";"de la Cal Marin, Enrique/0000-0001-7142-7544; Sedano, Javier/0000-0002-4191-8438; Villar, Jose/0000-0001-6024-9527";;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-13032-8;;;;2010;6098;;;;;;636;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000281604700065;;;;;;

By analyzing the Artificial Neuron Model, this paper predicts that with the current tendencies in the increase of the microprocessor's power in 2050 the processing power of computers could reach the processing power of the human brain. Besides that, while the robotic systems integration becomes harder and no standards exist in this matter, the use of Artificial Neural Networks becomes more popular.

However, little attention has been paid to integrate Fuzzy Rule Based-Systems into Wireless Sensor Network. Since traditional approaches of Fuzzy Rule Based-Systems cannot be applied, due to limited resources that the sensors nodes have, the principal aim of this work is to design a distributed knowledge based Wireless Sensor Network, where each node of the network executes an adapted Fuzzy Rule Based-System. This aim has been divided into the followings: 1) to design a Fuzzy Rule Based-System adapted to a sensor node, 2) to design an application protocol which allows transmitting knowledge bases to sensors nodes and 3) to simulate a particular scenario with network simulator ns-2. The performance of a Sun SPOT sensor has been evaluated and a comparison to other devices is reported. The results show that a Sun SPOT sensor can execute properly a Fuzzy Rule Based-System adapted to it, and that it is possible to create a useful distributed knowledge based Wireless Sensor Network.;;;;"Velasco, Juan R.

However, patterns that allow the prediction of some movements can be found. Stock market analysis deals with the study of these patterns. It uses different techniques and strategies, mostly automatic that trigger buying and selling orders depending on different decision making algorithms. It can be considered as an intelligent treatment of past and present financial data in order to predict the stock market future behavior. Therefore it can be viewed as an artificial intelligence problem in the data mining field.

One of the most important reasons to empirically test the content during the development phase is the balance of the adaptive framework. Empirical testing is time-consuming and in many cases several iterative cycles are needed. In 2007 we started to develop methods of testing in a computational test bench. The idea to speed up the production process was based on software agents that could behave like real user community. The study shows that we can construct very reliable artificial behaviour when comparing it to human behaviour in group level. On design phase's usability tests, we are especially interested in group behaviour, not on single action etc., which means that the method suits for it's purposes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-989-674-025-2;;;;2010;;;;;;;291;296;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392689200042;;;;;;

These coordinates represent location which is an essential ingredient for location based services and web mapping. Despite progress in the field of geocoding, there remains a sizable proportion of addresses that are difficult to geocode. The purpose of this research was to explore how agent-based processing, which utilizes the belief, desire, intention (BDI) model, can add intelligence to the geocoding process. The event driven nature of agent-based processing makes it suitable for use in a web service platform. The event-driven and reactive behaviour is complemented by the ability for goal directed and non-deterministic behaviour in the longer term. Overall control of the geocoding process is based on the interactions between agents which represent the geographic elements contained in an address. Each of these agents operate in parallel, pursuing tasks associated with correcting and preparing their individual element for geocoding. This results in a geocoding process that has multiple foci of control and is iterative. The same geographic relationships that exist between the address elements also exist between the agents. Messages are used for the agents to send and receive data between themselves, and because the agents represent geographic elements, these messages have content relating to their real world geographic relationships. These relationships form the basis of the inherent semantics in the intelligent framework. Results indicate that intelligence in geocoding is a product of both context and semantics, at a conceptual level, and control and knowledge, at an implementation level, where the two are connected by the agent paradigm which is both a representation and a solution. This paper presents the agent component of the framework used to enable intelligent geocoding and the results from a prototype implemented using the intelligent framework.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2194-9034;;;;;;2010;38-4;W13;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000358303400013;;;;;;

Computer system MELEC composes music using evolutionary computation on two levels: the object and the meta. At the object-level, MELEC employs GAs to compose melodic motifs and iteratively refine them through evolving generations. At the meta-level, MELEC forms the overall musical structure by concatenating the generated motifs in an order that depends on the evolutionary process. In other words, the structure of the music is determined by a geneological traversal of the algorithm's execution sequence. In this implementation, we introduce a new data structure that tracks the execution of the GA, the Genetic Algorithm Traversal Tree, and uses its traversal to define the musical structure. Moreover, we employ a Fibonacci-based fitness function to shape the melodic evolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-934272-98-5;;;;2010;;;;;;;113;118;;;;;;;;;WOS:000391420000023;;;;;;

Co-Mining (R) based dccidcr track, dt, is a unique proprietary Electronic Neurotransmitter technology which literally mimics both the conscious and intuitive reasoning of humans - hunch decisions. It introduces the new generation of mining technologies, the cooperative mining, based on the active intelligence principle: THINKING and INVESTIGATING is a succession of micro-decisions and requests which dynamically connect-the-dots of information to build a global picture for decision. dt acts as Cyber_Tracker, travelling in the global cyberspace with requests to link information distributed in space and in time;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-934272-99-2;;;;2010;;;;;;;37;41;;;;;;;;;WOS:000391419900008;;;;;;

Method was originally designed for wood-processing companies to reveal their true identity (corporate identity). Using this method it is possible to detect possible causes of the existence of weaknesses and strengths of the company, which is impossible to detect using conventional methods such as SWOT analysis. Body therapy applies a holistic approach to human beings. In our proposed method, we attempted to apply a holistic approach to an enterprise, the firm is seen as a human being or as an artificial intelligence, and this means that the company is personified.;;;;Matova, Hana/D-8863-2018;Matova, Hana/0000-0001-7388-8088;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-80-228-2160-5;;;;2010;;;;;;;3;7;;;;;;;;;WOS:000340477100001;;;;;;

The discussion is intended to be a somewhat speculative and thought provoking journey into what may be possible. At its root, it imagines a future time when the technological singularity has been reached, and machine intelligence and interaction is equal or surpasses that of people. I do this by means of a fictional reflection on how life might be in the future, a set of four small vignettes and a discussion of the factual research inspiring these views.;;;;Callaghan, Victor/X-9302-2018;Callaghan, Victor/0000-0003-3353-9726;;;;;;;;;;;;1875-4163;;"978-1-60750-639-3; 978-1-60750-638-6";;;;2010;8;;;;;;223;232;;10.3233/978-1-60750-639-3-223;;;;;;;WOS:000393056000027;;;;;;

In this paper we presents a neuro-fuzzy approach, based on fuzzy logic and neural networks, to define the student module of an experimental ITS implemented to obtain an objective assessment of physical activity education. The input values used for activity assessment are the energy estimated for physical activity task and the energy real expends for the same activity, while the classification of learning is based on a evaluation scale with six different literal rank.

Non-traditional advertising methods and new product exhibition alternatives emerged. Forums and review sites allow end users to suggest, recommend or rate products according to their experiences. This gave raise to the study of such data collections. After analyze, store and process them properly, they are used to make reports used to assist in middle to high staff decision making. This research aims to implement concepts and approaches of artificial intelligence to this area. The framework proposed here (named GDARIM), is able to be parameterized and handled to other similar problems in different fields. To do that it first performs deep problem analysis to determine the specific domain variables and attributes. Then, it implements specific functionality for the current data collection and available storage. Next, data is analyzed and processed, using Genetic Algorithms to retro feed the keywords initially loaded. Finally, properly reports of the results are displayed to stakeholders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-988-17012-0-6;;;;2010;;;;;;;480;484;;;;;;;;;WOS:000292889100090;;;;;;

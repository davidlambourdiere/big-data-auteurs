However, the organizational take-up of hyped technologies, such as AI, is accompanied by the danger that expectations regarding the benefits of the technology are not realistic which can result in failed innovation projects. This paper investigates expectations of two groups of enterprises from different application domains towards the organizational AI use. The results of the study indicate that often the technology is put into the focus rather than the organizational context which leads to neglecting requirements regarding process integration or data availability. As a consequence, the paper proposes a method component adding to enterprise architecture management, which describes how the organizational context of AI can be determined as support for AI requirements analysis and feasibility studies. The method component is demonstrated in a project aiming at introducing AI into instant payment transactions.;"[Sandkuhl, Kurt] Univ Rostock, Rostock, Germany; [Sandkuhl, Kurt] Univ Jonkoping, Jonkoping, Sweden";"Sandkuhl, K (corresponding author), Univ Rostock, Rostock, Germany.; Sandkuhl, K (corresponding author), Univ Jonkoping, Jonkoping, Sweden.";kurt.sandkuhl@uni-rostock.de;;;;;;33;0;0;2;2;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2378-1963;;978-1-7281-0650-2;CONF BUS INFORM;;;2019;;;;;;;157;164;;10.1109/CBI.2019.00025;;;8;"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications";"Business & Economics; Computer Science";BP6PP;WOS:000560369000018;;;;;2020-12-16;

While going outdoors contributes to participation and well-being, older adults often avoid to go outdoors because of deteriorating health and individual perceptions of threats to their safe mobility. A particular perceived threat to safety and a crucial barrier to go outdoors is the perception of lacking appropriate seating possibilities. To mitigate this barrier, we introduce an adaptive park bench system as an innovative form of smart urban objects. The system of adaptive park benches seeks to ensure that each pedestrian has available an appropriate seat when necessary. Empty adaptive park benches are particularly appropriate due to an active assistance functionality for sitting down and standing up. We developed an AI based algorithm and validated its effectiveness by conducting a simulation of a use case scenario created with domain experts.;[Hubl, Marvin] Univ Hohenheim, Informat Syst 2, Stuttgart, Germany;Hubl, M (corresponding author), Univ Hohenheim, Informat Syst 2, Stuttgart, Germany.;marvin.hubl@uni-hohenheim.de;;;Federal Ministry of Education and Research, GermanyFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [16SV7438K];This work is part of the research project URBANLIFE+ and has been supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany, under grant 16SV7438K.;;33;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2378-1963;;978-1-7281-0650-2;CONF BUS INFORM;;;2019;;;;;;;373;382;;10.1109/CBI.2019.00049;;;10;"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications";"Business & Economics; Computer Science";BP6PP;WOS:000560369000042;;;;;2020-12-16;

Here the basic problems are to find R&D's results and/or teams for solving the professional tasks and for making investment. But business has no personal view on scientific problems. So business is seeking the objective tools for forecasting and evaluation of R&D prospects and results. Experts have own interests and require a lot of funding. R&D reflections are the texts. The modern methods of computer analysis of texts can do a lot of the experts' work for making it more objective and cheaper. The tools for search, systematization and ranking R&D's results and teams are computer analysis of texts and the map of science. The map of science is the distribution of the collection of texts of a scientific nature by the topics. The map of science is a way to navigate through the world of scientific publications and R&D's teams, a tool for identifying trends and assessing R&D directions. The usual ways for the map of science formation use bibliometric/scientometric data, general probability models of the texts, expert's opinion or artificial intelligence (AI) models and methods based on the thesaurus or on the ontology of the subject domains. The interests of business are not in line with the orientation on a priori established ideas about possible topics or there number for rapidly changing scientific fields. Precisely these fields are of the greatest interest to business. On the basis of mathematical modeling of texts and large-scale text collections, an approach is proposed for the computational formation of the adaptive dynamic map of science that does not use a priori classification schemes and data of the scientific publications' citation. Topics (thematic groups), their number and the distribution of texts over the topics are determined computationally without experts' involvement. Examples of the maps of science for various collections of scientific publications are given. The original method is proposed for checking the adequacy of the text models and the map of science. The method uses the categorization of articles and their abstracts as the separate objects on the basis of computationally generated map (its topics). The results of the large-scale experiment confirmed the high efficiency of the proposed mathematical modeling of texts and text collections. The possibilities of practical use of the map of science for business applications are considered.;"[Kreines, Mikhail G.; Kreines, Elena M.] BaseTech Llc, Moscow, Russia";Kreines, MG (corresponding author), BaseTech Llc, Moscow, Russia.;mkrf@yandex.ru;;;;;;21;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2378-1963;;978-1-7281-0650-2;CONF BUS INFORM;;;2019;;;;;;;445;451;;10.1109/CBI.2019.00058;;;7;"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications";"Business & Economics; Computer Science";BP6PP;WOS:000560369000051;;;;;2020-12-16;

This led to the use of many intelligent applications and emerging the smart cities which highly rely on modern technologies such as smart telecommunication, smart grid, smart transportation, artificial intelligence, smart health, enterprise Internet of Things, smart building management systems and smart governance. These introduced new services and practices which highly impacting the planning, policy, development, and operation of infrastructure of society, while co-exist with urban facilities, and must be electromagnetic compatible with the existing systems. Hence, it initiated Intentional Electromagnetic Interference which could be a significant threat towards civil, defense, industrial, and commercial sectors, with possible targets of radio and television, telecommunication networks, grid power networks, railway networks, air traffic control, government and banking administrative networks, or even defense system as well. The susceptibility and vulnerability of these sensitive systems due to the electromagnetic interference in the current decades will keep of increasing due to the expansion and spread of radiation sources.. Threats from high power microwave sources and high power electromagnetic pulses and high-altitude electromagnetic pulse on civil and defense infrastructure that include an electronic equipment and wireless systems could be harmful and may cause disturbances and damages on electronic devices and wireless systems. This paper presents an overview of the important events in history related to the high power electromagnetic sources that is paving the way for enhancing the understanding of electromagnetic interference capabilities in disturbing modern infrastructure systems.

There has been a significant amount of research conducted in developing tool condition monitoring systems with the application of various sensory systems and artificial intelligence techniques for processing and predicting tool wear. Although artificial intelligent techniques have shown significant results in tool condition prediction, the fundamental methodology adopted by these techniques for predicting tool condition still needs to be investigated. This study aims in applying and investigating deep learning techniques for tool condition monitoring in end milling process based on spectrogram features of audible sound collected during the machining process and employing a deep visualization technique to gain the knowledge on inner workings of the deep learning models in the tool wear prediction. Specifically, this study applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to develop a tool condition monitoring model and performs hyper-parameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy. In addition, the class saliency extraction technique has been used by this study to generate the saliency maps to visualize the specific features utilized by the CNN model for a given spectrogram of audio signal. Furthermore, the study examines the saliency maps of different tool condition levels to understand the intuition of proposed CNN model in selecting the specific localized features of spectrogram for accurate prediction.

The fourth industrial revolution is promising increased growth and productivity by the Smart Factory and within the enabling technologies is Augmented Reality (AR). At the same time as the technology is introduced, errors in manufacturing are a problem which is affecting the productivity and the quality. This research aims to find the main causes of human errors in assembly lines and thereafter explores whether augmented reality is an appropriate tool to be used in order to address those issues. Based on a literature review that identified and characterized a preliminary set of root causes for human errors in assembly lines, these causes were empirically studied in an exercise that covered an in-depth case study in a multinational automotive company. Data in form of interviews and deviation-reports have been used to identify the causing factors and the result showed that the main causes of human errors are the amount of thinking, deciding and searching for information which affected the cognitive load of the operator and in result their performance. Several interviews with experts in augmented reality allowed to verify if AR technology would be feasible to solve or mitigate the found causes. Besides that, in repetitive manual assembly operations, AR is better used showing the process in order to train new operators. At the same time for experienced operators, AR should show information only when an error occurs and when there is a need of taking an active choice. Nevertheless, while theoretically able to managing human error when fully developed, the desired application makes the augmentation of visual objects redundant and increasingly complex for solving the identified causes of errors which questions the appropriateness of using AR systems. Furthermore, the empirical findings showed that for managing human errors, the main bottleneck of an AR system is the systems artificial intelligence capabilities. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Despite that, the production controller still relies heavily on intrinsic knowledge and intuition for the management of disruptions in production. Thanks to advances in the fields of production control and artificial intelligence, potentials for the collected data for disruption management arise. However, in order to transform data into usable information and allow drawing conclusions for disruption management in production, the relevant data-objects, disturbances and alternative actions must be known. Thus, the decision-making can be supported, reducing the decision latency and increasing benefit of alternative actions. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to discuss the prerequisites necessary to perform a data based disruption management and the methodology itself, serving as an approach to allow companies to build a data basis, classify disruptions and alternative actions in order to improve decision making in the future.;"[Luetkehoff, Ben; Stich, Volker; Schroeter, Moritz; Steinlein, Felix] FIR eV, Campus Blvd 55, D-52074 Aachen, Germany";Luetkehoff, B (corresponding author), FIR eV, Campus Blvd 55, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.;ben.luetkehoff@fir.rwth-aachen.de;;;European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)European Union (EU) [EFRE/ERDF-0800924];The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funded the presented research (grant number EFRE/ERDF-0800924).

Additionally, sharing data between organisations, conducting data analytics and collaborating to create new business insight requires inter-organisational collaboration. This study shows that analysing highly anonymised and professional conversation data challenges the capabilities of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms alone cannot learn the internal connections and meanings of information cues. This experiment is therefore in line with prior research in interactive machine learning where data scientists, specialists and computational agents interact. This study reveals that, alongside humans, computational agents will be important actors in collaborative networks. Thus, humans are needed in several phases of the machine learning process for facilitating and training. This calls for collaborative working in multi-disciplinary teams of data scientists and substance experts interacting with computational agents.;"[Alamaki, Ari; Aunimo, Lili] Haaga Helia Univ Appl Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Ketamo, Harri] HeadAI Oy, Pori, Finland; [Parvinen, Lasse] Terveystalo Oy, Helsinki, Finland";Alamaki, A (corresponding author), Haaga Helia Univ Appl Sci, Helsinki, Finland.;"ari.alamaki@haaga-helia.fi; lili.aunimo@haaga-helia.fi; harri.ketamo@headai.com; lasse.parvinen@terveystalo.com";;;"Big data big business-project; Business Finland";The authors would like to thank the Big data big business-project, all the parties behind the project, and Business Finland - for its support for this study.;;27;0;0;2;2;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;1868-4238;1868-422X;"978-3-030-28464-0; 978-3-030-28463-3";IFIP ADV INF COMM TE;;;2019;;;;;;;173;184;;10.1007/978-3-030-28464-0_16;;;12;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Telecommunications";BP6QQ;WOS:000560401400016;;;;;2020-12-16;

Thus, uncertainty is an inherent part of decision-making when using the outcomes of data-driven models created by AI/ML algorithms. In order to deal with this - especially in the context of safety-related systems - we need to make uncertainty transparent via dependable statistical statements. This paper introduces both a conceptual model and the related mathematical foundation of an uncertainty wrapper solution for data-driven models.

However, making a diagnosis at an early stage of the disease is difficult in the case of most diseases initially present and with similar symptoms and signs. Specific medical expert systems based on the integration of traditional Western and Eastern medicine helps to identify the causes of the disease in early stage. Differentiated analyses of the relationship of diseases will provide an opportunity to identify constitutional-dependent signs of the disease and risk factors, will individualizes the prognosis and treatment, which, in turn, help to improve the results of treatment of the disease. Medical diagnostic expert system (MDES) based on the integration of traditional Western and Eastern medicine is for studying additional factors of the disease, in particular, the influence of anthropological and psychological data of a person on the manifestation of the disease. The probability theory, mathematical statistics and some methods of artificial intelligence are applied for development of basic model. The diagnoses vector basis both: general doctor opinion and indicators of individual diseases. The knowledge base of MDES developed based on the integration of various sources: reflection forms which links key constitutional types of the human body and traditional Western diagnoses. The MDES provides doctors of the differential diagnosis hypothesis reliable from the point of view of the expert system based on the entered symptoms and expected, existing or excluded related diagnoses.

Essentially, an attack graph illustrates a what-if analysis, thereby, helping the network administrator to plan for potential security threats. However, current attack graph representations not only suffer from scaling issues, but also are difficult to generate. Despite efforts from the research community there are no automated tools for generating attack graphs from textual descriptions of vulnerabilities such as those from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Additionally, there is little support for incremental updates and refinements to an attack graph model. This is needed to reflect changes to an attack graph that arise because of changes to the vulnerability state of the underlying system being modeled. In this work, we present an artificial intelligence (AI) based planning tool, AGBuilder - Attack Graph Builder, for automatically generating, updating and refining attack graphs. A key contribution of AGBuilder is that it uses textual descriptions of vulnerabilities to automatically generate attack graphs. Another significant contribution is that, using AGBuilder, we describe a methodology to incrementally update attack graphs when the system changes. This aspect has not been addressed in prior research and is a crucial step for achieving resiliency in the face of evolving adversarial strategies. Finally, AGBuilder has the ability to reuse smaller attack graphs, e.g., when building a network of networks, and join them together to create larger attack graphs.;"[Bezawada, Bruhadeshwar] Mahindra Ecole Cent, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; [Ray, Indrajit; Tiwary, Kushagra] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Ray, Indrajit] Natl Sci Fdn, Alexandria, VA USA";Bezawada, B (corresponding author), Mahindra Ecole Cent, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.;"indrajit.ray@colostate.edu; bru@mechyd.ac.in; kushagra.tiwary@colostate.edu";;Bezawada, Bruhadeshwar/0000-0002-1021-8121;U.S. Department of Energy under Ohio State University [DE-NE0008571];This work is partially supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under award number DE-NE0008571 subcontracted through the Ohio State University.

Nature-inspired swarm intelligence algorithms are prominent and efficient optimization techniques for solving that kind of problems.

Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a significant member in the area of SI-based strategies. This research propounds a local search (LS) strategy motivated by the generation of the Fibonacci sequence. Further, the propound LS strategy is integrated with ABC to enhance the exploitation behavior. The propound LS strategy is named as Fibonacci-inspired local search (FLS) strategy and the hybridized algorithm is termed as Fibonacci-inspired artificial bee colony (FABC) algorithm. In the propound LS strategy, the Fibonacci series equation is altered by incorporating the commitment and community-based learning elements of ABC algorithm. To analyze the potential of the propound strategy, it is analyzed over 31 benchmark optimization functions.

To better understand this relationship, different situations could be simulated during which the users' emotional reactions are analyzed through sensors like eye tracking and EEG. In addition, virtual reality environments provide an immersive simulation context that induces high intensity emotions such as excitement. Extracting excitement from EEG provides more precise measures then other methods, however it is not always possible to use EEG headset in virtual reality environment. In this paper we present an alternative approach to the use of EEG for excitement detection using only eye movements. Results showed that there is a correlation between eye movements and excitement index extracted from EEG. Five machine learning algorithms were used in order to predict excitement trend exclusively from eye tracking. Results revealed that we can detect the offline excitements trend directly from eye movements with a precision of 92% using deep neural network.;"[Ben Abdessalem, Hamdi; Chaouachi, Maher; Boukadida, Marwa; Frasson, Claude] Univ Montreal, Dept Comp Sci & Operat Res, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada";Ben Abdessalem, H (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Comp Sci & Operat Res, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.;"benabdeh@iro.umontreal.ca; chaouacm@iro.umontreal.ca; boukadim@iro.umontreal.ca; frasson@iro.umontreal.ca";;;"NSERC-CRDNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Beam Me Up";We acknowledge NSERC-CRD and Beam Me Up for funding this work.;;20;1;1;0;0;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-22244-4; 978-3-030-22243-7";LECT NOTES COMPUT SC;;;2019;11528;;;;;;214;223;;10.1007/978-3-030-22244-4_26;;;10;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications";Computer Science;BP6WK;WOS:000560804100026;;;;;2020-12-16;

In this paper, we considered three problems connected with intellectual analysis of biomedical signals. A developed means of identifying a person using only one standard electrocardiographic lead is presented. New algorithms for recognition of several classes of dangerous arrhythmias have been developed and investigated in order to prevent catastrophic events in the course of continuous monitoring of the patient's state by ECG. This study also describes a method and an algorithm for automatic estimation of the anesthesia depth by the parameters of the approximated entropy of the EEG signal. The results of the work are used in the design of intelligent biomedical systems. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

For deep reinforcement learning teaching, we do not have an appropriate platform for making optimal labs. In the article, after studying the theoretical foundations and the requirements of the main platforms, we selected two open source platforms, according to their characteristics: robotic simulators platforms for teaching and benchmarking deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

The increased interconnectedness among devices, people, networks, and systems, however, introduces a level of complexity surpassing the experience accumulated so far. While the security of communications, network and information systems can be considered a well-established discipline, the study of security of cyber-physical systems is fairly recent. Furthermore, the dependencies of live organisms, including humans, with integrated sensors and electronics, of perceptions and cognition, and variety of drones on influences from cyberspace have been subject of only few, mostly incidental studies. The interdependencies among cyber, physical, biological systems, and humans in situation assessment and decision-making roles create new potential vectors of attack by malicious actors. If exploited, they will lead to cross impact among domains that are usually studied separately. Authors from three Bulgarian institutions, combining research and policy-making experience, embarked on the task to elaborate a comprehensive cybersecurity research agenda. This paper presents their concept for an integrative approach to the exploration of 'systems of systems.' The study is structured along five domains: communications and information systems and networks; cyber-physical system; bio-integrated systems; cognitive processes, i.e. the processes of shaping perceptions, assessing a certain situation and options and making decisions; and drones, remotely controlled or autonomous, the latter case being particularly reliant on advances in artificial intelligence. This paper outlines the problem of vulnerability of each of the five domains to influences from cyber space. Then it presents some advances in cross-domain understanding of vulnerabilities, supported by examples of cybersecurity studies, and provides the outlines of a corresponding, interdisciplinary research agenda, built around the concept of systems of systems.

Therefore, to explore the maximum potential of biomass, a detailed understanding of its embedded potential is needed. However, most experimental procedures require equipment that is highly sophisticated and expensive. The advancement of knowledge in artificial intelligence and blockchain technology is unlocking new potential prediction accuracy for biomass thermal properties. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is proving to be a vital tool that can enhance the research development in biomass energy prediction. This review highlights the stages in ANN modeling and the application of ANN in Biomass thermal value prediction.

As a result of increased use of sensors and networked machines in manufacturing operations, artificial intelligence techniques play a key role to derive meaningful value from big data infrastructure. These techniques can inform decision making and can enable the implementation of more sustainable practices in the manufacturing industry. In machining processes, a considerable amount of waste (scrap) is generated as a result of failure to monitor a tool condition. Therefore, an intelligent tool condition monitoring system is developed in this paper to identify sustainability-related manufacturing tradeoffs and a set of optimal machining conditions by monitoring the status of the machine tool. An evolutionary algorithm-based multi-objective optimization is used to find the optimal operating conditions, and the solutions are visualized using a Pareto optimal front. (C) 2019 The Authors.

This paper analyzes industrial engineering qualification and identifies the necessity for improving approaches in educational programs. Game-based learning is one of the educational approaches to promote learning for the digital transformation by setting goals, constraints, and payoffs.

In Sect. 1, we first mention five issues. Three involve ongoing activities which are suffering from drawbacks that one could improve and that are totally overlooked by the community. The other two issues are major topics of IT today: artificial intelligence and big data and analysis of big data. Those 5 issues will be discussed more thoroughly in Sect. 2. In the remainder of Sect. 1 we look at a plethora of other IT issues that we do not follow up in depth.

Starting out as mainly university research endeavors, recent significant breakthroughs have pushed the practicality of AI to the forefront. It is making fast inroads to traditional industrial applications and it is clear that given sufficient computing resources, AI is applicable to almost anything. The breakthrough referenced is mostly the result of the diligent persistence of a number of AI researchers in combination with large increases in available computation power to reconsider much deeper neural networks than previously used which were consistently rejected because of their large complexity reasons. Deep Neural Nets have proven to be an adept framework and up to solving the difficult challenges proven previous machine learning approaches could not solve. Recently, driven by enhanced computational power and necessity, edge applications have arisen to the forefront. Generally, now that cloud computing is available, a choice may be made where to locate the recognition engine, local to the data source or on the cloud where considerable computing resources are available. Hearing aids, a product on the edge now connected via one or more wireless links and fully immersed in IoT are the subject and consideration of this paper. It is natural to consider whether, via these links, remote computation is possible and appropriate for hearing aid applications. Difficulties arise when remote computation is attempted simply because the local data to be inferenced must be transmitted. Summarizing, utilizing remote computing for local recognition creates, two immediate problems: 1) the transmission of possibly private data across an insecure channel, and 2) the channel may not exist in remote or adverse transmission environments. Two further difficulties emerge in an important subset of applications, including hearing aids and hearable products: 1) Delay from the transmission latency required to obtain Cloud computation - although fast and capable - once the information is obtained and 2) Transmission power.;[Brennan, Robert L.] ON Semicond, 611 Kumpf Dr, Waterloo, ON N2V 1K8, Canada;Brennan, RL (corresponding author), ON Semicond, 611 Kumpf Dr, Waterloo, ON N2V 1K8, Canada.;robert.brennan@onsemi.com;;;;;;14;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;1548-3746;;978-1-7281-2788-0;MIDWEST SYMP CIRCUIT;;;2019;;;;;;;841;844;;;;;4;Engineering, Electrical & Electronic;Engineering;BP5LR;WOS:000556188100197;;;;;2020-12-16;

The main limitation of the state-of-the-art solutions for this type of applications is the high power consumption and the silicon area required, which strongly limit their implementation on portable devices. In this manuscript, we propose a new solution based on making use of voltage-controlled-oscillators based analog-to-digital converters (VCO-based ADCs). VCO-based ADCs have enabled efficient audio-oriented implementations in terms of power and area. Here, a VCO-based band-pass filter is proposed to extract the features of analog input sound signals and generate a digital output stream encoding the mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs). This digital signal will be processed afterwards by a decision circuit to determine whether the sound signal corresponds to a pattern. Additionally, the same VCO can be reused to implement both the band-pass filters in the decision mode and the standard ADC output once a keyword or voice has been detected, saving significant area. A behavioral model of the filter was built to validate the performance by simulation. Then, the architecture was designed using a 130-nm CMOS process to get a realistic outlook of the power consumption and the expected occupied area on silicon. Finally, the proposed solution was compared to other equivalent solutions.;"[Gutierrez, Eric; Perez, Carlos; Hernandez, Fernando; Hernandez, Luis] Carlos III Univ, Elect Technol Dept, Madrid, Spain";Gutierrez, E (corresponding author), Carlos III Univ, Elect Technol Dept, Madrid, Spain.;eric.gutierrez@uc3m.es;;;CICYT project, SpainConsejo Interinstitucional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CICYT) [TEC2017-82653-R];This work was supported by the CICYT project TEC2017-82653-R, Spain.;;12;1;1;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;1548-3746;;978-1-7281-2788-0;MIDWEST SYMP CIRCUIT;;;2019;;;;;;;1175;1178;;;;;4;Engineering, Electrical & Electronic;Engineering;BP5LR;WOS:000556188100274;;;;;2020-12-16;

First, we generate Approximate Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram (ROBDDs) representations of arbitrary compute kernels. These Approximate ROBDDs are then mapped to crossbar circuits for flow-based in-memory execution. We make improvement on two fronts, (i) approximation approach reduces computational requirements without sacrificing much accuracy (ii) in-memory computing circumvents the von Neumann bottleneck by unifying processing and storage. Our approach generates designs that are approximate to 10-80% more compact than exact designs while sacrificing small (less than 10%) amounts in accuracy.

ML provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. However, the potential of ML has not yet been tapped by most electric motor manufacturers. Therefore, this paper aims to summarize potential applications of ML along the whole process chain. To do so, basic methods, potentials and challenges of ML are discussed first. Secondly, special characteristics of the application domain are outlined. Building on this, various ML approaches directly relating to electric motor production are presented. In addition, a selection of transferable approaches from related sectors is included, as many ML approaches can be used across industries. In conclusion, the given overview of different ML approaches helps practitioners to better assess the possibilities and limitations of ML.

They allow knowledge to be structured and processed in such a way that it can be used for targeted support in complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. Especially during the design of production systems, such technologies have the potential to reduce planning efforts by providing existing expert knowledge. For electric motor manufactures, designing a proper production system remains a challenge due to low standards and numerous alternative manufacturing processes.

Apprenticeship learning via inverse reinforcement learning (AL via IRL) has been used as one of the primary candidate approaches to obtain a near optimal policy that is as good as that of the human policy. The algorithm works by attempting to recover and approximate the human reward function from the demonstrations. This approach assists in overcoming limitations such as the sensitivity associated with the variance in the quality of human data and the short sighted decision time that does not consider future states. However, addressing the problem of continuous action and state spaces has still been challenging in the AL via IRL algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new AL via IRL approach that is able to work with continuous action and state spaces. Our approach is used to train an artificial intelligence (AI) agent acting as a shepherd of artificial sheep-inspired swarm agents in a complex and dynamic environment. The results show that the performance of our approach is as good as that of the human operator, and particularly, the agent's movements seem to be smoother and more effective.;"[Hung The Nguyen; Garratt, Matthew; Bui, Lam Thu] Univ New South Wales, Sch Engn & Informat Technol, UNSW Canberra, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Abbass, Hussein] Le Quy Don Tech Univ, Dept Informat Technol, Hanoi, Vietnam";Nguyen, HT (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Engn & Informat Technol, UNSW Canberra, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;"hung.nguyen@student.adfa.edu.au; m.garratt@adfa.edu.au; h.abbass@adfa.edu.au; lam.bui07@gmail.com";Abbass, Hussein A/C-9563-2009;Abbass, Hussein A/0000-0002-8837-0748;;;;27;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-2485-8;;;;2019;;;;;;;102;109;;;;;8;Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence;Computer Science;BP5GE;WOS:000555467200015;;;;;2020-12-16;

We conduct experiments on 1 D and 2D grid worlds and demonstrate that using the proposed metric we can automatically construct computational models with emerging properties similar to those found in the Conway's Game of Life, as well as many other emergent phenomena.

Therefore, relay settings should be reviewed whenever there is a significant change in system conditions to ensure that they are still valid. Conventional relay coordination process has a limitation in the sense that it is deterministic, and the settings of subsequent relays depend on the initial guess of the settings of the initial relay. Therefore, this method does not necessarily provide solutions which guarantee optimal relay coordination, but the best of the solutions tried. Research has been conducted in recent years to investigate the solution by converting the relay coordination problem into an optimization problem and solving it using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). Due to their random nature and their ability to perform parallel search using a few potential solutions, EAs offer a possibility for optimal relay coordination. This paper investigates the effect of learning rate on the performance of the population based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithm as applied to relay coordination.

During the robot performance, audience robots tend to cheer up the performer robot through active feedbacks such as hands clapping, waving and laughing. The audience robot at the same time will lead human audiences to perform active feedback as well. As such, we believe that human audiences will be more attached to robot performance by communicating with audience robots.

In artificial intelligence, evolutionary computation and reinforcement learning were initially developed independently and in parallel but numerous studies of their interactions exist.

It helps, for example, to track terrorist propaganda on the internet and social media. Special programs are required to process large amounts of information. In this regard, the development of artificial intelligence, capable of creating analytical products in the field of security, is discussed by many researchers. The Strategic Research Agenda for Robotics in Europe 2014-2020 says the significant opportunities for robotics will be in (among others) the area of security (EU Robotics, 2014). The implementation of various technical solutions in the security field is often perceived ambiguously: law enforcement agencies may be accused of unjustified espionage. This often gives rise to a new round of public debates, in which provocateurs from terrorist groups can attack the reputation of law enforcement structures, accusing the state of repression. Along with these traditional challenges, new ones are emerging in the framework of psychological warfare. The generation of news items according to data received during the above-mentioned processes will also be increasingly generated by task automation bots. The possible use of such equipment by terrorist organisations will allow them to create, at certain moments, a quantitative predominance of terrorist propaganda. The author of the present paper used the methods of case studies, system and situation analysis. The research question was formulated as follows: how do the advanced technologies in so counterterrorism influence psychological warfare? We concluded that the European Union and Member States today turn to the active use of advanced technologies in combating terrorism and its propaganda. Despite undoubtedly positive effects, the practice of outsourcing in this field can meet obstacles if the interests of high tech companies contradict those of the authorities. This problem offers a perspective for further research, as does the spectrum of problems inherent in general in the counteraction of terrorism using advanced technologies.;"[Bazarkina, Darya] Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Dept Int Secur & Foreign Policy Russia, Natl Secur Fac, Inst Law & Natl Secur, Moscow, Russia; [Bazarkina, Darya] St Petersburg State Univ, Sch Int Relat, St Petersburg, Russia";"Bazarkina, D (corresponding author), Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Dept Int Secur & Foreign Policy Russia, Natl Secur Fac, Inst Law & Natl Secur, Moscow, Russia.; Bazarkina, D (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, Sch Int Relat, St Petersburg, Russia.";Bazarkina-icspsc@yandex.ru;"Bazarkina, Darya Yu./I-5469-2014; Bazarkina, Darya/AAT-7905-2020";"Bazarkina, Darya Yu./0000-0002-8421-5396; Bazarkina, Darya/0000-0002-8421-5396";Saint -Petersburg State University [26520757];The author acknowledges Saint -Petersburg State University for a research grant 26520757.;;24;2;2;0;0;ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD;NR READING;CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND;2048-9870;2048-9889;978-1-912764-11-2;INT C CYBER WARFARE;;;2019;;;;;;;23;29;;;;;7;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP6HZ;WOS:000559733900003;;;;;2020-12-16;

Al has been used to generate cyber attack plans since 2005, albeit for defensive purposes. This paper reports on work in progress aimed at developing a set of Al planning operators for generating attack plans for offensive cyber operations (000). The ultimate research goal is to develop an operator-set for the complete attack process, including foot-printing, reconnaissance, planning, target access, penetration, payload delivery, and after action review, that complies with the legal requirement to minimize collateral damage. The development of planning operators is greatly aided by first creating a formal ontology of the objects and relationships in the planning domain. There is a substantial literature on cyber attack ontologies. This literature was surveyed, showing that most ontologies are intended to help defenders classify incoming attacks. Consequently, they cover only the penetration and payload delivery phases of an attack, with the vulnerabilities exploited, attack goals, and effects being only represented in abstract terms. Only one ontology was found which modelled an attacker planning an attack. While classes representing ethical, legal, military, and physical constraints were included in the ontology, collateral effects were not represented. Accordingly, two supplementary literature surveys were done, one on ontologies for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR), and the other on means for controlling collateral damage in OCO. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the results of surveying the literature on cyber attack ontologies, on ontologies for ISTAR, and on means for controlling collateral damage in OCO. The three literature surveys are described. The results show that there is a need to construct an ontology for cyber ISTAR and to detail payload delivery and execution in existing cyber attack ontologies. The requirements for such an ontology are outlined.;[Grant, Tim] R BAR, Benschop, Netherlands;Grant, T (corresponding author), R BAR, Benschop, Netherlands.;tim.grant.work@gmail.com;;;;;;45;0;0;1;1;ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD;NR READING;CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND;2048-9870;2048-9889;978-1-912764-11-2;INT C CYBER WARFARE;;;2019;;;;;;;78;86;;;;;9;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP6HZ;WOS:000559733900009;;;;;2020-12-16;

Evidently, the arm's race between defenders and attackers favors the attackers. The rise of fake news and 'data poisoning' attacks aimed at machine learning inspired cyber threat intelligence systems is the result of a new strategy adopted by attackers that adds complexity to an already complex and ever changing cyber threat landscape. The modus operandi and TTPs of attackers continue to change with increasing repercussions. Attackers are now exploiting a vulnerability in the data training process of Al and ML inspired cyber threat intelligence systems by injecting 'poisoned data' in training datasets to allow their malicious code to evade detection. The 'poisoned' corpus is specifically tailored and targeted to Al and ML cyber threat intelligence defense systems. This is especially true for those based on supervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms to make them misclassify malicious code as legitimate data. This paper deals with the 'data poisoning' problem on different fronts. It starts by ensuring the completeness and standardization of the input datasets which, is vital to make accurate data -driven threat intelligence decisions. The input data itself is validated by using a mix of related indicators to determine its reliability. Based on the validation of input data sources, the authors make an assumption that the corpus is trustworthy and then add a security feature that prevents 'data poisoning' attacks. Based on these features, our model can be argued to provide a plausible solution to the 'data poisoning' problem of Al and ML inspired cyber threat intelligence systems. Our solution is based on working with trusted sources of input raw data. The dynamics of our solution changes completely if the input raw data comes with 'poisoned data' that mimic trusted data. This is one area that our future research will focus on.;"[Mahlangu, Thabo; January, Sinethemba; Mashiane, Thulani; Dlamini, Moses; Ngobeni, Sipho; Ruxwana, Nkqubela] CSIR, Def Peace Safety & Secur, CCIW, Pretoria, South Africa";Mahlangu, T (corresponding author), CSIR, Def Peace Safety & Secur, CCIW, Pretoria, South Africa.;"Mahlangu3@csir.co.za; SJanuary@csir.co.za; TMashiane@csir.co.za; TDlamini1@csir.co.za; SNgobeni@csir.co.za; LRuxwana@csir.co.za";;;;;;21;1;1;1;1;ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD;NR READING;CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND;2048-9870;2048-9889;978-1-912764-11-2;INT C CYBER WARFARE;;;2019;;;;;;;221;230;;;;;10;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP6HZ;WOS:000559733900026;;;;;2020-12-16;

Whilst we are not quite there yet, Google did present a recording of its new Assistant making a hair -dresser's appointment onstage at I/O 2018, sounding natural and even throwing in an 'mmhmmm'.

It is clear that AI has become the new buzzword taking over from all things cyber, but what do we actually mean when we use the term? This article argues that there are three main reasons for the inconsistent use of Al: a lack of understanding, leading to Al being a magical solution, a doomsday device, neither and both at the same time; a heated, often ethical, debate on the application of Al to armed conflict; and the opportunity that Al presents for financial gain.";"[Silomon, Jantje] Univ Oxford, Cyber Secur, Oxford, England; [Kaminska, Monica] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England";Silomon, J (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Cyber Secur, Oxford, England.;"jantje.silomon@cs.ox.ac.uk; monica.kaminska@politics.ox.ac.uk";;;;;;31;0;0;2;2;ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD;NR READING;CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND;2048-9870;2048-9889;978-1-912764-11-2;INT C CYBER WARFARE;;;2019;;;;;;;388;395;;;;;8;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP6HZ;WOS:000559733900046;;;;;2020-12-16;

Any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal may be defined as Al. The family of Al research is rich and varied. For example, cognitive computing is a comprehensive set of capabilities based on technologies such as deep learning, machine learning, natural language processing, reasoning and decision technologies, speech and vision technologies, human interface technologies, semantic technology, dialog and narrative generation, among other technologies. Artificial intelligence and robotics have steadily growing roles in our lives and have the potential to transform vital functions of the society. Organizations benefit from the ability of cognitive systems to improve their expertise quickly and from sharing it to all those who need it. The know-how of top experts is quickly made available to all, when their subject matter expertise is taught to a cognitive system. Through repeated use, the system will provide increasingly accurate responses, eventually eclipsing the accuracy of human experts. With artificial intelligence, comprehension can be outsourced. As the intelligence of machines improve, they will use deep learning to understand the collective information of humankind. With the use of digital sensor data, equipment based on artificial intelligence can used to develop smart advisors, teachers or assistants. As artificial intelligence technology is helping society to advance, there are risks associated with its use, found in the operating systems, hardware, algorithms, system management, ethics and liability, and privacy. The study focuses on artificial intelligence threats and risks and how Al may help to solve cyber security problems. This study uses taxonomy classification principle to classify 12 the most crucial areas of cyber security. Research method of this study was to gather 11 Al solutions that were divided into seven different categories of the crucial areas of cyber security represented in introduction chapter. Al solutions gathered uses artificial intelligence in detecting and predicting information security threats and anomalies and blocking them. The purpose of this study is to classify Al-based cyber security solutions gathered, and provide information what they can offer in solving problems in the field of cyber security.;"[Vahakainu, Petri] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Lehto, Martti] Univ Jyvaskyla, Jyvaskyla, Finland";Vahakainu, P (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland.;"petri.vahakainu@jyu.fi; martti.j.lehto@jyu.fi";;;;;;21;0;0;2;2;ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD;NR READING;CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND;2048-9870;2048-9889;978-1-912764-11-2;INT C CYBER WARFARE;;;2019;;;;;;;431;440;;;;;10;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP6HZ;WOS:000559733900051;;;;;2020-12-16;

The current paradigm of defense in depth provides measures across the tiers of a network to monitor, detect, filter, and block adversary vectors to steal, exploit, or destroy information or systems. Defense in depth is built from additional hardware and software added at key nodes and by design no individual node is trusted but is also defended and checked. Supply Chain and Financial communities over the last 5 years have been experimenting with block chain technologies to combat their trust gap between suppliers and customers. Block chain, Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence provide Big Data to commercial companies to optimize current supply chains and view real time situation reports. This paper studies the viability and benefits in cybersecurity of block chain boosted acquisitions for global computer networks and proposes military initiative to instigate block chain requirements in the invention stage of the product. Key attributes of these system of systems are developed into building a framework for a cost-effective implementation of block chain technologies across the current supply chain from material to assembly to delivery for each hardware device. Software trust is considered for an innovative twist to the block chain process that will give integrity to lines of code that come originally and continued for the lifecycle of the system. The US military demands intrinsic properties exclusive of commercial vendors that, if unrequired or unvoiced, will necessitate higher buy in cost or lack of certain securities.

The Blueprint Designer is used to design the type of questions that will be given to the students together with the possible solutions to these questions. The Blueprint Designer has a drag and drop interface for the teachers to use. This interface is similar to that of a visual programming language. Consequently it is easy to use with a low learning curve and does not require the teacher to have any prior knowledge in programming. The teacher simply selects and drags terms one by one into the question template box and creates a question template by appending these terms together. Various possible question templates are shown in this study. The Blueprint Designer therefore aims to be a very useful tool for teachers as it will allow them to easily create or amend the questions given to students, namely when the syllabus is modified or if additional exercises need to be added throughout the scholastic year.;"[Dingli, A.; Montaldo, L.

As the world of work changes, so too do the skills that workers need. In a world of thinking machines, humans must possess the ability to understand and take advantage of AI, as well as maintain their ability to compete for jobs against a talent pool of both human and robotic candidates. Therefore, individuals must be able to keep up with changes in emerging tech, make effective use of the tools of modern technology, and identify and develop skills that technology cannot replace. In this context, educators face the challenge of preparing today's students for the new world of work; enabling students to navigate their way through shifting opportunities and make decisions about what seem to be increasingly uncertain employment prospects. A number of studies have focused on predictions about job losses as robots replace human workers [1]. However, fewer research studies have investigated the perceptions and feelings of affected individuals, and their plans to navigate a future increasingly shared with technology. The aim of our research is to explore student's attitudes, perceptions and reported behaviours regarding the impact of AI on the world of work and education. The present research provides a detailed understanding of a specific set of individuals: the current generation of undergraduate students. This group of students are on the cusp of entering the workforce, they are the first generation for whom automation will definitely impact on their working lives, yet they have been educated in a system which is only just beginning to wake up to the implications of automation for the workforce. Many students are themselves not fully aware of what the future will hold. This research explores these students' visions of their futures; their awareness of how technological development may affect them; their hopes and fears; how they plan to prepare themselves for the coming changes, and; their attitudes to the impact of AI on the world of work and education. Qualitative and quantitative data will be presented from surveys, discussion groups, written work and interviews. Participants include both a general undergraduate student population studying in the UK and US (n=356), and a specific group of undergraduate students studying a Robotics, Business and Society course in the UK (n=53). The findings from this research will provide guidance for educators looking to understand and best prepare today's students for the workplace of tomorrow. Specifically, this paper explores students' thoughts and feelings about their education, work choices and the skills they feel they will need to equip themselves for this brave new world. Key findings are described using the following themes: what kinds of future students envisage in an increasingly automated work environment; how students imagine themselves in these futures; how students plan to actively respond; and what advice they have for younger students and for educators. The results and discussion focus on how to prepare students for increasing automation as well as the new challenges that AI presents for higher education more broadly.";"[Cassar, Stefania] Hult Int Business Sch, London, England; [Schofield, Carina Paine; Brown, Grace] Ashridge Hult, Berkhamsted, England";Cassar, S (corresponding author), Hult Int Business Sch, London, England.;;;;;;;22;0;0;14;14;IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT;VALENICA;LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN;2340-1079;;978-84-09-08619-1;INTED PROC;;;2019;;;;;;;3121;3129;;;;;9;"Education & Educational Research; Psychology, Educational";"Education & Educational Research; Psychology";BP0RK;WOS:000536018103035;;;;;2020-12-16;

Nowadays we see that AI and its distinct features are being applied in the growing number of areas, both in industry and services, public healthcare and education. In this article we provide an analysis of the current state of AI technologies applied in the area of language teaching. The language teaching process requires an individual approach to every participant of the language class - at the current state of educational system, it is sometimes hard or even impossible for a teacher to provide a sufficient attention and support to every member of the class. It may result in negative quality of language teaching process. We believe that a broader use of modern technologies such as AI might help improve this situation. In this article we focus our attention on investigation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Learning Analytics (LA) in education, how it is being implemented in language teaching and what possible ways for improvement exist. We observe the current problems of NLP, ML, LA and artificial intelligence in general, from the perspective of natural languages. Based on that observation, we suggest how AI can improve the quality of language teaching process and what problems the current society needs to solve in order for AI to have fruitful impact on education.;"[Petrov, E.; Mustafina, J.; Slavina, L.] Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia; [Al-Jumeily, D.; Alloghani, M.; Aljaaf, A.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been extensively used in pattern recognition and classification of data in the supervised and unsupervised environment. The ANNs use advanced concepts of computer science where a machine mimics human intelligence while learning from possible experience. To make a machine self-adaptive and autonomous, the machine is properly trained on a training data-set and then subsequently tested on new data. The excellent quality of training of ANNs typically depends on the underlying architecture of the network they employ, for a specific instance, a considerable number of deep layers, number of key nodes in each distinct layer, epoch size, and activation function. In this academic paper, the practical importance of these architectural components is carefully investigated. This paper is precisely about providing a solution that how ANNs can help us in Breast Cancer Classification.

Conventional architecture consists of multiple sensors, which work collaboratively to sense the units on road to yield a precise and safe driving strategy. Besides the precision and safety, the quickness of decision is also a major concern. In order to react quickly, the vehicle need to predict its next possible action, such as acceleration, brake and steering angle, according to its latest few actions and status. In this paper, we treat this decision-making problem as a regression problem and use deep gaussian process to predict its next action. The regression model is trained using simulation data sets and accurately captures the most significant features. Combined with rule-based method, it can be used in Torcs simulation engine to realize successful loop trip on virtual roads.

In recent years, a new AI technology called Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI) has been developed that enables similar benefits for human teams. It works by connecting networked teams into real-time systems modeled on natural swarms. Referred to commonly as human swarms or hive minds, these closed-loop systems have been shown to amplify group performance across a wide range of tasks, from financial forecasting to strategic decision-making. The current study explores the ability of ASI technology to amplify the IQ of small teams. Five small teams answered a series of questions from a commonly used intelligence test known as the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) test. Participants took the test first as individuals, and then as groups moderated by swarming algorithms (i.e. swarms). The average individual achieved 53.7% correct, while the average swarm achieved 76.7% correct, corresponding to an estimated IQ increase of 14 points. When the individual responses were aggregated by majority vote, the groups scored 56.7% correct, still 12 IQ points less than the real-time swarming method.;"[Willcox, Gregg; Rosenberg, Louis] Unanimous AI, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA";Willcox, G (corresponding author), Unanimous AI, San Francisco, CA 94115 USA.;"Gregg@Unanimous.AI; Louis@Unanimous.AI";;;National Science Foundation, NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1840937];This research study was funded in part by the National Science Foundation, NSF Award ID 1840937.

The real data for six buildings acquired by measurement meters installed in them was used in the research. Their original frequency of 1 Hz has been resampled to a frequency of 1/600 Hz which corresponds to a period of 10 minutes. Out-of-sample forecasts verified the ability of ANN to disaggregate electricity usage for its specific applications. Four categories were distinguished, which were electricity consumption by: (i) fridge, (ii) washing machine, (iii) personal computer and (iv) freezer. Both standard ANNs with multilayer perceptron architecture and newer types of networks based on deep learning approach were used. The simulations included a total of over 10,000 ANNs differing, e.g. architecture, input variables, activation functions, their parameters, and training algorithms.

BCs provide a feedback from the listener to the speaker indicating to the speaker that he is still listened to. BCs can be expressed in different ways, depending on the modality of the interaction, for example as gestures or acoustic cues. In this work, we only considered acoustic cues. We are proposing an approach towards detecting BC opportunities based on acoustic input features like power and pitch. While other works in the field rely on the use of a hand-written rule set or specialized features, we made use of artificial neural networks. They are capable of deriving higher order features from input features themselves. In our setup, we first used a fully connected feed-forward network to establish an updated baseline in comparison to our previously proposed setup. We also extended this setup by the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks which have shown to outperform feed-forward based setups on various tasks.

For instance, a humanoid robot can be perceived as a plausible tourist guide in a museum. Within this context, in this work we present how the latest findings in the field of machine learning and pattern recognition can be applied to equip a robot with sufficiently advanced perception capabilities in order to successfully guide visitors through the halls and the attraction in a museum. The challenge of running all those algorithms on a mobile, embedded platform in real time is tackled on an architectural level, where all the artificial intelligence features are tuned to run with a low computational burden and a Neural Network accelerator is included in the hardware setup. Improved robustness and predictable latency is obtained avoiding the use of cloud services in the system. Our robot, that we call MIVIABot, is able to decode and understand speech as well as extract soft biometrics from its interlocutor such as age, gender and emotional status.

A deterministic model is used to optimize arguments in evolution strategy logics, subsequently used to simulate a stochastic model.

More even, sane people may benefit from this system because it is difficult to know accurately and precisely which goods are present in the fridge every day. This system has been a wish and a major challenge for both white good companies and food distributors for decades. It is known that this system requires two things: a sensing module for food stock tracking and another actuating module for food replenishment. The last module can be easily addressed since nowadays there exist many smartphone applications for food delivering, in fact, many food distributors allow their end-users to schedule food replenishment. On the contrary, food stock tracking is not that easy since this requires artificial intelligence to determine not only the different type of goods present in the fridge but also their quantity and quality. In this work, we address the problem of food detection in the fridge by a supervised computer vision algorithm based on Fast Region-based Convolutional Network and an internet of things ecosystem architecture in the connected home for getting high performance on training and deployment of the proposed method. We have tested our method on a data set of images containing sixteen types of goods in the fridge, built with the aid of a fridge-cam. Preliminary results suggest that it is possible to detect different goods in the fridge with good accuracy and that our method may rapidly scale.;"[Lopez-Castano, Carlos; Castillo-Ossa, Luis] Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Ingn & Arquitectura, Manizales, Caldas, Colombia; [Ferrin-Bolanos, Carlos] Univ Valle, Cali, Valle Del Cauca, Colombia; [Castillo-Ossa, Luis] Univ Caldas, GITIR Grp Invest Tecnol Informac & Redes, Manizales, Colombia";Lopez-Castano, C (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Ingn & Arquitectura, Manizales, Caldas, Colombia.;caralopezcas@unal.edu.co;;"Castillo Ossa, Luis Fernando/0000-0002-2878-8229; LOPEZ CASTANO, CARLOS ALBERTO/0000-0001-8764-7496";"Universidad Nacional [36715]; Universidad de Caldas [36715]; MABE [36715]";This is a working progress being part of a research project (Computational Prototype for IoT Environments) among Colombia Institutions: Universidad Nacional, Universidad de Caldas and MABE, with code 36715.;;16;0;0;1;1;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;2194-5357;2194-5365;"978-3-319-94649-8; 978-3-319-94648-1";ADV INTELL SYST;;;2019;800;;;;;;213;220;;10.1007/978-3-319-94649-8_26;;;8;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP5UL;WOS:000558269400026;;;;;2020-12-16;

It has always been the mast important industry of modelling development, as many operations and processes here are directly empirical and provide a large amount of data for quantitative analysis, which is now well suited to the use of digital intelligent technologies. With the development of digital technologies, effective integrated modeling techniques and the introduction of new process management, knowledge and data analyst's tools are needed. Analytical models here are primarily designed to symbolize object properties in dynamics. Intelligent models and solutions based on the use of information technologies and methods of working with big data were becoming most popular, and the processes of integrated monitoring, personalization, risk management, search and generation of solutions, web orientation of programs and technologies and formation of network organizational structures of management were becoming particularly important. Mining enterprises have specific risks: mining and geological risks, risks of loss of market share and investment attractiveness due to biased valuation of useful fossil reserves, risks related to cybersecurity and innovation. Enterprises need to implement new technologies in a comprehensive manner, and information innovation is becoming very important in the face of a lack of financial resources. Expert systems, fuzzy logic, neural networks and genetic algorithms are the most relevant applications in international practice of geoinformation resource management, which largely determines the practical use of artificial intelligence methods and tools in interaction with pound-based management solutions. Modern analytical expertise includes the integration of process management systems, in particular those that are different, which is based on the development of a large number of integration technologies and techniques that apply different data models and are carried out through different procedures.

The most common definition given by cognitive science as mental capability, includes, among others, the ability to think abstract, to reason, and to solve problems from the real world. A hot topic in current AI/machine learning research is to find out whether and to what extent algorithms are able to learn abstract thinking and reasoning similarly as humans can do - or whether the learning outcome remains on purely statistical correlation. In this paper we provide some background on testing intelligence, report some preliminary results from 271 participants of our online study on explainability, and propose to use our Kandinsky Patterns as an IQ-Test for machines. Kandinsky Patterns are mathematically describable, simple, self-contained hence controllable test data sets for the development, validation and training of explainability in AI. Kandinsky Patterns are at the same time easily distinguishable from human observers. Consequently, controlled patterns can be described by both humans and computers. The results of our study show that the majority of human explanations was made based on the properties of individual elements in an image (i.e., shape, color, size) and the appearance of individual objects (number). Comparisons of elements (e.g., more, less, bigger, smaller, etc.) were significantly less likely and the location of objects, interestingly, played almost no role in the explanation of the images. The next step is to compare these explanations with machine explanations.;"[Holzinger, Andreas; Mueller, Heimo] Med Univ Graz, Auenbruggerpl 2, A-8036 Graz, Austria; [Kickmeier-Rust, Michael] Univ Teacher Educ, Notkerstr 27, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland";Holzinger, A (corresponding author), Med Univ Graz, Auenbruggerpl 2, A-8036 Graz, Austria.;"andreas.holzinger@medunigraz.at; michael.kickmeier@phsg.ch; heimo.mueller@medunigraz.at";HOLZINGER, Andreas/E-9530-2010;HOLZINGER, Andreas/0000-0002-6786-5194;"EU project FeatureCloud; EU project EOSC-Life; EU project EJP-RD; Austrian FWF Project explainable AI [P-32554]";We are grateful for interesting discussions with our local and international colleagues and their encouragement.

Moreover, corresponding characters and phrases at the same position of the two clauses are paired with each other under certain constraints of semantic and/or syntactic relatedness. Automatic couplet generation is recognized as a challenging problem even in the Artificial Intelligence field. In this paper, we comprehensively study on automatic generation of acrostic couplet with the first characters defined by users. The complete couplet generation is mainly divided into three stages, that is, antecedent clause generation pipeline, subsequent clause generation pipeline and clause re-ranker. To realize semantic and/or syntactic relatedness between two clauses, attention-based Sequence-to-Sequence (S2S) neural network is employed. Moreover, to provide diverse couplet candidates for re-ranking, a cluster-based beam search approach is incorporated into the S2S network. Both BLEU metrics and human judgments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method.

In psychology, numerous fallacies and paradoxes have shown that classical logic is not a suitable logical framework for this. In a recent paper, Eichhorn, Kern-Isberner, and Ragni have succeeded in resolving paradoxes and modelling human reasoning consistently in a non-monotonic resp. conditional logic environment with so-called inference patterns. For further studies using inference patterns, however, it is mandatory to understand better how inference patterns are triggered by the characteristics of specific examples used in the empirical tests. The goal of this paper is to categorize empirical tasks by formal inference patterns and then find crucial features of the corresponding reasoning tasks in such a way that they can be used to predict the reasoning of human subjects according to the task. To this end a large amount of psychological studies dealing with human reasoning from the literature were investigated and classified according to the observed inference patterns. From this classification, we learnt a decision tree revealing which features of empirical tasks lead to which inference pattern in most cases. These results provide insights into the reasoning modes of humans which is important for choosing the right formal model, and help setting up proper tasks for testing inference patterns.;"[Spiegel, Lars-Phillip; Kern-Isberner, Gabriele] TU Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany; [Ragni, Marco] Univ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany";Kern-Isberner, G (corresponding author), TU Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany.;gabriele.kern-isberner@cs.tu-dortmund.de;;Ragni, Marco/0000-0003-2661-2470;"DFG as part of the priority program New Frameworks of Rationality (SPP 1516) [KI1413/5-1, RA1934/2-1]; Heisenberg DFG fellowshipGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [RA1934/3-1,/4-1]";This work was possible due to the DFG-projects KI1413/5-1 to G.

Many statistical methods and traditional machine learning techniques are commonly used for forecasting time series. With the development of deep learning in artificial intelligence, many researchers have adopted new models from artificial neural networks for forecasting time series. However, poor performance of applying deep learning models in short time series hinders the accuracy in time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to alleviate this problem based on transfer learning. Existing work on transfer learning uses extracted features from a source dataset for prediction task in a target dataset. In this paper, we propose a new training strategy for time-series transfer learning with two source datasets that outperform existing approaches. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated on financial time series extracted from stock markets. Experiment results show that transfer learning based on 2 data sets is superior than other base-line methods.;"[He, Qi-Qiao; Si, Yain-Whar] Univ Macau, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China; [Pang, Patrick Cheong-Iao] Univ Melbourne, Sch Comp & Informat Syst, Parkville, Vic, Australia";Si, YW (corresponding author), Univ Macau, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China.;fstasp@umac.mo;Pang, Patrick Cheong-Iao/B-2515-2016;Pang, Patrick Cheong-Iao/0000-0002-8820-5443;Research Committee of University of Macau [MYRG2018-00246-FST];The research was funded by the Research Committee of University of Macau, Grant MYRG2018-00246-FST.;;29;1;1;1;1;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-29911-8; 978-3-030-29910-1";LECT NOTES ARTIF INT;;;2019;11671;;;;;;24;36;;10.1007/978-3-030-29911-8_3;;;13;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP5SK;WOS:000558157900003;;;;;2020-12-16;

The system is inspired by advances in biosensing wearables, tattoo displays, brain sensors, robotic agents, artificial intelligence (Al), gestural interaction and 3D holographic displays. By 2030, technological advances will enable us to prototype and investigate questions related to experiential and embodied emotional learning; emotion-based human-computer interaction, affective biosensing, empathetic Al agents, and 3D interactive holographic environments. We envision EmotoTent as a modular, emotion sensing Holodeck. In the EmotoTent program children learn and practice emotion regulation and empathy with peers, pets and a robotic dog agent in ways that are experiential, embodied and playful. We propose EmotoTent as a core element of a K-6 socio-emotional learning curriculum designed to improve school culture through the enhancement of children's ability to regulate emotions and interact with human and non-human species with empathy and compassion. Enhancing these qualities has been shown to lead to reductions in violence and bullying, racism, gender inequality and other forms of marginalization.

This paper describes how to provide kids with natural explanations, i.e., explanations verbalized in Natural Language, in the context of identifying/recognizing roles of basketball players. Semantic grounding is achieved through fuzzy concepts such as tall or short. Selected players are automatically classified by an ensemble of three different decision trees and one fuzzy rule-based classifier. All the single classifiers were first trained with the open source Weka software and then natural explanations were generated by the open source web service ExpliClas.

In the last years, several methodologies were developed to improve the accuracy of constitutive models through parameter identification and calibration methodologies. However, independently of the efficacy of the calibration methods, the accuracy of a constitutive model is always constrained to its predefined mathematical formulation. Today, artificial intelligence (AI), such as Machine-learning (ML) techniques, can be used to overpass these limitations. However, their use in the reproduction of material behaviour was not fully explored. This work proposes to model the behaviour of a metal material using ML techniques and use them in forming simulations. In this preliminary work, the ML model is defined by an artificial neural network and trained using a virtual material, whose behaviour is reproduced by a classical Chaboche-type elastoviscoplasticity model. This procedure allows evaluating the ML competence at least to replace classical models. Different ML topologies and optimization techniques are used to train the model. Then, the ML model is introduced into a finite element analysis (FEA) code, as a user subroutine, and its attainment in more complex strain states is evaluated. The replacement of classical formulations by AI techniques for the material behavior definition is analysed and discussed.;"[Gaspar, M.; Andrade-Campos, A.] Univ Aveiro, GRIDS Res Grp, Ctr Mech Technol & Automat, Dept Mech Engn, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal";Andrade-Campos, A (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, GRIDS Res Grp, Ctr Mech Technol & Automat, Dept Mech Engn, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.;gilac@ua.pt;;;"Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) by UE/FEDER through the program CENTRO 2020 [PTDC/EME-APL/29713/2017 (CENTRO-01-0145-FEDER-029713), PTDC/EMSTEC/6400/2014 (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016876), PTDC/EME-EME/31243/2017 (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-031243), PTDC/EME-EME/30592/2017 (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-030592)]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) by UE/FEDER through the program COMPETE 2020 [PTDC/EME-APL/29713/2017 (CENTRO-01-0145-FEDER-029713), PTDC/EMSTEC/6400/2014 (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016876), PTDC/EME-EME/31243/2017 (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-031243), PTDC/EME-EME/30592/2017 (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-030592)]; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/EMS/00481/2013, CENTRO-01-0145-FEDER-022083]";The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) under the projects PTDC/EME-APL/29713/2017 (CENTRO-01-0145-FEDER-029713), PTDC/EMSTEC/6400/2014 (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016876), PTDC/EME-EME/31243/2017 (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-031243) and PTDC/EME-EME/30592/2017 (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-030592) by UE/FEDER through the programs CENTRO 2020 and COMPETE 2020, and UID/EMS/00481/2013-FCT under CENTRO-01-0145-FEDER-022083.;;3;0;0;0;1;AMER INST PHYSICS;MELVILLE;2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA;0094-243X;;978-0-7354-1847-9;AIP CONF PROC;;;2019;2113;;;;;;;;120004;10.1063/1.5112659;;;6;"Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary";"Engineering; Materials Science";BP5PT;WOS:000557826700154;;;;;2020-12-16;

However, despite the artificial intelligence being drenched in our everyday life, people do not completely realize this radical change, and they have a warped perception of it.

Already installed systems, like ERTMS-ETCS, are actually distributed systems that span over geographical areas and are able to safely control large physical systems. But still, crucial decisions are taken at centralized places, that concentrate communications with mobile objects. Several prospected advances, aimed at increasing capacity and automation of rail transport, go in the direction of a more dynamic network connection among mobile components, in which decisions are actually taken in a distributed way. A concept of dynamic safety envelope within which a train can safely move then emerges, built by a fusion of reliable information coming from the infrastructure and from other trains, as well as autonomously harvested by on-board intelligent sensors.

In this paper, we propose to add and optimize both dilated convolution (DC) and attention mechanisms to improve the SSD network structure, and we call it DC-Attention-SSD. The experimental results show that the DC-Attention-SSD on the ImageNet dataset achieves an accuracy of detection up to 99.4%, which is significantly higher than SSD.

As DNN models become increasingly complex, the large amount of data generated during network computations exerts substantial pressure on the capacity and bandwidth of the memory subsystem. Consequently, memory hierarchy is quickly becoming a major bottleneck for DNN performance scaling. Optimizing the memory subsystem for DNN workloads requires a detailed understanding of the memory access behavior and the complex interactions between the processor and the memory hierarchy. Unfortunately, most of the existing memory profiling studies for DNNs rely either on high level software understanding of individual DNN layers or on analytical models. These approaches do not capture the complex feedback loop between the processor and the memory subsystem. To address this challenge, we have developed a simulation infrastructure, DLsim, which carries out detailed memory profiling of DNN workloads in a full-system simulation environment. In this paper, we report the key findings from our memory characterization analysis of five popular DNNs implemented in the widely used TensorFlow framework. Based on these findings, we identify multiple memory system optimization opportunities tailored for DNNs.;"[Chishti, Zeshan] Intel Labs, Hillsboro, OR 97123 USA; [Akin, Berkin] Google, Menlo Pk, CA USA";Chishti, Z (corresponding author), Intel Labs, Hillsboro, OR 97123 USA.;"zeshan.a.chishti@intel.com; bakin@google.com";;;;;;23;0;0;0;0;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA;;;978-1-4503-7206-0;;;;2019;;;;;;;497;505;;10.1145/3357526.3357569;;;9;Computer Science, Theory & Methods;Computer Science;BP5OP;WOS:000557305400044;;;;;2020-12-16;

The proposed method is based on an advanced IM model, which is developed using magnetically coupled multiple circuits approach. The developed squirrel-cage IM model is directly applied to the numerous computer simulations, with healthy and faulty rotor bars, in order to effectively extract the most relevant BRB feature components from the motor current and speed spectra. Thus generated discriminative BRB features are used to train an intelligent FD system based on an artificial intelligence, such as artificial neural network and support-vector machine. Finally, the method is tested and verified with BRB features obtained from additional computer simulations of the FM with healthy and faulty rotor bars. The classification results show that the proposed method can identify BRB fault with good accuracy.;"[Reljic, Dejan; Jerkan, Dejan; Kanovic, Zeljko] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Novi Sad, Serbia";Reljic, D (corresponding author), Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Novi Sad, Serbia.;"reljic@uns.ac.rs; dejan.jerkan@uns.ac.rs; kanovic@uns.ac.rs";;;Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [III42004];This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia under project III42004.;;14;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-5386-9301-8;;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;6;Engineering, Electrical & Electronic;Engineering;BP5KJ;WOS:000556109600059;;;;;2020-12-16;

Using distributed deep learning (DDL), a data scientist can harness the computational power of multiple graphics processing units (GPUs) spread across different machines and significantly reduce neural network training times. In this paper, we focus on a TensorFlow based distributed training approach, which, unfortunately, leaves the auxiliary modeling capabilities (e.g., resource deployment, data distribution, run-time control etc.) to user-discretion. Additionally, these training capabilities cannot be accessed directly through popular high-level interfaces such as Keras. As a result, the transition to DDL from a single node training setting involves a steep learning curve for data scientists. To bridge this gap, we present EasyDist, an end-to-end DDL tool that preserves the single-node programming model by leveraging distributed TensorFlow between a Keras interface and public Cloud infrastructure. EasyDist is model agnostic, i.e., any neural network model written in Keras can use EasyDist for distributed training. Internally, EasyDist incorporates resource deployment, data allocation, training orchestration and result aggregation within a clean abstraction which allows the data scientist to focus on model definition. Evaluation of EasyDist on publicly available benchmark datasets and models shows that the model accuracy is not compromised in any significant way while the training times can be reduced upto similar to 6-8x compared to single machine settings.;"[Natu, Varun; Ghosh, Rahul] Amer Express Big Data Labs, New York, NY 10281 USA";Natu, V (corresponding author), Amer Express Big Data Labs, New York, NY 10281 USA.;"varun.u.natu1@aexp.com; rahul.ghosh@aexp.com";;;;;;19;0;0;0;0;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA;;;978-1-4503-6207-8;;;;2019;;;;;;;265;268;;10.1145/3297001.3297037;;;4;Computer Science, Theory & Methods;Computer Science;BP5OG;WOS:000557252800036;;;;;2020-12-16;

Our team, Communities Artificial Intelligence (AI), at LinkedIn helps our members achieve this goal is by providing a platform where communities can form around common interests and shared experiences. Fostering active communities at LinkedIn can be broken down into the following components: (1) Discover: Help members find new entities (members, companies, hashtags, and more) to follow that will expose them to communities that share their interests. (2) Engage: Engage members in the conversations taking place in their communities by recommending content from their areas of interest. (3) Contribute: Help members effectively engage with the right communities when they create or share content. These three components form the main pillars of a content-driven ecosystem and our goal is to use AI to successfully close the loop between Discover (via providing relevant follow recommendations), Engage (via delivering engaging content to users from their areas of interest), and Contribute (via suggesting hashtags to content creators to target the right audience). A diverse set of AI techniques is required to address the challenges that arise in each of these components. These techniques include: Supervised Learning (XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression), Wide and Deep Models, Natural Language Processing (e.g., Word Embeddings, ngram matching), and Unsupervised Learning. In this presentation, we will provide an overview of the AI techniques we use to form active communities on LinkedIn. We will describe two solutions in detail. First, we will describe how we have built our Follow Recommendations product. The goal of the Follow Recommendations product is to recommend entities to a member that the member finds both immediately relevant (i.e., increase the probability the member will follow the recommended entity) as well as engaging in the long run (i.e., the recommended entity produces content that the member finds relevant). Our analysis of the performance of our follow recommendations models has shown the superiority of nonlinear models compared to their linear counterparts. To manage the explosion of data emanating from terabytes of features generated from (viewer, entity) pairs, we use an innovative 2-D hash join algorithm that was developed at LinkedIn. We are also moving towards a hybrid scoring architecture. This allows us to score candidates with complex offline models and then re-rank these candidates based on more time-sensitive contextual features online. This generates more relevant and timely recommendations for the members based on their recent activity on different parts of the LinkedIn ecosystem. Second, we will describe our approach to solve the problem of Hashtag Suggestion and Typeahead. Hashtags are a great tool that allows members to expand the reach of their posts to the right audience (or communities). Our Hashtag Suggestion and Typeahead (HST) product was built to aid members in adding hashtags to their posts. We do not only recommend hashtags that the member is likely to select into their post, but also hashtags that are more likely to get the member the most online feedback. We call the latter aspect downstream utility (or engagement). However, before realizing this utility, the member has to actually select from the recommended hashtags. Therefore, the HST product is produced by combining two models. The first model maximizes the probability that the member will select the suggested hashtag and the second one optimizes for downstream utility. Based on content consumption behavior on LinkedIn, we have a good understanding of the supply and demand of content tagged with a specific hashtag. This information enables us to shape the inventory as well as traffic in individual hashtag domains, thus providing a better experience to content-starved communities.;"[Al-Qawasmeh, Abdulla; Saha, Ankan] Linkedin, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA";Al-Qawasmeh, A (corresponding author), Linkedin, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.;"aalqawasmeh@linkedin.com; asaha@linkedin.com.com";;;;;;0;0;0;0;0;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA;;;978-1-4503-6243-6;;;;2019;;;;;;;521;521;;10.1145/3298689.3346976;;;1;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Operations Research & Management Science";"Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science";BP5OJ;WOS:000557263400079;;;;;2020-12-16;

Among them, recent video encoding techniques exploit in large-scale machine learning algorithms, either to aid in compression efficiency or to reduce computational cost. However, this is not a simple task, especially if the objective is to reduce computational cost, since it is necessary that the machine learning algorithm used does not interfere negatively in the total coding process time and in compression efficiency. As video transrating is an essential task in streaming service providers that need to transmit and deliver different versions of the same content for a multitude of users operating under different network conditions, it is critical to find an efficient strategy that yields computational cost reduction with small loss in compression efficiency. This work discusses the use of different machine learning algorithms in the video transcoding concept, comparing them in terms of accuracy and overhead processing time.

Flash memory has migrated to 3D NAND in the past five years leveraging atomic layer deposition and plasma etching to overcome lithography scaling limitations. The 3D NAND implementation has increased memory cell density and reduced chip sizes, but also faces another technology pivot in continuous layer scaling. To further increase bandwidth, through silicon via (TSV) interconnect technology is considered for 3D NAND. In addition to typical TSV integration, the process and device complexity of 3D NAND memory array structures is briefed for its increased risks of TSV integration with 3D NAND chips. Analysis is then conducted for chip stacking using TSV integration compared against wirebond chip stacking on performance, power, area and cost. The power consumption reduction and performance improvement by adoption of TSV technology have trade-offs on chip size increase, yield loss, cost increase, and time-to-market risk increase. The implementation of TSV technology on packaging of stacked 3D NAND chips is therefore deemed to be application oriented decision. This study will also present surveyed results in recent patent filings in 3D NAND and TSV areas since 2014.

Abnormal vital signs help to alert medical practitioners to potential health problems. Effective and long-range early prediction of vital signs may prevent adverse health outcomes and reduce cost. In this paper, we suggest a new approach called generative boosting, in order to effectively perform long-range early prediction of vital signs. Generative boosting consists of a generative model, to generate synthetic data for the next few time steps, and a predictive model, to directly make long-range predictions based on observed and generated data. We explore generative boosting via long short-term memory (LSTM) for both the predictive and generative models, leading to a scheme called generative LSTM (GLSTM). Our experiments indicate that GLSTM outperforms a diverse range of strong benchmark models, with and without generative boosting. As expected, the results also indicate that more accurately generated data leads to more accurate long-range predictions. In light of this, we use a mutual information based clustering algorithm to select a more representative dataset to train the generative model. This leads to significantly improved accuracy of the long-range prediction of high variation vital signs such as heart rate and systolic blood pressure. Overall, our best results indicate that the proposed method is able to predict heart rate and systolic blood pressure 20 minutes in advance, with a mean absolute percentage error of 7.41% and 6.17%, respectively.;"[Liu, Shiyu; Yao, Jia; Motani, Mehul] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Singapore, Singapore";Liu, SY (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Singapore, Singapore.;"shiyu_liu@u.nus.edu; yao.jia@u.nus.edu; motani@nus.edu.sg";;;"National Research Foundation Singapore under its AI Singapore ProgrammeSingapore National Research Foundation [AISG-GC-2019-002]; Singapore Ministry of EducationMinistry of Education, Singapore [WBS R-263-000-D35-114, WBS R-263-000-D64-114]";This research was supported by the National Research Foundation Singapore under its AI Singapore Programme (Award Number: AISG-GC-2019-002) and by the Singapore Ministry of Education under grants WBS R-263-000-D35-114 and WBS R-263-000-D64-114.;;47;1;1;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2156-1125;2156-1133;978-1-7281-1867-3;IEEE INT C BIOINFORM;;;2019;;;;;;;437;444;;;;;8;"Biochemical Research Methods; Mathematical & Computational Biology";"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Mathematical & Computational Biology";BP5JS;WOS:000555804900076;;;;;2020-12-16;

We propose Pyramid GAN(Py-GAN) for blind image inpainting to remove cross symbols. Py-GAN contains a generator with pyramid structure and a global discriminator. The global discriminator improves the authenticity of the corrupted regions and image consistency. The generator uses the joint context loss to get clear image restoration, which prevents the information loss of non-completion area. The inpainting results of the proposed Py-GAN not only maintains the texture and structural information of the original image, but also has the greatest advantage that there are no artifacts in the corrupted regions, achieving pixel-level realism.

With the present contribution, an attempt was made to first develop an ensemble deep learning text classification component and then integrate it with rule-based named entity recognition to categorize free-text PPMs submitted under the Non-Urgent Medical Question subject in the patient portal as either containing active symptom descriptions or logistical requests (e.g., appointment rescheduling).;"[Tafti, Ahmad P.; Fu, Sunyang; Liu, Hongfang] Mayo Clin, Dept Hlth Sci Res, Rochester, MN 55905 USA; [Khurana, Aditya; Mastorakos, George M.] Mayo Clin, Alix Sch Med, Scottsdale, AZ USA; [Poole, Kenneth G.] Mayo Clin, Div Community Internal Med, Scottsdale, AZ USA; [Traub, Stephen J.] Mayo Clin, Dept Emergency Med, Phoenix, AZ USA; [Yiannias, James A.] Mayo Clin, Dept Dermatol, Scottsdale, AZ USA";Tafti, AP (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Dept Hlth Sci Res, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.;"tafti.ahmad@mayo.edu; fu.sunyang@mayo.edu; khurana.aditya@mayo.edu; mastorakos.george@mayo.edu; poole.kenneth@mayo.edu; traub.stephen@mayo.edu; yiannias.j@mayo.edu; liu.hongfang@mayo.edu";;;;;;41;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2156-1125;2156-1133;978-1-7281-1867-3;IEEE INT C BIOINFORM;;;2019;;;;;;;1380;1387;;;;;8;"Biochemical Research Methods; Mathematical & Computational Biology";"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Mathematical & Computational Biology";BP5JS;WOS:000555804900258;;;;;2020-12-16;

However, much of the current XAI-Research is focused on machine learning practitioners and engineers while omitting the specific needs of end-users. In this paper, we examine the impact of virtual agents within the field of XAI on the perceived trustworthiness of autonomous intelligent systems. To assess the practicality of this concept, we conducted a user study based on a simple speech recognition task.

First, our problem is to explore the way how user experience is delivered with divergent key multimedia elements. Second, we treat understanding as to elucidate their causal implications in driving user responses. Third, we propose to understand content based on observational audience visit logs. To approach this problem, we measure and generate heterogeneous content features and model them as binary, multivalued or continuous genres. Multiple key performance indicators (KPIs) are introduced to quantify user responses. We then develop a flexible and adaptive doubly robust estimator to identify the causality between these features and user responses from observational data. The comprehensive experiments are performed on real-world data sets. We show that the further analysis of the experimental results can shed actionable insights on how to improve KPIs.

We tested the RESOLVEDD strategy in a multiple case study of five student projects where the use of ethical tools was given as one of the design requirements.

The unique capacity of deep learning models to automatically learn patterns from the data differentiates it from other machine learning techniques. Deep learning is responsible for a significant number of recent breakthroughs in AI. However, deep learning models are highly dependent on the underlying data. So, consistency, accuracy, and completeness of data is essential for a deep learning model. Thus, data management principles and practices need to be adopted throughout the development process of deep learning models. The objective of this study is to identify and categorise data management challenges faced by practitioners in different stages of end-to-end development. In this paper, a case study approach is employed to explore the data management issues faced by practitioners across various domains when they use real-world data for training and deploying deep learning models.

This approach has shown improved performance, particularly in the domain of artificial intelligence, in which computationally demanding models must be trained and executed. However, these computational environments pose various challenges to software engineering, since applications must be designed and developed differently while accounting for target hardware architectures that are inherently different. Companies interested in migrating to heterogeneous platforms must be aware of the changes to the software development processes that are required to accommodate such solution. In this paper, we conducted a multiple case study that aims to discover the challenges and common practices when developing software for heterogeneous platforms in industrial contexts. First, we organized semi-structured interviews with companies on the automotive, automation, and telecommunication domains. Then, we analyzed and structured the data in order to create a classification describing the software engineering challenges faced by companies using heterogeneous platforms. The companies involved in this study are in different stages of maturity concerning the use of heterogeneous platforms.

However, neglecting NFRs during prioritization phase may lead to inaccurate estimations for software projects resulting in high maintenance cost and failures. The subjective and uncertain nature of non-functional requirements makes them unfit to be prioritized using conventional prioritization methods. Although the existing literature reports on inadequate consideration given to NFRs prioritization, still no comprehensive systematic effort has been done to report the limitations and evaluation mechanisms of existing NFRs prioritization approaches. Requirements engineering society lacks a broad understanding of NFRs prioritization approaches and the challenges which need to be overcome. Therefore, we aim to investigate (i) the existing NFR prioritization techniques and their validation mechanisms, (ii) the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in NFRs prioritization, and (iii) the limitations of existing NFRs prioritization techniques. For this, we reviewed the literature published from 2008 till present and extracted 30 studies. The results reveal twenty-five NFRs prioritization techniques out of which only three are AI based. The major limitations we have come across are that most of the NFRs prioritization techniques are not scalable to large datasets, interdependencies between functional requirements (FRs) and NFRs are ignored, and the uncertainties associated with NFRs are not considered at all. However, the literature suggests that AI-based techniques and Fuzzy logic may be used to solve issues such as uncertainties i.e. ambiguities, vagueness, and subjective opinions of stakeholders. This review adds to the existing body of knowledge on NFRs and motivates the practitioners to focus on the NFR prioritization by highlighting the limitations of the existing methods.;"[Ijaz, Khush Bakht; Inayat, Irum] Natl Univ Comp & Emerging Sci NUCES, Software Engn & Automat Lab SEAL, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Bukhsh, Faiza Allah] Univ Twente UT, Fac Elect Engn Math & Comp Sci EEMCS, Datamanagement & Bioinformat, Enchede, Netherlands";Ijaz, KB (corresponding author), Natl Univ Comp & Emerging Sci NUCES, Software Engn & Automat Lab SEAL, Islamabad, Pakistan.;"i171097@nu.edu.pk; irum.inayat@nu.edu.pk; f.a.bukhsh@utwente.nl";;;;;;44;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;1089-6503;;978-1-7281-3421-5;EUROMICRO CONF PROC;;;2019;;;;;;;379;386;;10.1109/SEAA.2019.00064;;;8;"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP5JG;WOS:000555692900055;;;;;2020-12-16;

One of the most crucial problems in mobile crowdsensing is the injection of fake sensing tasks to clog the energy, computing, storage and sensing resources of participating devices.

However, the rapid increase in research article submissions these days across different fields is posing significant challenges to the current system. Hence the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to better streamline the existing peer review system is an immediate need in this age of rapid scientific progress. Among many, one particular challenge these days is that the journal editors and conference program chairs are overwhelmed with the ever-increasing rise in article submissions. Studies show that a lot many submissions are not well-informed and do not fit within the scope of the intended journal or conference. Here in this work, we embark on to investigate how an AI could assist the editors and program chairs to identify potential out-of-scope submissions based on the past accepted papers of the particular journal or conference. We design a multimodal deep neural architecture and investigate the role of every possible channel of information in a research article (full-text, bibliography, images) to determine its appropriateness to the concerned venue. Our approach does not involve any handcrafted features, solely depends on the past accepting activity of the venue, and thereby achieves significant performance on two real-life datasets.

The main difficulty is that the deep neural network easily overfit small-sample data and has big variance. Ensemble learning is a good way to overcome overfilling and reduce the variance of the model; however, the existing ensemble methods based on deep neural network still could overlit on small-sample image data due to the big randomness of deep neural network.

In parallel, quality of experience (QoE) has been dealt with and discussed from both academy and industry to grade consumer products from the quality perspective. However, for quantification of QoE, it is very challengeable to analyze the human perception more accurately, even if it has been studied in many decades. Currently, there is no solid methodology to verify human perception as a closed-form objectively due to the limitation of human perception analysis. Recently, the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has emerged as a core technology while breaking most performance records in the area of artificial intelligence via intensive training in accordance with the massive dataset. The main motivation of this paper lies in finding new insight into human perception analysis for QoE evaluation through visualization of intermediate node values. This new QoE assessment approach enables us to figure out the human visual sensitivity without using any prior knowledge. Toward the end, we provide a novel clue of how to obtain visual sensitivity, which is expected to be essentially applied for future QoE applications. In addition, we discuss future applications in QoE assessment with respect to the display types.;"[Kim, Woojae; Kim, Jaekyung; Lee, Sanghoon] Yonsei Univ, Seoul, South Korea";Kim, W (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Seoul, South Korea.;"wooyoa@yonsei.ac.kr; jkkproject@yonsei.ac.kr; slee@yonsei.ac.kr";;;Samsung Research Funding Center of Samsung Electronics [SRFC-IT1702-08];This work was supported by Samsung Research Funding Center of Samsung Electronics under Project Number SRFC-IT1702-08;;24;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2309-9402;;978-1-7281-3248-8;ASIAPAC SIGN INFO PR;;;2019;;;;;;;1556;1559;;;;;4;"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology";"Computer Science; Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology";BP5JO;WOS:000555696900263;;;;;2020-12-16;

Furthermore, the data needed for building such models may be unstructured (e.g., text, image, and video). Hence such data may be stored in different data management systems ranging from relational databases to newer NoSQL databases tailored for storing unstructured data. Furthermore, data scientists are increasingly using programming languages such as Python, R etc. to process data using many existing libraries. In some cases, the developed code will be automatically executed by the NoSQL system on the stored data. These developments indicate the need for a data security and privacy solution that can uniformly protect data stored in many different data management systems and enforce security policies even if sensitive data is processed using a data scientist submitted complex program. In this paper, we introduce our vision for building such a solution for protecting big data. Specifically, our proposed SECUREDL system allows organizations to 1) enforce policies that control access to sensitive data, 2) keep necessary audit logs automatically for data governance and regulatory compliance, 3) sanitize and redact sensitive data on-the-fly based on the data sensitivity and AI model needs, 4) detect potentially unauthorized or anomalous access to sensitive data, 5) automatically create attribute-based access control policies based on data sensitivity and data type.;"[Kantarcioglu, Murat; Shaon, Fahad] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Kantarcioglu, Murat; Shaon, Fahad] Data Secur Technol LLC, Dallas, TX 75252 USA";"Kantarcioglu, M (corresponding author), Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.; Kantarcioglu, M (corresponding author), Data Secur Technol LLC, Dallas, TX 75252 USA.";"muratk@utdallas.edu; fahad.shaon@utdallas.edu";;;"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [1R01HG006844]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CICI-1547324, IIS-1633331, SBIR-1647681, SBIR-1758628]";The research reported herein was supported in part by NIH award 1R01HG006844, NSF awards CICI-1547324, IIS-1633331, SBIR-1647681, and SBIR-1758628.;;3;1;1;1;1;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-6741-1;;;;2019;;;;;;;218;220;;10.1109/TPS-ISA48467.2019.00035;;;3;Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence;Computer Science;BP5GD;WOS:000555456700026;;;;;2020-12-16;

However, due to the lack of scrutinizing, both clean and dirty data are widely spreaded. For instance, there is a significant portion of images tagged with corrupted dirty class labels. Such dirty data sets are not only detrimental to the learning outcomes, e.g., misclassified images into the wrong classes, but also costly. It is pointed out that bad data can cost the U.S. up to a daunting 3 trillion dollars per year. In this paper, we address the following question: how prevailing (deep) machine learning models can be robustly trained given a non-negligible presence of corrupted labeled data. Dirty labels significantly increase the complexity of existing learning problems, as the ground truth of label's quality are not easily assessed. Here, we advocate to rigorously incorporate human experts into one learning framework where both artificial and human intelligence collaborate. To such an end, we combine three strategies to enhance the robustness for deep and regular machine learning algorithms, namely, (i) data filtering through additional quality model, (ii) data selection via actively learning from expert, and (iii) imitating expert's correction process. We demonstrate three strategies sequentially with examples and apply them on widely used benchmarks, such as CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Our initial results show the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in combating dirty labels, e.g., the resulting classification can be up to 50% higher than the state-of-the-art AI-only solutions.

Such platforms typically use separate models for each modality of monitoring data (e.g., textual properties and real-valued response time in logs and traces) to detect faults and upcoming anomalies in cloud services, which do not capture the existing correlation between the modalities. This paper extends the range of utilized data types for creation of a single model to improve the anomaly detection. We use a bimodal distributed tracing data from large cloud infrastructures in order to detect an anomaly in the execution of system components. We propose an anomaly detection method, which utilizes a single modality of the data with information about the trace structure. In the next step, we extend the single-modality neural architecture to a multimodal neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) to enable the learning from the sequential nature of both modalities in the tracing data. Furthermore, we demonstrate an approach to detect dependent and concurrent events using the ability of the model to reconstruct the execution path.

Enforcing compliance is a complex process, which involves following regulatory requirements coming from many, often overlapping sources, and mapping those requirements against a controls framework that implements them on the ground. In this paper, we propose a solution for streamlining the process of analyzing, monitoring and enforcing compliance in the cloud. We rely on text classification methodologies to match both regulatory requirements and controls against a common hierarchy. Finally, we explain how to use the text classification techniques to analyze the regulatory requirements, and match them to executable code that enforces these requirements in the cloud infrastructure components, such as in virtual machines and containers.;"[Adam, Constantin; Bulut, Muhammed Fatih; Hernandez, Milton; Vukovic, Maja] IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA";Adam, C (corresponding author), IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA.;"cmadam@us.ibm.com; mfbulut@us.ibm.com; miltonh@us.ibm.com; maja@us.ibm.com";;;;;;25;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2159-6182;;978-1-7281-2705-7;IEEE INT CONF CLOUD;;;2019;;;;;;;234;242;;10.1109/CLOUD.2019.00049;;;9;"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP5LY;WOS:000556208000036;;;;;2020-12-16;

However, when ANN-based Network Functions (NFs) want to take advantage of the elasticity of NFV, our study finds that huge gaps exist between the existing approaches and the ideal goals for the elasticity control of ANN-based NFs. By revealing the key differences between ANN-based NFs and traditional NFs, we propose LEGO, an innovative framework that provides systematic mechanisms for traffic splitting, instance partition and runtime management to enable correct and efficient scaling of ANN-based NFs.

The absence of a standardized method to quantify the severity of DP is problematic, being the severity of the condition the main factor for the recommendation of a specific treatment. To improve the quality of assessment of DP and thanks to the recent emergence of novel software solutions to process point-clouds, 3D surface acquisition of the infant's head is performed. Although these strategies proved their added-value, they have high costs and require medical training to learn how to correctly manipulate the geometry acquisition system and the software. However, no 3D synthetic and realistic models are currently available, hampering the development of novel methods. In this sense, the future purpose of this work is to generate an artificial benchmark of 3D models of infant heads with deformational plagiocephaly and make it freely available to potentiate the development of these novel methods. Thus, a selection of the best parameters that characterize plagiocephaly is here performed. To create a parametric model of the head with DP, measurements retrieved from state-of-the-art studies and 40 clinical magnetic resonance images of infant heads (33 with normal shape and 7 with mild deformity) were extracted and evaluated. We expect to apply these parameters in a future work on an artificial intelligence framework to generate the models.;"[Veloso, Fernando; Torres, Helena R.; Oliveira, Bruno; Morais, Pedro; Vilaca, Joao L.] Polytech Inst Cavado & Ave, 2Ai, Barcelos, Portugal; [Veloso, Fernando; Gomes-Fonseca, Joao; Correia-Pinto, Jorge] Univ Minho, Sch Med, Life & Hlth Sci Res Inst ICVS, Braga, Portugal; [Veloso, Fernando; Gomes-Fonseca, Joao; Correia-Pinto, Jorge] ICVS 3Bs PT Govt Associate Lab, Braga, Portugal; [Veloso, Fernando; Pinho, Antonio C.

At present, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones do not have long flight times and are mainly used for monitoring, surveillance, and image post-processing. On the other hand, the traditional airship is too large and not easy to take off and land. Therefore, we propose to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Drone-Cruiser base station that can help 5G mobile communication systems and beyond quickly recover the network after a disaster and handle the instant communications by the flash crowd. The drone-cruiser base station can overcome the communications problem for three types of flash crowds, such as in stadiums, parades, and large plaza so that an appropriate number of aerial base stations can be accurately deployed to meet large and dynamic traffic demands. Artificial intelligence can solve these problems by analyzing the collected data, and then adjust the system parameters in the framework of Self-Organizing Network (SON) to achieve the goals of self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing. With the help of AI technologies, 5G networks can become more intelligent. This paper aims to provide a new type of service, On-Demand Aerial Base Station as a Service.

This has resulted in a growing interest in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) which communicate through binary activations or 'spikes', as they offer a bio-plausible and energy efficient alternative to traditional deep neural networks (DNNs). In this work, we present deep spiking neural networks with binary stochastic activations that are tailored for implementation on emerging hardware platforms. We evaluate two deep neural network models, VGG-9 and VGG-16 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, respectively, with binary stochastic activations. We achieve state of the accuracy and achieve 1.4x improvement in energy consumption because of spike-based communication versus a network with ReLU neurons.

One cause of this decline is that users tend not to engage with diverse, idea-challenging content that contrasts their prior opinions. However, they do tend to engage with content endorsed by their social connections, even if it goes against their personal opinion. Thus, by increasing the diversity of opinion in a user's social network, they will likely engage with more diverse content. We are developing a cyber argumentation system with social networking and present a social connection recommendation re-ranking method that promotes opinion diversity. We use artificial intelligence and data mining techniques to mine and analyze user opinions from argumentation data on important issues, then use furthest opinion distance to re-rank the recommendations. Our method is designed to easily integrate with existing social connection recommenders, which preserves platform specific criteria. We compare the opinion diversity of recommendations from five types of social connection recommendation methods, with and without our re-ranking method, on a large empirical dataset.

To date, the advent of big data driven applications opens up many frontiers in artificial intelligence and computer science, and yet it also raises a series of challenges due to theirs empirical and experimental nature. In particular, to systematically and analytically understand the logical connection through which intelligence and knowledge is derived from data and information deterministically is one of the far-reaching future objectives in computer science. Starting from an earlier result on Dimensional Situation Analytics (DSA), where the initial efforts targeted at the integration of situations and DIKW ontology, this paper brings the prospect of real world applications of DSA into perspective. A good example is UAV path planning for efficient radiation detection and monitoring, which links the pervious result, i.e., the DSA formal framework, with real world experimentation and thereof further explores on the effectiveness and future work for the DSA.;"[Ming, Hua] Oakland Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Rochester, MI 48309 USA; [Oyama, Katsunori] Nihon Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Koriyama, Fukushima, Japan";Ming, H (corresponding author), Oakland Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Rochester, MI 48309 USA.;"ming@oakland.edu; oyama.katsunori@nihon-u.ac.jp";;;;;;4;0;0;0;0;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA;2378-3818;;978-1-7281-3851-0;IEEE WORLD CONGR SER;;;2019;;;;;;;133;134;;10.1109/SERVICES.2019.00036;;;2;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP5LU;WOS:000556201200021;;;;;2020-12-16;

For all to enjoy the benefits provided by safe, ethical and trustworthy AI systems, it is crucial to incentivise participants with appropriate strategies that ensure mutually beneficial normative behaviour and safety-compliance from all parties involved. Little attention has been given to understanding the dynamics and emergent behaviours arising from this AI bidding war, and moreover, how to influence it to achieve certain desirable outcomes (e.g. AI for public good and participant compliance). To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a research agenda to develop theoretical models that capture key factors of the AI race, revealing which strategic behaviours may emerge and hypothetical scenarios therein. Strategies from incentive and agreement modelling are directly applicable to systematically analyse how different types of incentives (namely, positive vs. negative, peer vs. institutional, and their combinations) influence safety-compliant behaviours over time, and how such behaviours should be configured to ensure desired global outcomes, studying at the same time how these mechanisms influence AI development. This agenda will provide actionable policies, showing how they need to be employed and deployed in order to achieve compliance and thereby avoid disasters as well as loosing confidence and trust in AI in general.;"[Han, The Anh] Teesside Univ, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England; [Pereira, Luis Moniz] Univ Nova Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal; [Lenaerts, Tom] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Lenaerts, Tom] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium";Han, TA (corresponding author), Teesside Univ, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England.;"t.han@tees.ac.uk; lmp@fct.unl.pt; tlenaert@ulb.ac.be";"Lenaerts, Tom/B-6376-2008; Han, The Anh/G-1674-2011";"Lenaerts, Tom/0000-0003-3645-1455; Han, The Anh/0000-0002-3095-7714";Future of Life Institute [RFP2-154];All authors of this work are supported by Future of Life Institute (grant RFP2-154).

This dual objective can be summarized by the concept of productive laziness. Existing scheduling approaches mostly focus on efficiency but overlook worker wellbeing through proper rest. In order to enable workforce management systems to follow the IEEE Ethically Aligned Design guidelines to prioritize worker wellbeing, we propose a distributed Computational Productive Laziness (CPL) approach in this paper. It intelligently recommends personalized work-rest schedules based on local data concerning a worker's capabilities and situational factors to incorporate opportunistic resting and achieve superlinear collective productivity without the need for explicit coordination messages. Extensive experiments based on a real-world dataset of over 5,000 workers demonstrate that CPL enables workers to spend 70% of the effort to complete 90% of the tasks on average, providing more ethically aligned scheduling than existing approaches.;"[Yu, Han; Miao, Chunyan; Fauvol, Simon] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore; [Zheng, Yongqing; Cui, Lizhen] Shandong Univ, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Leung, Cyril] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada";Yu, H (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore.;"han.yu@ntu.cdu.sg; ascymiao@ntu.cdu.sg; yongqingzhcng@darcway.com.cn; clz@sdu.cdu.sg; sfauvcl@ntu.cdu.sg; clcung@ccc.ubc.ca";Miao, Chunyan/A-3730-2011;Miao, Chunyan/0000-0002-0300-3448;"Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Assistant Professorship (NAP)Nanyang Technological University; National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its IDM Futures Funding InitiativeSingapore National Research Foundation";This research is supported, in part, by Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Assistant Professorship (NAP) and the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore under its IDM Futures Funding Initiative.;;35;1;1;0;0;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA;;;978-1-4503-6324-2;;;;2019;;;;;;;45;51;;10.1145/3306618.3314240;;;7;Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence;Computer Science;BP5KP;WOS:000556121100008;;;;;2020-12-16;

However, as many of these systems are opaque in their operation, there is a growing demand for such systems to provide explanations for their decisions. Conventional approaches to this problem attempt to expose or discover the inner workings of a machine learning model with the hope that the resulting explanations will be meaningful to the consumer. In contrast, this paper suggests a new approach to this problem. It introduces a simple, practical framework, called Teaching Explanations for Decisions (TED), that provides meaningful explanations that match the mental model of the consumer.

There is substantial overlap between different sets of principles, with widespread agreement that AI should be used for the common good, should not be used to harm people or undermine their rights, and should respect widely held values such as fairness, privacy, and autonomy. While articulating and agreeing on principles is important, it is only a starting point. Drawing on comparisons with the field of bioethics, we highlight some of the limitations of principles: in particular, they are often too broad and high-level to guide ethics in practice. We suggest that an important next step for the field of AI ethics is to focus on exploring the tensions that inevitably arise as we try to implement principles in practice. By explicitly recognising these tensions, we can begin to make decisions about how they should be resolved in specific cases, and develop frameworks and guidelines for AI ethics that are rigorous and practically relevant.

Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms exist that can outperform humans at learning such tasks. Thus, there is an opportunity for AI agents to assist people in learning these tasks more effectively. In this work, we use a multi-armed bandit as a controlled setting in which to explore this direction. We pair humans with a selection of agents and observe how well each human-agent team performs. We find that team performance can beat both human and agent performance in isolation. Interestingly, we also find that an agent's performance in isolation does not necessarily correlate with the human-agent team's performance. A drop in agent performance can lead to a disproportionately large drop in team performance, or in some set tings can even improve team performance. Pairing a human with an agent that performs slightly better than them can make them perform much better, while pairing them with an agent that performs the same can make them them perform much worse. Further, our results suggest that people have different exploration strategies and might perform better with agents that match their strategy. Overall, optimizing human-agent team performance requires going beyond optimizing agent performance, to understanding how the agent's suggestions will influence human decision-making.;"[Pandya, Ravi; Huang, Sandy H.; Hadfield-Menell, Dylan; Dragan, Anca D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA";Pandya, R (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;"ravi.pandya@berkeley.edu; shhuang@berkeley.edu; dhm@eecs.berkeley.edu; anca@berkeley.edu";;;NSF NR;This work was partially supported by the NSF NR.

Only recently has significant attention turned to a potentially more alarming problem: the use of AI/ML to influence our decision-making. The contexts in which we make decisions what behavioral economists call our choice architectures are increasingly technologically-laden. Which is to say: algorithms increasingly determine, in a wide variety of contexts, both the sets of options we choose from and the way those options are framed. Moreover, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) makes it possible for those options and their framings the choice architectures to be tailored to the individual chooser. They are constructed based on information collected about our individual preferences, interests, aspirations, and vulnerabilities, with the goal of influencing our decisions. At the same time, because we are habituated to these technologies we pay them little notice. They are, as philosophers of technology put it, transparent to us effectively invisible. I argue that this invisible layer of technological mediation, which structures and influences our decision-making, renders us deeply susceptible to manipulation.

To analyze the impact of publicly naming and disclosing performance results of biased AI systems, we investigate the commercial impact of Gender Shades, the first algorithmic audit of gender and skin type performance disparities in commercial facial analysis models. This paper 1) outlines the audit design and structured disclosure procedure used in the Gender Shades study, 2) presents new performance metrics from targeted companies IBM, Microsoft and Megvii (Face++) on the Pilot Parliaments Benchmark (PPB) as of August 2018, 3) provides performance results on PPB by non-target companies Amazon and Kairos and, 4) explores differences in company responses as shared through corporate communications that contextualize differences in performance on PPB. Within 7 months of the original audit, we find that all three targets released new API versions. All targets reduced accuracy disparities between males and females and darker and lighter-skinned subgroups, with the most significant update occurring for the darker-skinned female subgroup, that underwent a 17.7% - 30.4% reduction in error between audit periods. Minimizing these disparities led to a 5.72% to 8.3% reduction in overall error on the Pilot Parliaments Benchmark (PPB) for target corporation APIs. The overall performance of nontargets Amazon and Kairos lags significantly behind that of the targets, with error rates of 8.66% and 6.60% overall, and error rates of 31.37% and 22.50% for the darker female subgroup, respectively.;"[Raji, Inioluwa Deborah] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Buolamwini, Joy] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA";Raji, ID (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.;"deborah.raji@mail.utoronto.ca; joyab@mit.edu";;;;;;38;7;7;2;2;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA;;;978-1-4503-6324-2;;;;2019;;;;;;;429;435;;10.1145/3306618.3314244;;;7;Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence;Computer Science;BP5KP;WOS:000556121100060;;;;;2020-12-16;

These algorithms find myriads of applications, but their ubiquity often comes at the expense of limited interpretability, hidden biases and unexpected vulnerabilities. Whenever one of these factors is a priority, the learning algorithm of choice is often a method considered to be inherently interpretable, e.g. logical models such as decision trees. In my research I challenge this assumption and highlight (quite common) cases when the assumed interpretability fails to deliver. To restore interpretability of logical machine learning models (decision trees and their ensembles in particular) I propose to explain them with class-contrastive counterfactual statements, which are a very common type of explanation in human interactions, well-grounded in social science research. To evaluate transparency of such models I collate explainability desiderata that can be used to systematically assess and compare such methods as an addition to user studies. Given contrastive explanations, I investigate their influence on the model's security, in particular gaming and stealing the model. Finally, I evaluate model fairness, where I am interested in choosing the most fair model among all the models with equal performance.;[Sokol, Kacper] Univ Bristol, Dept Comp Sci, Bristol, Avon, England;Sokol, K (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Dept Comp Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.;K.Sokol@bristol.ac.uk;;;;;;8;0;0;1;1;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA;;;978-1-4503-6324-2;;;;2019;;;;;;;541;542;;10.1145/3306618.3314316;;;2;Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence;Computer Science;BP5KP;WOS:000556121100082;;;;;2020-12-16;

However, many of these current robots operate in discrete settings with predefined expectations for specific social interactions. In order for these machines to operate in the real world, they must be capable of understanding the multiple factors that contribute to human-human interaction. One such factor is emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence allows one to consider the emotional state of another in order to motivate, plan, and achieve one's desires. One common method of analyzing the emotional state of an individual involves analyzing the emotion displayed on their face. Several artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been developed to conduct this task. These systems are often classifiers trained using a variety of machine learning techniques which require large amounts of training data. As such, they are susceptible to biases that may appear during performance analyses due to disproportions existing in training datasets. Children, in particular, are often less represented in the primary datasets of annotated faces used for training such emotion classification systems. This work seeks to first analyze the extent of these performance differences in commercial systems, then to present new computational techniques that work to mitigate some of the effects of minimal representation in datasets, and to finally present a social robot which utilizes an improved emotional AI to interact with children in various scenarios where emotional intelligence is key to successful human-robot interaction.;[Bryant, De'Aira] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA;Bryant, D (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.;dbryant@gatech.edu;;;;;;5;1;1;1;1;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA;;;978-1-4503-6324-2;;;;2019;;;;;;;547;548;;10.1145/3306618.3314319;;;2;Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence;Computer Science;BP5KP;WOS:000556121100085;;;;;2020-12-16;

Moreover, evaluations which fail to show generalization might hide algorithm weak-spots, which could eventually lead to reliability and security issues later on. To solve this problem we propose Toxin, a framework for automated, data-driven bench-marking of, e.g., network algorithms. In a first proof-of-concept implementation, we use Toxin to generate challenging traffic datasets for a data center networking use case.;"[Lettner, Sebastian; Blenk, Andreas] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany";Lettner, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany.;"sebastian.lettner@tum.de; andreas.blenk@tum.de";;;European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programEuropean Research Council (ERC) [647158 -FlexNets];This work is part of a project that has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No 647158 -FlexNets).;;18;0;0;0;0;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA;;;978-1-4503-7006-6;;;;2019;;;;;;;31;33;;10.1145/3360468.3366779;;;3;Computer Science, Theory & Methods;Computer Science;BP5LB;WOS:000556140800012;;Green Published;;;2020-12-16;

While schools around the world are becoming more digital and AI-powered, some educational institutions are going in the opposite direction by removing all electronic devices and software from the classroom and creating a zero-tech experience to improve academic results of their students. The study is based on the research works devoted of artificial intelligence and its increasing impact on the educational system as well as on materials and reports published by leading international organizations and institutions dealing with artificial intelligence. The article is also based on the real-life results of the pilot zero-tech project. Analyzing practices of AI-powered educational programs and their social impact, the author tries to define challenges and new perspectives for learning process of today and tomorrow. As a result of the analysis, the author concludes that humanity already came to the point where the further penetration of artificial intelligence into the sphere of education is inevitable.

In the context of tutoring, when AI augments academic faculty, mimicking faculty personality aspects may positively impact learners' achievement. The aim of this study was to identify and examine what faculty traits to implement in AI agents. A validated instrument, based on the Big Five Inventory (BFI), was used to support participants (n=72) recalling personality factors of familiar, exceptional educators they've encountered. Results from median dimension score analysis displayed a preference for four broad trait dimensions: Conscientiousness (88%), Agreeableness (86%), Extraversion (75%) and Openness (74%). A strong positive preference for Agreeableness and Conscientiousness and negative preference for Neuroticism related to the Digmans' superfactor Alpha which is related to social development. This study supports the need for an affect element in AI driven pedagogical agents. Furthermore, it clarifies the specific preferences of Singapore based medical students.

In this context, ToolboX Academy is a programming platform which subscribes a slightly new approach to attack the problem, in four differential aspects: 1) While most attention focuses on block-based approaches (Scratch and Code.org being the most popular initiatives), ToolboX embraces coding as it works for developers: text-based programming; 2) ToolboX embeds mainstream programming languages, which are widely used, are supported by big communities, are weakly typed, and closer to human natural language, like it is Javascript, for web applications, and GNU Octave, in engineering and scientific research; 3) it provides user-oriented problem-based learning, designed upon educational research results; and 4) it integrates curricular subjects in learning to code. In this paper, we review the design constraints taken into account to develop ToolboX Academy, and how it has been tested in the classroom. Some features are particularly stressed, like the use of open formats for content representation (definition of tasks or problems); the design of a simplified environment to represent most CS concepts, from basic loops to complex graph traversal strategies; and the use of learning analytics based on big data algorithms that can help educators and managers to learn from the interaction of their students with this environment.";"[Vico, F.] Univ Malaga, D Lenguajes & Ciencias Comp, Malaga, Spain; [Vico, F.; Masa, J.; Garcia, R.] ToolboX Acad, Madrid, Spain";"Vico, F (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, D Lenguajes & Ciencias Comp, Malaga, Spain.; Vico, F (corresponding author), ToolboX Acad, Madrid, Spain.";;;;;;;14;0;0;0;0;IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT;VALENICA;LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN;2340-1117;;978-84-09-12031-4;EDULEARN PROC;;;2019;;;;;;;5173;5178;;;;;6;Education & Educational Research;Education & Educational Research;BP4FG;WOS:000551093105043;;;;;2020-12-16;

The new robotic systems are currently adopting the autonomous approach already in use in military sector; however, in this context the intensity of operations and the necessity to interact with high productivity systems introduce different challenges. Despite the problems, it is evident that this approach could provide very interesting improvements in terms of safety for humans especially in relations to dangerous area. For instance, in confined spaces, Oil & Gas or Hot Metal Industry these new autonomous systems could reduce the number of injures and casualties. In addition, these systems could increase the operation efficiency in this complex frameworks as well as the possibility to carry out inspections systematically; in this sense, this could result in improving the overall reliability, productivity and safety of the whole Industrial Plant. Therefore, it is important to consider that these systems could be used to address also security aspects such as access control, however they could result vulnerable to new threats such as the cyber ones and need to be properly designed in terms of single entities, algorithms, infrastructure and architecture. From this point of view, it is evident that Modeling and Simulation represent the main approach to design properly these new systems. In this paper, the authors present the use of autonomous systems introducing advanced capabilities supported by Artificial Intelligence to deal with complex operations in dangerous industrial frameworks.

Therefore, data providers should improve the intrinsic quality of published data to prevent the diffusion of data sets practically impossible to use. Among all data providers, it is critical that governments and public agencies better assess and improve the quality of the produced data sets as early as possible - ideally during the production phase. Besides the quality aspect, data providers should also bear in mind that if they want to expose personal information, data must be compliant with EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Thus, this paper introduces a methodology to scaffold the agile production of Open Data (OD) that takes into account both quality and privacy concerns. To guarantee efficiency, our methodology is based on a pattern matching approach enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI) - in particular by using decision trees. The presented approach has been tested on real data sets already published as OD. In the evaluation, the advantages offered by the support of AI are evident.

In this paper, we expand on the concepts of Digital Era Governance and its successor, Essentially Digital Government, by introducing the concept of Algorithmic Bureaucracy, which looks at the impacts of artificial intelligence on the socio-technical nature of public administration. We report on a mixed-method study, which focused on how the growth of data science is changing the ways that local government works in the United Kingdom. Under Algorithmic Bureaucracy, the direct and indirect effects of public administrative changes on the level of social problem solving may become positive in two cases: 1) where through artificial intelligence and isocratic administration the explainability of algorithmic processes increases individual and staff competence, and 2) where algorithms take on some of the role of processing institutional and policy complexity much more effectively than humans.;"[Vogl, Thomas M.; Ganesh, Bharath; Bright, Jonathan] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England; [Seidelin, Cathrine] IT Univ Copenhagen, Comp Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark";Vogl, TM (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England.;"thomas.vogl@oii.ox.ac.uk; cfre@itu.dk; bharath.ganesh@oii.ox.ac.uk; jonathan.bright@oii.ox.ac.uk";;;Google;This study was supported by funding from Google.

This revamped version of policy analysis continues the long-standing tradition of applying statistical modeling to better understand policy effects and decision making, but also incorporates other computational approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) and computer simulation. Although much attention has been given to the development of capabilities for data analysis, there is much less attention to understanding the role of data management in a context of AI in government. In this paper, we argue that data management capabilities are foundational to data analysis of any kind, but even more important in the present AI context. This is so because without proper data management, simply acquiring data or systems will not produce desired outcomes. We also argue that realizing the potential of AI for social good relies on investments specifically focused on this social outcome, investments in the processes of building trust in government data, and ensuring the data are ready and suitable for use, for both immediate and future uses.;"[Harrison, Teresa M.; Luna-Reyes, Luis F.; DePaula, Nic; Najafabadi, Mahdi M.] SUNY Albany, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Pardo, Theresa A.; Palmer, Jillian M.] CTG UAlbany, Albany, NY USA";Harrison, TM (corresponding author), SUNY Albany, Albany, NY 12222 USA.;"tharrison@albany.edu; lluna-reyes@albany.edu; tpardo@ctg.albany.edu; ndepaula@albany.edu; mnajafabadi@albany.edu; jmpalmer@ctg.albany.edu";;;;;;34;1;1;1;1;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA;;;978-1-4503-7204-6;;;;2019;;;;;;;171;176;;10.1145/3325112.3325245;;;6;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Public Administration";"Computer Science; Public Administration";BP5KB;WOS:000555903400021;;;;;2020-12-16;

Here, we identify CBED images by artificial intelligence methods to solve that problem. The method includes segmenting patterns and analyzing mirror symmetry of CBED images. Canny edge detection and Hough transform are used to divide CBED patterns into discs individually, which can successfully extract common key information of all CBED images. Then the direct grey level symmetry similarity evaluation (DGLS) and texture symmetric similarity detection method based on principal component analysis (TSPCA) are both calculated to estimate mirror symmetry performance quantitatively. The average matching rate of accuracy between computer calculation and visual inspection is 96.0% for DGLS and 97% for TSPCA. This method provides a uniform standard for mirror symmetry identification and is more conducive and objective to the analysis of a large number of experimental CBED images, which is of great significance to promote the further research of reading local structure for ferroelectric ceramic.;"[He, Z.

Those losses are due to the difference between the amount paid by insurance companies and the exact amount that should be spent, which cost millions of dollars yearly. Experts assert that these losses are caused by inefficient claims processing, frauds, and poor decision-making in the company. With the huge advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine and deep learning algorithms, those technologies have started being used in insurance industry to solve such problems and cope with their negative consequences. In this paper, we propose automated and efficient deep learning-based architectures for vehicle damage detection and localization. The proposed solution combines deep learning, instance segmentation, and transfer learning techniques for features extraction and damage identification. Its objective is to automatically detect damages in vehicles, locate them, classify their severity levels, and visualize them by contouring their exact locations. Numerical results reveal that our transfer learning proposed solution, based on Inception-ResnetV2 pre-trained model followed by a fully connected neural network, achieves higher performances in features extraction and damage detection/localization than another pre-trained model, i.e., VGG16.;"[Dhieb, Najmeddine; Ghazzai, Hakim; Massoud, Yehia] Stevens Inst Technol, Sch Syst & Enterprises, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Dhieb, Najmeddine; Besbes, Hichem] Univ Carthage, Higher Sch Commun Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia";"Dhieb, N (corresponding author), Stevens Inst Technol, Sch Syst & Enterprises, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.; Dhieb, N (corresponding author), Univ Carthage, Higher Sch Commun Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.";"ndhieb@stevens.edu; hghazzai@stevens.edu; hichem.besbes@supcom.tn; ymassoud@stevens.edu";;Ghazzai, Hakim/0000-0002-8636-4264;;;;15;1;1;1;1;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2159-1679;;978-1-7281-4058-2;INT C MICROELECTRON;;;2019;;;;;;;158;161;;;;;4;"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology";"Engineering; Science & Technology - Other Topics";BP5HK;WOS:000555677600038;;;;;2020-12-16;

Under this perspective, enemy forces will seek to disable or disturb our autonomous Things and our complex infrastructures and systems. Autonomy, scale and complexity in our defense systems will trigger new cyber-attack strategies, and autonomous intelligent malware (AIM) will be part of the picture. Should these cyber-attacks succeed while human operators remain unaware or unable to react fast enough due to the speed, scale or complexity of the mission, systems or attacks, missions would fail, our networks and C4ISR would be heavily disrupted, and command and control would be disabled. New cyber-defense doctrines and technologies are therefore required. Autonomous cyber defense (ACyD) is a new field of research and technology driven by the defense sector in anticipation of such threats to future military infrastructures, systems and operations. It will be implemented via swarms of autonomous intelligent cyber-defense agents (AICAs) that will fight AIM within our networks and systems. This paper presents this cyber-defense technology of the future, the current state of the art in this field and its main challenges. First, we review the rationale of the ACyD concept and its associated AICA technology. Then, we present the current research results from NATO's IST-152 Research Task Group on the AICA Reference Architecture.

Deep learning methods such as CNN, Residual Neural Network (ResNet), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are the fundamental neural network models we used to develop a multi-class classifier.

In this following study, we apply Data Augmentation (DA) to the data set in order to further increase the performance of our models. The goal of data augmentation is to push the decision boundary learned from the data set toward a better decision boundary by adding more meaningful data points. An effective data augmentation method for RF signals is to add white Gaussian noise to the existing RF signals. Individual DL models and ensemble learning methods such as blending trained over the augmented data set significantly improve the prediction accuracies for weak RF signals and achieve comparable results to the two leading teams in the competition.;"[Wang, Peng; Vindiola, Manuel] US Army, Res Lab, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005 USA";Wang, P (corresponding author), US Army, Res Lab, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005 USA.;;;;;;;11;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2155-7578;;978-1-7281-4280-7;IEEE MILIT COMMUN C;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;6;"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Telecommunications";BP4XA;WOS:000554849700085;;;;;2020-12-16;

We develop three models, inspired by Social Psychology literature, to quantify the known adversary in paired user studies, and test them using a case study. Our results indicate that our proposed adapted-relationship closeness inventory and known adversary inventory models could accurately quantify and predict the known adversary.

At present, the most important thing that network administrators care about is minimizing the damage to the enterprises when cyber security crimes invade the information system or attack the system anytime. Therefore, how they can proactively protect information, ensure the privacy of users, how to improve the confidentiality and security of information in business system. To solve the problem above, the research Early warning solution about system security based on log analysis is extremely necessary, because it can help to warn and detect early-attacking information when there are abnormal signs in systems via logs. By inheriting the advantages, as well as overcoming the limitations of those previous related topics in the world, in this paper, we would like to develop and to build an early warning application tool capable of interacting, monitoring, adjusting, notifying from the scouting process of the attackers. The new proposed system in this research is based on the characteristics of attack techniques, components and packets through the system, we design a data collection model of Logs input and output. In order to detect and explore abnormal activities in network which are harmful for information systems, we use the log analysis of the information system with the method of analyzing APT target. We study the APT and its characteristic to build the knowledge that we can use an advanced AI algorithm, Deep & Wide Learning algorithm.

The system-in package (SiP) becomes a promising solution to satisfy those requirements. Not only the SiP has a smaller form factor, but also it provides improved signal integrity because the shorter channel length can be achieved. The decreased distance between the logic chips and the memories lower the insertion loss, the crosstalk level, and therefore the signal degradation can be minimized. However, a high level of the system integration in the SiP and the high computing performance can result in a poor thermal management. The high computing performance requires increasing the transistor densities in various IPs, and the switching speeds of the transistors. This leads to increased power consumptions, which cause large thermal dissipations. The thermal dissipations in the package aggravate transistor performance, which yields an overall performance degradation or system malfunctions. Using heat spreader or high thermal conductive material can mitigate the thermal issues, but they are insufficient solutions. In order to improve the thermal management in the SiP, a novel SiP structure is introduced. The proposed SiP has thermal dissipation paths, which is called thermal chimney, from logic/memory dies to the heat spreader. The thermal chimney is high thermal conductive material, and it establishes a direct channel for heat flowing from the chip to the heat spreader to reduce the temperature in the package. In this study, the thermally efficient SiP geometry, how it cools down the package temperature and the manufacturing process will be described. The electrical and thermal performance will be analyzed when assuming the SiP consists of modems and DRAM memories.;"[Kim, Sang Kyu; Oh, Dan (Kyung Suk); Hwang, Seungtae; Lee, Bang Weon; Cha, Seung Yong; Kim, Tae Hun] Samsung Elect Co Ltd, Package Dev Test & Syst, Package, Hwasung Si, South Korea";Kim, SK (corresponding author), Samsung Elect Co Ltd, Package Dev Test & Syst, Package, Hwasung Si, South Korea.;sangkyu9.kim@samsung.com;;;;;;5;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2151-1225;;978-1-7281-2432-2;ELEC DES ADV PACKAG;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;3;"Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";Engineering;BP5GN;WOS:000555483500036;;;;;2020-12-16;

Recently, computerization and robotics have added to this fear like never before. Smart and innovative ways of using computers, robots and internets have threatened to displace even those humans who are engaged in the high-middle level management cadre. Teachers are feeling threatened as online courses have started flooding the internet. With promising research in the area of artificial intelligence and robotics being reported frequently, even high level cadres along with the middle-level management cadres are feeling unsecured about their jobs. Automation is widely understood to be targeting at displacing humans from their jobs. Are we moving towards a jobless world where there will be no jobs left for humans? This paper aims at finding an answer to such concerns first by finding a similarity between a thermodynamic system and a social/commercial establishment and then applying the laws of thermodynamics to such systems. It will be interesting to compare a social/business establishment with those of a thermodynamic system and identify isomorphism associated with both the systems.

In particular, driving data consists of multiple normal situations (e.g., right turn, going straight), some of which (e.g., U-turn) could be as rare as anomalous ones. Existing machine learning based anomaly detection approaches do not fare sufficiently well when applied to such imbalanced data. In this paper, we present a novel multi-task learning (LSTM autoencoder and predictor) based approach that leverages domain-knowledge (maneuver labels) for anomaly detection in driving data.

This paper presents our recent research on developing SAR by evaluating the ability of a life-like conversational social robot, called Ryan, to administer internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) to older adults with depression. For Ryan to administer the therapy, we developed a dialogue-management system, called Program-R. Using an accredited CBT manual for the treatment of depression, we created seven hour-long iCBT dialogues and integrated them into Program-R using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML). To assess the effectiveness of Robot-based iCBT and users' likability of our approach, we conducted an HRI study with a cohort of elderly people with mild-to-moderate depression over a period of four weeks.

However, as robots and humans come closer together in their interactions, the matter of interpretability, or explainability of robot decision-making processes for the human grows in importance. A successful interaction and collaboration would only be possible through mutual understanding of underlying representations of the environment and the task at hand. This is currently a challenge in deep learning systems. We present a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning system, consisting of a low-level agent handling the large actions/states space of a robotic system efficiently, by following the directives of a high-level agent which is learning the high-level dynamics of the environment and task. This high-level agent forms a representation of the world and task at hand that is interpretable for a human operator. The method, which we call Dot-to-Dot, is tested on a MuJoCo-based model of the Fetch Robotics Manipulator, as well as a Shadow Hand, to test its performance.

Commercial surgical robots do not perform any sub-tasks - even of repetitive or non-invasive nature - autonomously or provide intelligent assistance. While this is primarily due to safety and regulatory reasons, the state of such automation intelligence also lacks the reliability and robustness for use in high-risk applications. Recent developments in continuous control using Artificial Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning have prompted growing research interest in automating mundane sub-tasks. To build on this, we present an inspired Asynchronous Framework which incorporates realtime dynamic simulation - manipulable with the masters of a surgical robot and various other input devices - and interfaces with learning agents to train and potentially allow for the execution of shared sub-tasks. The scope of this framework is generic to cater to various surgical (as well as non-surgical) training and control applications. This scope is demonstrated by examples of multi-user and multi-manual applications which allow for realistic interactions by incorporating distributed control, shared task allocation and a well-defined communication pipe-line for learning agents. These examples are discussed in conjunction with the design philosophy, specifications, system-architecture and metrics of the Asynchronous Framework and the accompanying Simulator.

In fact, it is also a critical component for their operation on sky. The goals of these instruments range from the detection of the light from the most distant galaxies to the analysis of the composition of exoplanets terrestrial atmospheres. Based on advanced AO techniques, the instrument MOSAIC relies on a computational framework to filter out the Earth atmospheric turbulence and eventually enhance the images quality out of ground-based telescopes. The ToR calculation is a compute-bound operation based on the Cholesky factorization. Due to its cubical algorithmic complexity, the ToR may represent a major bottleneck for the E-ELT when scaling up the large number of wavefront sensors used in the baseline MOSAIC design. To mitigate this increasing dimensionality overhead, this paper presents the implementation of a novel mixed-precision Cholesky-based dense matrix solver on hardware accelerators. The new algorithm takes into account the data-sparse structure of the covariance matrix operator and uses the tensor cores of NVIDIA V100 GPUs to leverage performance at an unprecedented scale. To our knowledge, this is the first computational astronomy application that exploits V100's tensor cores outside of the traditional arena of artificial intelligence. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy robustness and the high performance of the mixed-precision ToR on synthetic datasets, which paves the way for future instrument deployments on the E-ELT.;"[Doucet, Nicolas; Ltaief, Hatem; Keyes, David] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Extreme Comp Res Ctr, Jeddah 23955, Saudi Arabia; [Doucet, Nicolas; Gratadour, Damien] Paris Observ, LESIA, Paris, France";"Doucet, N (corresponding author), King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Extreme Comp Res Ctr, Jeddah 23955, Saudi Arabia.; Doucet, N (corresponding author), Paris Observ, LESIA, Paris, France.";"Nicolas.Doucet@obspm.fr; Hatem.Ltaief@kaust.edu.sa; Damien.Gratadour@obspm.fr; David.Keyes@kaust.edu.sa";;"Ltaief, Hatem/0000-0002-6897-1095; Keyes, David Elliot/0000-0002-4052-7224";;;;33;0;0;0;0;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA;;;978-1-7281-5987-4;;;;2019;;;;;;;31;38;;10.1109/IA349570.2019.00011;;;8;"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP4MO;WOS:000553241300005;;;;;2020-12-16;

Against this background, the verification of such claimed location information will be an issue of growing importance. A formal information-theoretic Location Verification System (LVS) can address this issue to some extent, but such a system usually operates within the limits of idealistic assumptions on a-priori information on the proportions of genuine and malicious users in the field. In this work, we address this critical limitation by using a Neural Network (NN) showing how such a NN based LVS is capable of efficiently functioning even when the proportions of genuine and malicious users are completely unknown a-priori. We demonstrate the improved performance of this new form of LVS based on Time of Arrival measurements from multiple verifying base stations within the context of vehicular networks, quantifying how our NN-LVS outperforms the stand-alone information-theoretic LVS in a range of anticipated real-world conditions. We also show the efficient performance for the NN-LVS when the users' signals have added Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) bias in them.

However, these technologies can be used to lend their highly accurate localisation capabilities to low-cost, commodity, and less-accurate technologies. In this paper, we bridge this link by proposing a technology-agnostic calibration framework based on artificial intelligence to assist such low-cost technologies through highly accurate localisation systems. A single-layer neural network is used to calibrate a less accurate technology using a more accurate one such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) using Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and UWB using a professional motion tracking system. On a real indoor testbed, we demonstrate an improvement in accuracy of approximately 70% for BLE and 50% for UWB.

To this end, we formulate a problem of an optimal offloading design in the presence of dynamic compute-intensive applications in wireless networks.

Unfortunately, these deep learning models have become susceptible to adversarial attacks that can severely impact its integrity. Research has shown that many state-of-the-art models are vulnerable to attacks by well-crafted adversarial examples. These adversarial examples are perturbed versions of clean data with a small amount of noise added to it. These adversarial samples are imperceptible to the human eye yet they can easily fool the targeted model. The exposed vulnerabilities of these models raise the question of their usability in safety-critical real-world applications such as autonomous driving and medical applications. In this work, we have documented the effectiveness of six different gradient-based adversarial attacks on ResNet image recognition model. Defending against these adversaries is challenging. Adversarial re-training has been one of the widely used defense technique. It aims at training a more robust model capable of handling the adversarial examples attack by itself. We showcase the limitations of traditional adversarial-retraining techniques that could be effective against some adversaries but does not protect against more sophisticated attacks.

The use of an AI-powered reflector allows changing the propagation direction of mmW signals and, thus, improving coverage particularly for non-line-of-sight (LoS) areas. However, due to the possibility of stochastic blockage over mmW links, designing an intelligent phase shift-control policy for the mmW reflector to guarantee ultra-reliable mmW communications becomes very challenging. In this regard, first, based on the framework of risk-sensitive reinforcement learning, a parametric risksensitive episodic return is proposed to maximize the expected bit rate while mitigating the risk of non-LoS mmW link in the presence of future stochastic blockage over the mmW links. Then, a closed-form approximation for the gradient of the risk-sensitive episodic return is analytically derived. To directly find the optimal policy for the proposed phase-shift controller, a parametric functional-form policy is implemented using a deep recurrent neural network (RNN). Then, based on the derived closed-form gradient of risk-sensitive episodic return, the deep RNN-based parametric functional-form policy is trained. The efficiency of the proposed AI-powered reflector is evaluated in an office environment. Simulation results show that the root-mean-square errors between the optimal and approximate phase shift-control policies of the proposed deep RNN is 1.35% in the worst case. Moreover, on average, the mean value and variance of the achievable rates resulting from the deep RNN-based policy are only 1% and 2% less than the optimal solution for different unknown mobile users' trajectories, respectively.;"[Soorki, Mehdi Naderi; Saad, Walid] Virginia Tech, Bradley Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Wireless VT, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Soorki, Mehdi Naderi; Bennis, Mehdi] Univ Oulu, Ctr Wireless Commun, Oulu, Finland";"Soorki, MN (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Bradley Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Wireless VT, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.; Soorki, MN (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Ctr Wireless Commun, Oulu, Finland.";"mehdin@vt.edu; walids@vt.edu; mehdi.bennis@oulu.fi";Bennis, Mehdi/ABE-5838-2020;Bennis, Mehdi/0000-0003-0261-0171;U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CNS-1836802, CNS-1814477];This research was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grants CNS-1836802 and CNS-1814477.;;15;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2334-0983;;978-1-7281-0962-6;IEEE GLOB COMM CONF;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;6;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";BP4GG;WOS:000552238602006;;;;;2020-12-16;

Leveraging on artificial intelligence will enable IoT devices to operate autonomously by using inherently distributed learning techniques. Fully distributed resource management will free devices from draining their limited energy by constantly communicating with a centralized controller. The present work is devoted to a specific IoT context, that of LoRaWAN, where devices communicate with the access network via ALOHA-type access and spread spectrum technology. Con-current transmissions on different spreading factors increase the network capacity. However, the bottleneck is inevitable with the expected massive deployment of LoRa devices. To address this issue, we resort to the popular EXP3 (Exponential Weights for Exploration and Exploitation) algorithm to steer autonomously the decision of LoRa devices towards the least solicited spreading factors. Furthermore, the spreading factor selection is cast as a proportional fair optimization problem used as a benchmark for the learning-based algorithm. Extensive simulations were run in a realistic environment taking into account physical phenomena in LoRaWAN such as the capture effect and inter-spreading factor collision, as well as non-uniform device distribution. In such a realistic setting, we evaluate the performances of the EXP3.S algorithm, an efficient variant of the EXP3 algorithm, and show its relevance against the fair centralized solution and basic heuristics.;"[Ta, Duc-Tuyen; Martin, Steven] Univ Paris Saclay, LRI, ROCS, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Khawam, Kinda] Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, F-78000 Versailles, France; [Lahoud, Samer] Univ St Joseph Beyrouth, Fac Ingn ESIB, Beirut, Lebanon; [Ta, Duc-Tuyen; Adjih, Cedric] CRI Saclay Ile De France, INRIA, F-91120 Palaiseau, France";"Ta, DT (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, LRI, ROCS, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, France.; Ta, DT (corresponding author), CRI Saclay Ile De France, INRIA, F-91120 Palaiseau, France.";;;;Labex DigiCosme [ANR11-LABEX-0045-DIGICOSME, ANR-11-IDEX-0003-02];This research was partially supported by Labex DigiCosme (project ANR11-LABEX-0045-DIGICOSME) operated by ANR as part of the program Investissement d'Avenir Idex Paris-Saclay (ANR-11-IDEX-0003-02).;;12;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2334-0983;;978-1-7281-0962-6;IEEE GLOB COMM CONF;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;6;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";BP4GG;WOS:000552238601086;;;;;2020-12-16;

Existing researches of fog e-health has the potential of providing real-time medical services for the countryside with body sensor networks (BSN), but there are two limitations. On one hand, because of the medical services requiring not only low-latency but also high-quality, constructing an AI e-health service on resource-constrained fog with edge AI is necessary but unsolved. On the other hand, because of the regional differences in disease risk, there is a lack of an effective mechanism to provide a customized fog AI e-health service for patients in different regions. To address these issues, a smart customized e-health (SCEH) framework is proposed in this paper to provide edge-intelligent and customized medical services for the countryside. Firstly, semantics-based lightweight and meticulous load management mechanism is designed to reduce data load and involve medical semantic. Secondly, model-ensemble based fog AI collaborative analysis mechanism is proposed for load balance and knowledge integration. Thirdly, an attention-weight based customized fog AI e-health generation mechanism is devised for regional medical model reconstruction. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of SCEH which ensures both the accuracy and low latency of fog e-health with limited resource.;"[Xu, Chuanhua; Li, Jianhua; Wu, Jun] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chuanhua; Li, Jianhua; Wu, Jun] Shanghai Key Lab Integrated Adm Technol Informat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Dong, Mianxiong; Ota, Kaoru] Muroran Inst Technol, Dept Informat & Elect Engn, Muroran, Hokkaido 0508585, Japan; [Yang, Wu] Harbin Engn Univ, Informat Secur Res Ctr, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China";"Xu, CH (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.; Xu, CH (corresponding author), Shanghai Key Lab Integrated Adm Technol Informat, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.";"sunmory@sjtu.edu.cn; mx.dong@csse.muroran-it.ac.jp; ota@csse.muroran-it.ac.jp; lijh888@sjtu.edu.cn; yangwu@hrbeu.edu.cn; junwuhn@sjtu.edu.cn";;;"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61431008, 61831007]; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16K00117, JP19K20250]; KDDI FoundationKDDI Corporation";This work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61431008, 61831007 and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP16K00117, JP19K20250 and KDDI Foundation.;;18;0;0;2;2;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2334-0983;;978-1-7281-0962-6;IEEE GLOB COMM CONF;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;6;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";BP4GG;WOS:000552238604165;;;;;2020-12-16;

The existing works just focus on cloud-edge or edge-device cooperative AI which suffers low learning efficiency of AI, while edge-to-edge cooperative AI is still an unresolved issue. Moreover, the existing researches concentrate on the computation offloading of the AI-based task, ignoring that it is a brain-like task performing sophisticated processing to raw data, which leads to the high latency and low quality of the learning services. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an on-demand learning offloading mechanism for edge-to-edge cooperative AI. Firstly, the principle of the learning capability and its offloading are proposed for the formal description of the learning resources migration. Secondly, the proposed mechanism realizes the bilateral learning offloading utilizing edge-to-edge and cloud-edge collaborations to handle AI-based tasks with high learning efficiency and resource utilization rate. Moreover, we model the edge-to-edge learning offloading allocation based on the concatenation of deep neural network (DNN) subtasks and their heterogeneous requirement of learning resources.

A specific capacitance density (C-s) of up to 340 nF/mm(2) is achieved over a large capacitor array, providing a total capacitance (C-t) of up to 68 mu F per interposer die. The HK dielectric has intrinsic time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) lifetime of > 1,000 years at an operation voltage (V-cc) of 1.35V, and a normalized leakage current (I-LK) density < 1 fA/mu m(2) under 1.35V at 105 degrees C. No discernable process induced damage or performance degradation (capacitance, I-LK & V-bd tailing) were observed. The high capacitance, low leakage, large area and reliability-proven Si-interposer integrated DTC, or iCap, provides superior PI performance and therefore greatly enhances the merit of using CoWoS for the next-generation heterogeneous wafer level system integration (WLSI).;"[Hou, S.

In particular, the use of artificial intelligence can cause unpredictable behavior when encountering situations that were not included in the training data. We describe an alternative to static analysis and conventional testing that monitors and enforces formally specified properties describing a system's physical state. All external inputs and outputs are monitored by multiple parallel automata synthesized from guards specified as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas capturing application-specific correctness, safety, and liveness properties. Unlike conventional runtime verification, adding guards does not impact application software performance since the monitor automata are implemented in configurable hardware. In order to remove all dependencies on software, input/output controllers and drivers may also be implemented in configurable hardware. A reporting or corrective action may be taken when a guard is triggered. This architecture is consistent with the guidance prescribed in ASTM F3269-17, Methods to Safely Bound Behavior of Unmanned Aircraft Systems Containing Complex Functions. The monitor and input/output subsystem's minimal and isolated implementations are amenable to model checking since all components are independent finite state machines. Because this approach makes no assumptions about the root cause of deviation from specifications, it can detect and mitigate: malware threats; sensor and network attacks; software bugs; sensor, actuator and communication faults; and inadvertent or malicious operator errors.

In order to prepare students for resolving complex domain problems by using their digital skills, teachers apply different approaches and initiatives for digital transformation of teaching processes. In case of treating digital technologies as a means of learning and teaching, the usage level of these technologies depends on the teacher's competences and their readiness to apply technology in the teaching process. Therefore, it is important to understand which elements can affect the readiness of teachers to use technology in performing teaching processes. In that context, we analyse the application of digital technologies in teaching based on academic publications since the time of intense development of digital technologies.

For this reason, both in the world of education and in the business world, knowing English carries the person further. This contributes to the fact that those who know English are the most preferred choice in the business world and their personal accomplishments. In spite of this, it is evaluated that there are various difficulties in learning English and the contribution of technology to the learning of English is not discussed enough.

STEM education is an area undergoing a process of advanced transformation, both at the level of objectives and methodologies, with a strong social, economic and knowledge impact. Research-based education is a well-established term especially in the higher education system. More and more studies and key policy documents argue that education has to be based on the cutting edge research, while many universities are claiming to place the approach at the core value they believe in. However, different theoretical and methodological perspectives on the subject of research-based education combined with challenges related to the use of different resources and the necessary knowledge on behalf of teachers could make it very difficult to properly use it in the pre-university classroom. Much more natural is to test and asses the research-based teaching and learning outcome in an out-of-the-class setup, such as summer programs for students or extra-curricular activities. In the present study we will describe how a science and technology summer school program could be planned and used as a testbed (pilot) for developing a research-based methodology to teach STEM subjects to highschool students. There are some elements that makes Science and Technology Magurele Summer School unique in the national landscape, mainly because containing the most important ingredients: linking education to a real research environment, being conducted by researchers and builds on existing research on the field. A group of 40 highschool students selected based on previous results and interest in the topics has been exposed to science for one week, organized in small groups and working together with mentors (researchers) inside high level research laboratories of research institutes and universities research centers. They had the chance to learn how research is conducted and produces new knowledge, conduct own research as a part of their studies or participate in research projects of the academic staff. 16 themes have been proposed to students to choose from, with topics ranging from engineering to artificial intelligence, from robotics to biotechnology. All the proposed projects tackled a real challenge with a proven impact on daily life, for example how to attack a tumor cell using a high beam laser, how to improve earthquake buildings resistance using antiseismic elements, how to build and launch an environmental monitoring capsule in the stratosphere and measure important parameters as temperature, altitude, position, radiation, pollution, etc. To evaluate the initiative a set of input, process and output indicators that can provide insights to the effects of the link between education and research have been used and assessed.

The reason for these difficulties has to do with the variety of environments in the market, as well as the complexity to perform controlled multicenter experimentation with children that are exposed differently to computer programming (from no contact at all, to gaining skills at home, or in academies).

The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in ME is growing, with a specific focus on curriculum, learning support and assessment of learning. Further development of AI in ME needs more and richer data sets. We hypothesized that clinical data from the healthcare sector might enrich educational data by providing untapped big data sets with contextual relevance concerning the patient population and health system. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the value of using real clinical data in AI-driven medical education applications and explore use cases enabled by access to data from the healthcare sector. Over five million de-identified patient records from New York State hospitals were used in this study. Characterization of the clinical data identified new data at the population and patient levels. The identified use cases were an enriched medical education data warehouse, bridging the gap between academic and clinical practices, addressing new learning outcomes in a medical curriculum, more opportunities for AI research in medical education and the exploration of AI in continuing ME.;"[Wijayarathna, G.

Anyway, educational robotics projects are already part of the curriculum in many private schools, and begin to be present in public schools as well. If doubts remain about the relationship between content and technology, it is possible that technological education will be approached in a fragmented way and oriented to a pragmatism that would assume as valid only the applicable scientific knowledge. If this occurs, it is also possible for graduates of higher education courses to remain limited to the use and to the implementation of technologies rather than being oriented to protagonism attitudes face the need for innovation. Thus, this research turned to a verification about the stage of knowledge of teachers in Elementary Education level regarding to the relationship between scientific knowledge and technological knowledge. It is important the understanding that there is a relationship between science and technology, and consequently between school science content and current technologies, which goes against statements that content studied at the school are unrelated to the technological world in which children and adolescents are immersed. The research also investigated what is present in the various types of educational robotics dissemination material, including open access documents, technical manuals, scientific articles, academic dissertations and theses, official Brazilian educational documents, as well as the documentation of the Brazilian Olympiad of Robotics, because these materials will be taken as basis by teachers interested in using educational robotics in their pedagogical approaches. In addition, training activities were conducted with teachers of Elementary Education regarding the pedagogical perspectives of educational robotics, with answers to a thirty statements questionnaire about the subject. It is possible to conclude that teachers not only recognize the relationship between their areas of knowledge and the creation of technologies but also recognize that the contents addressed by them contribute to the formation of individuals with the capacity to create new technological products. However, activities related to this research also showed that they know superficially or are not aware of such advances and consequently the ways of transposing the resulting complexities to curricular contents. Those teachers, who demonstrate maturity in relation to democratic perspectives of technological constructions, also present substantivist understandings about technology recognizing it as neutral and as an application of science. The materials that constituted the documental corpus of the research were methodologically studied under the light of Discursive Textual Analysis, from which emerged categories indicating that current activities with educational robotics do not harmonize the complexities involved, while at the same time show pragmatists preferences. In order to reach these conclusions, current technologies and scientific advances were taken into account as well as studies in the field of Philosophy of Technology, having also epistemological support in the rationality and conception of science of Gaston Bachelard.;"[Schaeffer, Andre Gustavo] Fed Univ Fronteira Sul, Chapeco, SC, Brazil; [Peres Angotti, Jose Andre] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil";Schaeffer, AG (corresponding author), Fed Univ Fronteira Sul, Chapeco, SC, Brazil.;;;;Higher Education Personnel Improvement Coordination - Brazil (CAPES) [001];The research that originated this article was conducted with support from the Higher Education Personnel Improvement Coordination - Brazil (CAPES) - Financing Code 001.

What is the current state in terms of accessibility compliance of chatbots that work on social networks? This article seeks to answer this and other questions related to accessibility in Chatbots, conversational agents and virtual assistant's.

With this type of learning, it is essential for students to constantly reflect on their learning in order to adjust tasks and progress to the subsequent learning. However, when students reflect on learning, they often stick to the facts and their impressions of various activities. Thus, it is necessary for teachers to grasp the individual situation of each student, ideally through reading sentences of reflection on learning written by the student, and to facilitate reflection on learning appropriately. One promising direction is technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning that could be used to facilitate learning by analyzing large amounts of accumulated data. The purpose of this study is to develop a system that facilitates student reflection on learning by using a custom machine learning model. This model automatically classifies written sentences of reflection on learning with a focus on the different phases of reflection. We then facilitate further reflection on learning by grasping the situation from the classification result.

While the instrumentation available to the scientific community enables individual researchers to acquire experimental data at spectacular rates, often aided by robotic sample handling to reduce the user-imposed downtime of instruments, the decision making and experimental design process of the measurements is still largely driven by the individual researcher operating the instrument. In a typical scenario, a researcher combines existing insights from previous experiments with intermediate measurements to adapt their data acquisition plan to get the best possible data in the smallest amount of time or at the lowest possible cost. In recent years, some scientific areas, like X-Ray scattering and synchrotron infra-red microscopy, have started to shift towards autonomously executed experimentation, using tools from Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to move towards user-free experiments to maximize instrument efficiency, reduce bias and lower the overall risk of human-induced errors that can potentially damage the sample and instrumental setup. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a popular technique that enables the construction of a surrogate model required to drive an experiment in an autonomous fashion. GPRs have been successfully implemented at synchrotron radiation beam lines at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) and the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II). In the case of X-ray scattering applications, GPRs are used to predict the uncertainty in the experimental outcome, and by using optimization techniques, to adapt the data collection plan to decrease the total expected variance. Given that a single measurement on state-of-the-art synchrotron equipment can be acquired in a fraction of a second, being able to obtain feedback at a similar time scale is essential. Traditionally, specific tasks in GPR, such as hyper-parameter tuning and covariance estimation, are compute-intensive, limiting the utility of GPR as an appropriate tool when near real-time feedback, given a large amount of data, is an absolute necessity. In this paper we discuss, present and review computational strategies that allow the numerical acceleration of Gaussian Process analyses within a framework of autonomous sequential experiments. The results show that significant time savings can be achieved by taking advantage of a number of some rather well-established mathematical and computational approaches.;"[Noack, Marcus M.; Zwart, Petrus H.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, CAMERA, Computat Res Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zwart, Petrus H.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, BSISB, Mol Biophys & Integrated Bioimaging Div, Berkeley, CA USA";Noack, MM (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, CAMERA, Computat Res Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;"MarcusNoack@lbl.gov; phzwart@lbl.gov";;;"Center for Advanced Mathematics for Energy Research Applications (CAMERA) - Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Basic Energy Sciences (BES) within the Department of Energy's Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Berkeley Synchrotron Infrared Structural BioImaging (BSISB) program - US Department of Energy, Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [KP1501021]; Berkeley Synchrotron Infrared Structural BioImaging (BSISB) program - US Department of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental ResearchUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [KP1501021]; National Institute Of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM109019]";The work was partially funded through the Center for Advanced Mathematics for Energy Research Applications (CAMERA), which is jointly funded by the Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) and Basic Energy Sciences (BES) within the Department of Energy's Office of Science, under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.

Building the next generation of ICT infrastructure will power the evolution of smart, sustainable cities and communities worldwide. Making modern ICTs more widely available will foster the local innovation needed to spur domestic economic growth, provide decent work and reduce inequalities. Singh is just one of millions of Indians who've seen their lives improve in fundamental ways since the government started a biometric identification system called Aadhaar in 2010. The early success - and tremendous scale - of India's efforts are especially important to note at a time when digital financial services are increasingly seen as a key driver in the fight to alleviate poverty, the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal No. 1 (SDG 1). Globally, 1 in 9 people go hungry every day, according to the World Food Program. That's nearly 800 million people. And yet, some 1.3 billion tonnes of food are wasted every year. To combat this problem - and to make progress on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal No. 2 Zero Hunger - information and communication technologies (ICTs) are now increasingly being deployed to better connect the hungry to excess food at a scale and speed never before possible.

Mostly, all breaking news is posted earlier in twitter than any mainstream media. Hence, this micro-blogging social network experiences a deluge of information flow during natural disasters. Situation based mining of information from the twitter data, can play a significant role in disaster response and recovery. The large volume and velocity of data flow on twitter during disaster makes it tedious for the disaster rescue volunteers to manually analyze and retrieve information from them. An automated system that could retrieve relevant information from this enormous twitter data during a disaster, could be useful for the disaster relief volunteers to accomplish their duty efficiently amidst the chaos. During disasters, the volunteer's team may service more efficiently, if they had a classification based on the victims who request for donation and those who request rescue. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence based real time disaster response system-Disastro, which assists the volunteers by identifying the relevant tweets from the real time twitter data and classifying them under the domains rescue and donation. Disastro is empirically validated across various machine learning algorithms for classification using the tweets posted during Chennai rains and Kerala floods. The versatility of Disastro across different disasters and its improved classification accuracy makes it flexible and robust to handle any location-based emergencies.;"[Kanth, Krishna A.; Abirami, S.; Chitra, P.; Sowmya, Gayathri G.] Thiagarajar Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India";Kanth, AK (corresponding author), Thiagarajar Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.;"krishna@student.tce.edu; abirami.2t@gmail.com; pccse@tce.edu";;;;;;15;0;0;1;1;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA;;;978-1-7281-4894-6;;;;2019;;;;;;;82;86;;10.1109/HiPCW.2019.00029;;;5;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP4NP;WOS:000553428000018;;;;;2020-12-16;

However, unsupervised networks have long lagged behind the performance of their supervised counterparts, especially in the domain of large-scale visual recognition. Recent developments in training deep convolutional embeddings to maximize non-parametric instance separation and clustering objectives have shown promise in closing this gap. Here, we describe a method that trains an embedding function to maximize a metric of local aggregation, causing similar data instances to move together in the embedding space, while allowing dissimilar instances to separate. This aggregation metric is dynamic, allowing soft clusters of different scales to emerge.

One avenue that has recently begun to be explored is the use of latent representations of generative models. However, it remains an open problem to learn a generative model of shape that is interpretable and easily manipulated, particularly in the absence of supervised labels. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to partitioning the latent space of a variational autoencoder for 3D point clouds in a natural way, using only geometric information. Our method makes use of tools from spectral differential geometry to separate intrinsic and extrinsic shape information, and then considers several hierarchical disentanglement penalties for dividing the latent space in this manner, including a novel one that penalizes the Jacobian of the latent representation of the decoded output with respect to the latent encoding. We show that the resulting representation exhibits intuitive and interpretable behavior, enabling tasks such as pose transfer and pose-aware shape retrieval that cannot easily be performed by models with an entangled representation.;"[Aumentado-Armstrong, Tristan; Tsogkas, Stavros; Jepson, Allan; Dickinson, Sven] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Vector Inst AI, Toronto, ON, Canada; Samsung AI Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada";Aumentado-Armstrong, T (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.;"taumen@cs.utoronto.ca; stavros.t@samsung.com; allan.jepson@samsung.com; s.dickinson@samsung.com";Aumentado-Armstrong, Tristan/AAX-5245-2020;Aumentado-Armstrong, Tristan/0000-0003-4876-7246;"NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [CGS-M-510941-2017]; Samsung Research";We are grateful for support from NSERC (CGS-M-510941-2017) and Samsung Research.;;59;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;1550-5499;;978-1-7281-4803-8;IEEE I CONF COMP VIS;;;2019;;;;;;;8180;8189;;10.1109/ICCV.2019.00827;;;10;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";"Computer Science; Engineering";BP3PR;WOS:000548549203030;;;;;2020-12-16;

Habitat enables training embodied agents (virtual robots) in highly efficient photorealistic 3D simulation. Specifically, Habitat consists of: (i) Habitat-Sim: a flexible, high-performance 3D simulator with configurable agents, sensors, and generic 3D dataset handling. Habitat-Sim is fast - when rendering a scene from Matterport3D, it achieves several thousand frames per second (fps) running single-threaded, and can reach over 10,000 fps multi-process on a single GPU. (ii) Habitat-API: a modular high-level library for end-to-end development of embodied AI algorithms - defining tasks (e.g. navigation, instruction following, question answering), configuring, training, and benchmarking embodied agents. These large-scale engineering contributions enable us to answer scientific questions requiring experiments that were till now impracticable or `merely' impractical. Specifically, in the context of point-goal navigation: (1) we revisit the comparison between learning and SLAM approaches from two recent works [19, 16] and find evidence for the opposite conclusion - that learning outperforms SLAM if scaled to an order of magnitude more experience than previous investigations, and (2) we conduct the first cross-dataset generalization experiments {train, test}.{Matterport3D, Gibson} for multiple sensors {blind, RGB, RGBD, D} and find that only agents with depth (D) sensors generalize across datasets.

Though the traditional systems like Proportional, Integral and Derivative Controller (PID), On-Off controllers etc are in use, they fail to provide the intelligence and causes mathematical complexities in implementation. They consume more time to reach the high level of stability, large energy consumption and create oscillations and peak overshoots. This paper, spotlights on scheming the air conditioning system using Self-learning ANN based intelligent controller. It derives its inputs from the user and predicts the speed of the fan and water flow to achieve comfort at minimum energy consumption and least settling time.

A key factor in obtaining intelligent industrial Internet of things (IIoT) services is to integrate machine learning (ML) into IIoT. With the increasing scale of deployed terminals, IIoT becomes heterogeneous, diverse, and dynamically changeable. Traditional optimization methods are difficult to deal with the emerging network problems. This paper first proposes a ML-based IIoT architecture for intelligent IIoT services and expounds two ML methods for IIoT analysis, namely, deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL). Secondly, advanced applications and development trends of ML in industrial field are summarized. Opportunities and challenges of ML for IIoT analysis are discussed finally.

Machine learning has been widely used for fraud detection, spam detection, and malicious file detection, since it has the ability to dig the value of big data. However, for malicious attackers, there is a strong motivation to evade such algorithms. Because attackers do not know the specific parameters of the machine model, they can only carry out a black box attack. This paper proposes a method based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network(WGAN) to generate malicious PDF files which are similar to benign ones and can evade the malicious file detection system. The experimental results show that the adversarial examples generated by our method can evade the PDF classifier-PDFrate of 100%.

The trajectory that a robot performs during its operation is directly related to its wear, consumption, time and even space of security that should be delimited inside of the workspace. The artificial intelligence popularization parallels the expansion of its applications and technologies, such as genetic algorithms, fuzzy systems, reinforcement learning and convolutional networks. By modeling the kinematics of a commercial didactic robot, an adaptive genetic algorithm used to optimize the trajectories is developed, presenting trajectories generated by polynomial interpolation, traditional and adaptive genetic algorithm, thus analyzing the possibility of reducing the total distance covered and other metrics by the technique adopted.

In particular, there is increasing concern about 'killer robots', drones that can kill on their own, and intelligent autonomous vehicles such as driverless cars. Recent incidents involving autonomous vehicles in which humans have been killed or injured have raised questions about whether such vehicles can have an ethical dimension to their behavior so that they know when it is right or wrong to take over control from a human driver or hand control back, no matter how advanced their embedded artificial intelligence and sensor technology. This paper describes a fuzzy control approach to machine ethics that shows how it is possible for an ethics architecture to be part of a control system to calculate when taking over from a human driver is morally justified. One major advantage of the approach is that such an ethical reasoning architecture can generate its own data for learning moral rules and thereby reduce the possibility of picking up human biases and prejudices.;;;;;;;;;15;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-1786-7;;;;2019;;;;;;;231;236;;;;;6;"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering";BP3XO;WOS:000549940000047;;;;;2020-12-16;

However, deep learning is resource-intensive and the theory is not yet well developed. For small games, simple classical table-based Q-learning might still be the algorithm of choice. General Game Playing (GGP) provides a good testbed for reinforcement learning to research AGI. Q-learning is one of the canonical reinforcement learning methods, and has been used by (Banerjee & Stone, IJCAI 2007) in GGP. In this paper we implement Q-learning in GGP for three small-board games (Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, Hex), to allow comparison to Banerjee et al. We find that Q-learning converges to a high win rate in GGP. For the epsilon-greedy strategy, we propose a first enhancement, the dynamic epsilon algorithm. In addition, inspired by (Gelly & Silver, ICML 2007) we combine online search (Monte Carlo Search) to enhance offline learning, and propose QM-learning for GGP. Both enhancements improve the performance of classical Q-learning. In this work, GGP allows us to show, if augmented by appropriate enhancements, that classical table-based Q-learning can perform well in small games.;"[Wang, Hui; Emmerich, Michael; Plaat, Aske] Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Adv Comp Sci, Leiden, Netherlands";Wang, H (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Adv Comp Sci, Leiden, Netherlands.;h.wang.13@liacs.leidenuniv.nl;;;China Scholarship Council (CSC), CSCChina Scholarship Council [201706990015];HuiWang acknowledges financial support from the China Scholarship Council (CSC), CSC No. 201706990015.;;23;0;0;0;0;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;1865-0929;1865-0937;"978-3-030-31978-6; 978-3-030-31977-9";COMM COM INF SC;;;2019;1021;;;;;;138;150;;10.1007/978-3-030-31978-6_11;;;13;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP4CD;WOS:000550798800011;;;;;2020-12-16;

This paper presents a comparative evaluation of some popular AI-based tools - feedforward neural networks (FFNN), radial basis function neural networks (RBFN) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The power system faults were triggered at various locations of a MATLAB simulated IEEE distribution network to generate training and testing fault data. ANFIS demonstrated a better fault location accuracy compared to other tools. A classical impedance-based algorithm is also presented in this work to surface its multi-estimation setback for multi-terminal distribution networks, which in contrast demonstrates the advantage of modern AI-based network models over classical electrical circuit-based network models. The detection capabilities of fault type classification of feedforward neural networks were better than other tools. RBFN models exhibited faster learning than other tools. The automated fault location enables the substation maintenance crew to preliminarily estimate the locus of fault event sitting in the substation and then can undertake swift search for fault landmarks. Thus, automated fault location with higher accuracy reduces outage duration for affected customers and amount of power drainage into fault sinks, thereby contributing towards power system reliability and economy.;"[Yellagoud, Surender K.] Jawaharlal Nehru Technol Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hyderabad, India; [Talluri, Purnachandra R.] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Warangal, Andhra Pradesh, India";Yellagoud, SK (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Technol Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hyderabad, India.;"vivek3ht@gmail.com; talluripurna@yahoo.com";;;;;;19;0;0;1;1;ACTA PRESS;CALGARY;2509 DIEPPE AVE SW, BLDG B6, STE 101, CALGARY, AB T3E 7J9, CANADA;1078-3466;1710-2243;;INT J POWER ENERGY S;Int.

However, conventional Radiomics analysis suffers from insufficiently expressive hand-crafted features. Recently, emerging deep learning techniques, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs), dominate recent research in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CADx). Unfortunately, as black-box predictors, we argue that CNNs are diagnosing voxels (or pixels), rather than lesions; in other words, visual saliency from a trained CNN is not necessarily concentrated on the lesions. On the other hand, classification in clinical applications suffers from inherent ambiguities: radiologists may produce diverse diagnosis on challenging cases. To this end, we propose a controllable and explainable Probabilistic Radiomics framework, by combining the Radiomics analysis and probabilistic deep learning. In our framework, 3D CNN feature is extracted upon lesion region only, then encoded into lesion representation, by a controllable Non-local Shape Analysis Module (NSAM) based on self-attention. Inspired from variational auto-encoders (VAEs), an Ambiguity PriorNet is used to approximate the ambiguity distribution over human experts. The final diagnosis is obtained by combining the ambiguity prior sample and lesion representation, and the whole network named DenseSharp+ is end-to-end trainable.

As Artificial Intelligent (AI) has a high-speed computation and adaptively to big data, it used to analyses and represents the data to employers in an easy way so they can make their decisions effectively. An upcoming challenge is raised where if the new candidates for a vacancy will give the expected performance based on the hiring criteria's or not, and how to hire a candidate that will while dealing with the hiring process? Employers are concerned with the performance evaluation of their current employees, but it is a challenge knowing the performance of new candidates before hiring. This study is proposing a follow-up conceptual model of using Artificial Intelligent (AI) in the hiring process with the using of performance management and social screening to predict the new candidate expected performance by analyzing historical performances and conditions of employees. This method will give an additional parameter that assists the decision makers in the hiring process. Although this method is a step forward to eliminate bad hiring, but it is requiring a huge historical data including the tracking of the performance, personal information collected from several sources like surveys and social Media and employees conditions related to the time of old and current employees, to give results that are more efficient and accurate.;"[Mahmoud, Ali A.] Princess Sumaya Univ Technol, ESE King Hussein Sch Comp Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Amman, Jordan; [Shawabkeh, Tahani A.

In this context, it is not surprising that research efforts are directed towards studying human's creativity in an attempt to understand how humans produce creative content, and in what sense does it differ from cognitive content. The idea we are proposing in this research is that we may to a certain level, though humble, emulate some aspects of human creativity. We propose a method which involves designing a program that generates content that could be considered creative. It is important to note that we are not making any claim about matching human creativity level which we believe is limitless and cannot be measured. We shall apply our proposed program on a field that is considered as one of the creative fields in human life and that is based on the idea of combinatorial creativity. The field is culinary arts. The program has been tested to generate creative culinary content using the culinary knowledge of certain Arabic countries and modeling their culinary practice into several steps inspired by the pattern of their process of combining several ingredients. The results were satisfying where only 2 out of 255 were considered as unacceptable results. The program showed its ability in generating creative content in the field of culinary arts.

Most of the data and information were gathered from primary sources. The data and information that were collected from secondary sources needed the intervention of the human factor to process, analyse and extract meaning from them. As technology evolved, most of today's data and information is generated and stored in digital format - this period known as Digital Age. Digitized ion is a process that generates a huge amount of data that cannot be analysed in real-time by human users. This context has led to the accelerated development of solutions that process and analyses a huge volume of data that bears the generic name of cognitive solutions. ' Cognitization' was a logical step in the digitization advancement and expansion of gobbling. IBM's Cognitive Business (IBM, 2015), as an application of the Watson platform, revolutionizes how to obtain, analyse, store and use digital information for economic and financial decisions. The Microsoft Brainwave (Microsoft, 2017) project promises access to real-time artificial intelligence (AI) services, especially in the financial and research environment. Immersive cognitive systems allow corporations to lead from a veritable cockpit or bridge with situational assessment rooms, cognitive boardrooms, immersive classes etc. in which human staff will constantly interact with artificial cognitive agents. For smaller businesses (national, regional), it is estimated that in the coming years, access to AI services over the internet (InternetDeliver AI) will be the standard for the civil business domain (Mary, 2015). In the field of Competitive Intelligence, the goal of practitioners is to collect data and information that they process and analyse, then transform them into intelligence suggesting actions, strategies or decisions. To respond rapidly to the urgent need to collect relevant data and information from an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous environment, as characterized by the current economy, Competitive Intelligence practitioners need to build fast and efficient work systems such as those described above. At the same time, they need to develop new skills, such as agility and attention. Attention is a mandatory condition for Competitive Intelligence practitioners while agility often depends on the ability to maintain a high level of attention (focus) and at the same time the rapid response to the stimulus (alertness). The ability of analysts to remain focused on a particular goal is what ensures their success or failure. For the Intelligence Competitive practitioner to remain relevant, efficient and to keep up with an environment that contains a large volume of information, while the field of Artificial Intelligence develops, it needs to enhance his cognitive abilities through optimization, stimulation and augmentation. Among these three methods, the one that represents the subject of this paper is augmentation. Augmentation implies enhancing the cognitive abilities within while optimizing and stimulating the factors of intervention. For optimization, intervention can be done through pharmacological means such as nootropic drugs or smart drugs. Stimulation can be obtained through neuro-technology: electrical and magnetic transcranial stimulation (Wingeier, 2017). Another way to classify brain stimulation methods is to divide them into two broad categories: invasive methods and non- invasive methods. Invasive methods involve direct brain intervention such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) and have been used for learning enhancement (Clark & Parasuraman, 2014; Suthana & Fried, 2014). The most popular non-invasive brain-stimulation technologies are transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and focused ultrasound (FUS). While the three of them - optimization, stimulation, augmentation - are means of brain enhancement, augmentation is non-invasive, risk- free and it is the only one that is based on neuroplasticity - which means the ability of the brain to learn new things. Much recent research (Edmonds & Tenenbaum, 2012) has led to amazing understandings about the relationship between pleasure, learning and motivation in the brain. It is now known that there is a centre of pleasure in the medial part of the prefrontal cortex, right in the middle of the forehead, a part that is involved in the process of focus attention, alertness, learning and that motivates us to go forward. Pleasure and happiness are the basic motivators for our lives. We want to expand happiness and pleasure develops momentum. We learn to associate many types of events with these feelings. Living in a sense of happiness, we change our vision of life, the reaction to events and situations, our memory, our learning and our general well-being. When we are happy, we connect much more easily to others. As we know, the maintenance of positive emotions stimulates health while maintenance of the negative benefits of the disease. Mental training is based on biofeedback - it is a method that uses the mind to control a function of the body that is normally regulated automatically, such as body temperature, heart rate, happiness and pleasure etc. to increase the production of high-frequency (gamma) brainwaves from the medial part of the prefrontal cortex. In short, people can teach their brains how to raise their attention, alertness happiness and other positive feelings that are associated with the production of chemicals (endorphins and dopamine). Based on a device that measures the frequency of brain waves and software that interprets this information, we can tell when the brain (based on the fact that certain activities and certain states are associated with certain types of waves) is concentrated when it secretes dopamine when it is happy and other. This type of training is called neuro-feedback. Advances in neuroscience and the development of neuro-technologies have progressively raised new and unique ethical issues (neuroethics), in addition to the more traditional aspects related to human participation in research studies. The most important ethical issues are related to: Mind Reading and Privacy; Agency, Responsibility and Liability; Safety and Invasiveness of Brain Enhancement, Society";"[Dinu, Daniel-Gabriel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Business Adm Doctoral Sch, Bucharest, Romania; [Stoian-Karadeli, Andreea] Mihai Viteazul Natl Intelligence Acad, Bucharest, Romania";Dinu, DG (corresponding author), Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Business Adm Doctoral Sch, Bucharest, Romania.;;;;;;;4;0;0;1;1;EUROMED PRESS;MARSEILLE CEDEX 9;RUE ANTOINE BOURDELLE, DOMAINE DE LUMINY BP 921, MARSEILLE CEDEX 9, 13 288, FRANCE;2547-8516;;978-9963-711-81-9;EUROMED ACAD BUS CON;;;2019;;;;;;;1619;1621;;;;;3;"Business; Management";Business & Economics;BP3LD;WOS:000548057800134;;;;;2020-12-16;

Therefore, the intelligent and proper management of these resources is a pressing matter in terms of cost savings. Among the possible alternatives for optimisation, the one regarding electricity consumption stands out due to its strong influence on the expenses account. In general, this type of optimisation can be carried out from two different perspectives: one that concerns the efficient use of energy itself and the other related to the proper adjustment of the electricity contract so that it meets the infrastructure needs while avoiding extra costs derived from poorly sized bills. This paper describes the application of an artificial intelligence based methodology for the optimisation of the parameters contracted in the electricity tariff in the Spanish market. This technique is able to adjust the power term needed so that the global economic cost derived from energy consumption is significantly reduced. The papers discusses the impact that this proposal may have on a demand response scenario associated to load shifting practices within university buildings.

Firstly, the building energy prediction with various time steps resolution are perform using methods such as Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Decision Trees (DT). Secondly, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is used to unlock the building energy flexibility by performing classification assuming three different levels of flexibility.

Rare and aggressive tumors can have a lot of swelling associated with them. Some tumors may grow at a slower rate and may not be visible and grow over a long period of time. It becomes difficult to perform manual segmentation on MR images in a given period of time and highly dependent on the expertise and experience of the operator. In this paper, authors have proposed to detect tumor using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and U-Net based deep convolutional networks. The implementation is on Pytorch an open source machine, learning library developed by the Facebook artificial intelligence research group. Pytorch is basically the combination of two languages, python, and torch.

Evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms (EMOAs) can be effective in solving MOKPs. Though, they often face difficulties due to the loss of solution diversity and poor scalability. To address those issues, our study [2] proposes to generate candidate solutions by artificial neural networks. This is intended to provide intelligence to the search. As gradient-based learning cannot be used when target values are unknown, neuroevolution is adapted to adjust the neural network parameters. The proposal is implemented within a state-of-the-art EMOA and benchmarked against traditional search operators base on a binary crossover. The obtained experimental results indicate a superior performance of the proposed approach. Furthermore, it is advantageous in terms of scalability and can be readily incorporated into different EMOAs.;"[Denysiuk, Roman] CEA, LIST, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Gaspar-Cunha, Antonio] Univ Minho, Guimaraes, Portugal; [Delbem, Alexandre C.

Although they differ in implementation details, they all share a common structure: an update rule is applied to each solution, followed by a drop rule that decides whether to keep the updated solution or not. In this poster we explore the idea of automatically generating swarm-like optimizers. Our proposal is divided in two stages: First we decompose popular, human-crafted, swarm-like optimizers such as PSO, CS, ABC (as well as DE/GA) into a list of basic rules. Second, we use Grammatical Evolution to procedurally generate variations on this base structure by recombining these operators. We generate three instances of algorithms, and observe that they have comparable performance to DE and PSO.

With this position paper we argue that, on a landscape analysis basis, the benchmark design problem will form a substantial part of the next-generation of automated, on-demand algorithm design principles.;"[Dreo, Johann; Semet, Yann] Thales Res & Technol, Palaiseau, France; [Doerr, Carola] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Paris, France";Dreo, J (corresponding author), Thales Res & Technol, Palaiseau, France.;"johann.dreo@thalesgroup.com; Carola.Doerr@lip6.fr; yann.semet@thalesgroup.com";;;;;;15;0;0;0;0;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA;;;978-1-4503-6748-6;;;;2019;;;;;;;1419;1420;;10.1145/3319619.3326821;;;2;Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications;Mathematics;BP0XM;WOS:000538328100255;;Green Published;;;2020-12-16;

Any string can be uniquely factored into Lyndon words and efficient algorithms exist to perform the factorization process in linear time and constant space. Lyndon words find wide-ranging applications including string matching and pattern inference in bioinformatics. Here we investigate the impact of permuting the alphabet ordering on the resulting factorization and demonstrate significant variations in the numbers of factors obtained. We also propose an evolutionary algorithm to find optimal orderings of the alphabet to enhance this factorization process and illustrate the impact of different operators. The flexibility of such an approach is illustrated by our use of five fitness functions which produce different factorizations suitable for different downstream tasks.;"[Clare, Amanda; Daykin, Jacqueline W.; Mills, Thomas; Zarges, Christine] Aberystwyth Univ, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales; [Daykin, Jacqueline W.] Kings Coll London, London, England; [Daykin, Jacqueline W.] Stellenbosch Univ, Stellenbosch, South Africa";Clare, A (corresponding author), Aberystwyth Univ, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales.;"afc@aber.ac.uk; jwd6@aber.ac.uk; Thomasandrewmills@outlook.com; c.zarges@aber.ac.uk";Zarges, Christine/AAV-5043-2020;"Zarges, Christine/0000-0002-2829-4296; Daykin, Jacqueline/0000-0003-1123-8703; Clare, Amanda/0000-0001-8315-3659";;;;18;0;0;0;0;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA;;;978-1-4503-6748-6;;;;2019;;;;;;;1543;1550;;10.1145/3319619.3326872;;;8;Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications;Mathematics;BP0XM;WOS:000538328100272;;Green Published;;;2020-12-16;

A set of statistical techniques are used to discover glucose profiles that identify similar situations in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, and incorporate this knowledge to the models. Glucose time series are divided into 4-hour non-overlapping slots and clustered using the technique based on decision trees called chi-square automatic interaction detection, to classify glucose profiles into groups using two decision variables: day of the week and time slot of the day. The objective is to customize models for different glucose profiles that appear in the patient's day-to-day. Genetic programming models created with glucose values from the original data-set are compared to those of models created with classified glucose values. Significant differences (p-value < 0.05) and associations are observed between the glucose profiles. In general, using classified glucose values in models created with genetic programming, the accuracy of the predictions improves in comparison with those of models created with the original data-set. We concluded that the classification process can be useful to correct and improve habits or clinical therapies in patients, and obtain more accurate models through automatic learning techniques and artificial intelligence.;"[Contador, Sergio; Hidalgo, J.

The identification and characterization of these defects are critical steps in the process of improving the efficiency and reliability of solar cells. In this study, we present the first successful application of machine learning for extraction of defect parameters from temperature- and injection-dependent lifetime spectroscopy (TIDLS). With approximately half a million simulated TIDLS curves, random forest regressors are trained to obtain the defect's energy level and both capture cross-sections. The high correlation coefficient between predicted and simulated values highlights the usefulness of this novel approach. With no prior knowledge of the physical model at work, the regressor learns the physical limitations of that model. This work pioneers the use of machine learning for lifetime spectroscopy, bringing the newest prowess of artificial intelligence to material quality inspection. It opens a new era in the area of defect characterization, as it has the potential to overcome the limitations of current methods, such as dealing with the temperature dependence of various electrical parameters and provide new insights in the theory of lifetime spectroscopy.;"[Buratti, Yoann; Dick, Josef; Quoc Le Gia; Hameiri, Ziv] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia";Buratti, Y (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.;;;;Australian Government through Australian Renewable Energy AgencyAustralian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) [2017/RND001];"This work was supported by the Australian Government through Australian Renewable Energy Agency [ARENA; project 2017/RND001].

YOLOv3, a real-time image-recognition model, was used for object recognition and notification. By combining LINE with the Flask Web application framework, it helps the disabled transmit messages and actively notifies bus drivers. The API server was established using the Flask framework. When the system at the bus stop detects the disabled, the images of the disabled waiting for the bus are transmitted to the server, and the images and related messages are transmitted in real time to the users through the LINE Message API. Passengers can also use the LINE chatbot to enter keywords to confirm the real-time location of the bus. The dynamic bus information comes from the Open Data of the Bureau of Transportation.

This latest attempt at explaining the idea of memes ties it to the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence and tries to show how the mechanism of meme transmission affected the birth of human intelligence (which Dennett calls comprehension). I argue that even though the new version of the theory is not without its merits, it comes with two fatal flaws. First of all, even though on the surface Dennett talks only about words, gestures signs etc., he seems to smuggle in an additional notion of linguistic meaning which remains unexplained. Second of all, he does not provide identity conditions for memes which makes the whole idea of their transmission completely vague.;"[Grabarczyk, Pawel] IT Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Grabarczyk, Pawel] Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland";"Grabarczyk, P (corresponding author), IT Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Grabarczyk, P (corresponding author), Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland.";pagrab@gmail.com;;;National Science Centre in PolandNational Science Center, PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [2014/15/B/HS1/01928];The work on the paper has been financed by the National Science Centre in Poland, thanks to the grant (2014/15/B/HS1/01928).;;15;0;0;0;0;CENTRE PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH;BYDGOSZCZ;UL CZARTORYSKIEGO 15-16, BYDGOSZCZ, 85-222, POLAND;2082-7598;2082-6710;;AVANT;Avant;;2019;10;3;;;;;;;;10.26913/avant.2019.03.29;;;11;Humanities, Multidisciplinary;Arts & Humanities - Other Topics;MH5QQ;WOS:000546783900018;;DOAJ Gold;;;2020-12-16;

Many techniques have been developed for analysis of stock market, however, it remains a challenging problem. One approach is to use deep learning for stock price prediction and some success has been reported in literature with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This paper proposes deep functional link neural network for stock predictions as functional link artificial neural networks (FLANN) are single-layer neural networks which can solve complex problems by generating nonlinear decision boundaries. It is conjectured that deep FLANN would benefit from the ability of deep learning to handle complex problems generated from multiple hidden layers and interconnection of neurons as well as from the inherent capability of single layer FLANN to handle difficult problems. Initial investigations show that average performance of Deep FLANN is better than the single-layer FLANN as well as CNN for prediction of stock prices of a set of companies listed on Korean Stock market.;"[Gaurav, Prashant; Singhal, Abhishek] Amity Univ Uttar Pradesh, Dept CSE, Noida, UP, India; [Mani, Ashish] Amity Univ Uttar Pradesh, Dept EEE, Noida, UP, India";Gaurav, P (corresponding author), Amity Univ Uttar Pradesh, Dept CSE, Noida, UP, India.;"prashantgaurav36@gmail.com; amani@amity.edu";;;;;;26;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-2068-3;;;;2019;;;;;;;508;513;;;;;6;"Automation & Control Systems; Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";"Automation & Control Systems; Energy & Fuels; Engineering";BP3BK;WOS:000546171800092;;;;;2020-12-16;

This indicates that early music learning affects the development of the brain. Also, musicians' neuronal activity is different depending on the played instrument and on the expertise. This difference can be analysed by processing electroencephalographic (EEG) signals through Artificial Intelligence models. This paper explores the feasibility to build an automatic model that distinguishes violinists from pianists based only on their brain signals. To this aim, EEG signals of violinists and pianists are recorded while they play classical music pieces and an Artificial Neural Network is trained through a cloud computing platform to build a binary classifier of segments of these signals. Our model has the best classification performance on 20 seconds EEG segments, but this performance depends on the involved musicians' expertise. Also, the brain signals of a cellist are demonstrated to be more similar to violinists' signals than to pianists' signals. In summary, this paper demonstrates that distinctive information is present in the two types of musicians' brain signals, and that this information can be detected even by an automatic model working with a basic EEG equipment.;"[Coro, Gianpaolo; Masetti, Giulio] Ist Sci & Tecnol Informaz A Faedo, Pisa, Italy; [Bonhoeffer, Philipp; Betcher, Michael] Auditorium Compagnia Montecastelli, Pisa, Italy";Coro, G (corresponding author), Ist Sci & Tecnol Informaz A Faedo, Pisa, Italy.;"gianpaolo.coro@isti.cnr.it; giulio.masetti@isti.cnr.it; bonhop1705@googlemail.com; m.betcher@gmx.de";Coro, Gianpaolo/AAW-1547-2020;Coro, Gianpaolo/0000-0001-7232-191X;;;;58;0;0;0;0;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-30487-4; 978-3-030-30486-7";LECT NOTES COMPUT SC;;;2019;11727;;;;;;123;137;;10.1007/978-3-030-30487-4_11;;;15;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP3HE;WOS:000546494000011;;;;;2020-12-16;

Although constrained platforms do not have enough processing capabilities to train a sophisticated deep learning model, like convolutional neural networks (CNN), they are already capable of performing inference locally by using a previously trained embedded model. This approach enables numerous advantages such as privacy, response latency, and no real time network dependence. Still, the use of a local CNN model on constrained platforms is restricted by its storage size. Most of the research in CNNs has focused on increasing network depth to improve accuracy. In the text classification area, deep models were proposed with excellent performance but relying on large architectures with thousands of parameters, and consequently, high storage size. We propose to modify the structure of the Very Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (VDCNN) model to reduce its storage size while keeping the model performance. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of Temporal Depthwise Separable Convolutions and Global Average Pooling in the network parameters, storage size, dedicated hardware dependence, and accuracy. The proposed squeezed model (SVDCNN) is between 10x and 20x smaller than the original version, depending on the network depth, maintaining a maximum disk size of 6MB. Regarding accuracy, the network experiences a loss between 0.4% and 1.3% in the accuracy performance while obtains lower latency over non-dedicated hardware and higher inference time ratio compared to the baseline model.;"[Duque, Andrea B.; Santos, Lua Lazaro J.; Macedo, David; Zanchettin, Cleber] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Ctr Informat CIn, Recife, PE, Brazil";Duque, AB (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pernambuco, Ctr Informat CIn, Recife, PE, Brazil.;"abd@cin.ufpe.br; lljs@cin.ufpe.br; dlm@cin.ufpe.br; cz@cin.ufpe.br";"Macedo, David/U-7135-2019; Zanchettin, Cleber/C-3196-2017";"Macedo, David/0000-0002-2527-4548; Zanchettin, Cleber/0000-0001-6421-9747";"CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); FACEPE";We would like to thank CNPq and FACEPE (Brazilian research agencies) for the financial support.;;23;2;2;0;0;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-30487-4; 978-3-030-30486-7";LECT NOTES COMPUT SC;;;2019;11727;;;;;;193;207;;10.1007/978-3-030-30487-4_16;;;15;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP3HE;WOS:000546494000016;;;;;2020-12-16;

In some hospitals, medical personals want to improve their statists by decreasing the number of patients dying in the hospital. The research is focused on the mortality prediction of measurable outcomes, including the risk of complications & length of hospital stay. The duration spent in the hospital of the patient plays an important role both for patients & healthcare providers, influenced by numerous factors. LOS (length of stay) in critical care has great importance, both to the patient experience as well as the cost of care and is influenced by the complex environmental factors of the Hospitals. LOS is a parameter that is used to identify the extremity of illness & health-related resource utilization. This paper provides the improved prediction rate that a patient survives or dies in the range of length of stay in the hospital. It also anchors the analytical methods for the length of stay and mortality prediction.;"[Verma, Akash] Bhilai Inst Technol, Dept CSE, Durg, India; [Goyal, Shreya] Natl Inst Technol, Dept CSE, Jalandhar, Punjab, India; [Thakur, Shridhar Kumar] Galgotias Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Greater Noida, India; [Gupta, Archit] ABES Engn Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Ghaziabad, India; [Gupta, Indrajeet] Bennett Univ, Dept CSE, Greater Noida, India";Verma, A (corresponding author), Bhilai Inst Technol, Dept CSE, Durg, India.;"akashverma.av98@gmail.com; shreyag.2199@gmail.com; thakur.sridhar1@gmail.com; architg380@gmail.com; indrajeet7830@gmail.com";;;;;;6;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2377-6927;;978-1-7281-4392-7;INT CONF ADV COMPU;;;2019;;;;;;;230;234;;;;;5;"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";"Computer Science; Engineering";BP3IE;WOS:000546617100039;;;;;2020-12-16;

This worrisome decline in the population of bees threatens agricultural, and human welfare. Therefore, protecting the population of bees is a major concern. In this perspective, the Makers' Beehives project aims at developing an innovative beekeeping system capable of automatically assessing the health and threat status of honey-bees' colonies by means of Internet of things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Indeed, compared to a select few research groups in industry that can leverage access to their global-scale production networks in their data-driven efforts to develop and evaluate learning models, academic researchers not only struggle to get their hands on real-world data sets but find it almost impossible to adequately train and assess their learning models under realistic conditions. In this paper, we argue that when appropriately instrumented and properly managed, enterprise networks in the form of university or campus networks can serve as real-world production networks and can, because of their ubiquity, help create a more level playing field for academic researchers. Their various limitations notwithstanding, as real-world production networks, such enterprise networks can (i) serve as unique sources for some of the rich data that will enable these researchers to influence or advance the current state-of-the-art in AI/ML for networking and (ii) also function as much-needed test beds where newly developed AI/ML-based tools can be evaluated or road-tested prior to their actual deployment in the production network. We discuss new research challenges that arise from this proposed dual role of campus networks and comment on the opportunities our proposal affords for both academic and industry researchers to benefit from the advantages and limitations of their respective production environments in their common quest to advance the development and evaluation of AI/ML-based tools to the point where they can be deployed in practice.;"[Gupta, Arpit] UC Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Mac-Stoker, Chris; Willinger, Walter] NIKSUN Inc, Princeton, NJ USA";Gupta, A (corresponding author), UC Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.;;;;"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CNS-1748793]; NSF at Columbia University [CNS-1413978]";We thank our shepherd Behnaz Arzani and the anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback.

Among the factors that stimulate the development of this class of software systems, it should be mentioned that the increasing role of their use to solve poorly structured and difficult formalized tasks in the conditions of uncertainty, inaccuracy, incompleteness and inconsistency of the source data, the need to take into account the varied and dynamically changing parameters. In such circumstances, it is important to develop many parametric methods for evaluating complex objects and alternative solutions to improve the performance of multitenant system feeds. This research developed a multi-parameter method for evaluating the state of a multi-antenna radio communication channel using a fuzzy set theory. The scientific novelty of the proposed method consists in the fact that the fuzzy evaluation models included in the proposed method are proposed for the creation of software to support the choice of decisions, taking into account the hierarchical structure, interoperability and different significance of the evaluated indicators. According to the results of the research, it is found that the proposed method allows to increase the speed of estimation of the channel status of multi-antenna systems by up to 25% on the average, depending on the status of the channel fuzzy sets) and is able to adapt to the signaling environment in the channel by learning neural networks.;"[Mohammed, Amin Salih] Salahaddin Univ, Lebanese French Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Erbil, Iraq; [Andrii, Shyshatskyi] Cent Scientifically Res Inst, Res Lab Elect Warfare Dev, Kiev, Ukraine; [Ahmed, Ahmed Najat] Lebanese French Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Erbil, Iraq; [Olha, Dublian] Natl Univ Def Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine; [Owaid, Salman Rasheed] Kuliyyah Al Maarif Univ Coll, Al Anbar, Iraq";Mohammed, AS (corresponding author), Salahaddin Univ, Lebanese French Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Erbil, Iraq.;"kakshar@lfu.edu.krd; ierikon12@gmail.com; a.afandy@lfu.edu.krd; Olgadublian@gmail.com; owaidsalman@yahoo.com";Mohammed, Amin Salih/P-8384-2018;Mohammed, Amin Salih/0000-0002-2993-6182;;;;23;1;1;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-3778-0;;;;2019;;;;;;;375;381;;;;;7;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP3BX;WOS:000546185300073;;;;;2020-12-16;

Therefore, the introduction of artificial intelligence into the judicial field is an inevitable trend. This paper incorporates deep learning into intelligent judicial sentencing and proposes a comprehensive network fusion model based on massive legal documents. The proposed method combines multiple networks, e.g., recurrent neural network and convolutional neural network, in the procedure of sentencing prediction. Specially, we use text classification and post-classification regression to predict the defendant's conviction, articles of law related to the case and prison term.

An important guide for such changes are the sustainable development goals (SDG's) adopted by the United Nations. SDG 17 calls for partnerships built on shared vision and goals. In this study, statistics reveal the need, in adult education, for more strategic transversal skills, such as communication, interaction, networking, global international communication, and social participation skills, rather than formal instruction. A case study is presented illustrating a real example of how a tripartite collaboration between schools, institutions, and enterprises can work to engage students around the SDGs. The project was a virtual reality exploration of the planet Mars, in which young adult students at risk of exclusion were engaged to collaborate, solve problems, and work toward gender equality.

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for invariants synthesis have gradually been developed and have shown its excellent performance. However, when positive samples are distributed among multiple clusters, the algorithm for intersection of half space based on SVM can not generate the candidate invariants. In order to solve this problem, a new modified algorithm, based on and k-means++ and SVM, is proposed. After sampling, our algorithm adopts k-means++ to cluster the positive samples. Then this algorithm uses SVM to distinguish each positive sample cluster from all negative samples to compute the candidate invariants. Finally, a set of theories founded on Hoare logic are adopted to check whether the candidate invariants are true invariants. If the check succeeds, the true invariants have been found. Otherwise, we should collect more samples and repeat our algorithm.

Twin-Delayed DDPG (TD3) is a recent breakthrough smart AI model of a Deep Reinforcement Learning which combines the state-of-the-art techniques in Artificial Intelligence, including continuous Double Deep Q-Learning, Policy Gradient and Actor-Critic. These Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches have the capabilities to train an Intelligent agent to interact with an environment with automatic feature engineering, that is, requiring minimal domain knowledge. Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (TD3) was built on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG). During the implementation of the TD3 model, we used a two-layer feedforward neural network of 400 and 300 hidden nodes respectively, with Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) as an activation function between each layer for both the Actor and Critics, and then a final tanh unit following the output of the Actor. Overall, we developed six (6) neural networks. The Critic received both the state and action as input to the first layer. Both the network parameters were updated using the Adam optimizer. The implementation of the TD3 algorithm was made possible by using the pybullet continuous control environment which was interfaced through the OpenAI Gym. The idea behind the Twin-Delayed DDPG (TD3) is to reduce overestimation bias in Deep Q-Learning with discrete actions which are ineffective in an Actor-Critic domain setting. After exposing the Agent to training for 500,000 iterations, the Agent then achieved a Maximum Average Reward over the evaluation time-step of approximately 1891. Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) has prominently improved both the learning speed and performance of the DDPG in a challenging task in a continuous control setting.;"[Dankwa, Stephen] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Automat Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Wenfeng] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Automat Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China";Dankwa, S (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Automat Engn, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;"nabistephen@gmail.com; winfirms@uestc.edu.cn";;;;;;14;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-2871-9;;;;2019;;;;;;;172;175;;;;;4;"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Telecommunications";BP2XS;WOS:000545638300036;;;;;2020-12-16;

Our contribution is the first deep architecture that tackles predictive domain adaptation, able to leverage over the information brought by the auxiliary domains through a graph.

Intelligent systems must be socially intelligent in order to comprehend human intents and maintain a rich level of interaction with humans. Human language offers a unique unconstrained approach to probe through questions and reason through answers about social situations. This unconstrained approach extends previous attempts to model social intelligence through numeric supervision (e.g. sentiment and emotions labels). In this paper, we introduce the Social-IQ, an unconstrained benchmark specifically designed to train and evaluate socially intelligent technologies. By providing a rich source of open-ended questions and answers, Social-IQ opens the door to explainable social intelligence. The dataset contains rigorously annotated and validated videos, questions and answers, as well as annotations for the complexity level of each question and answer. Social-IQ contains 1, 250 natural in-the-wild social situations, 7, 500 questions and 52, 500 correct and incorrect answers. Although humans can reason about social situations with very high accuracy (95.08%), existing state-of-the-art computational models struggle on this task.

To this end, we need systems that can understand social relationships in diverse social contexts. Inferring the social context in a given visual scene not only involves recognizing objects, but also demands a more in-depth understanding of the relationships and attributes of the people involved. To achieve this, one computational approach for representing human relationships and attributes is to use an explicit knowledge graph, which allows for high-level reasoning. We introduce a novel end-to-end-trainable neural network that is capable of generating a Social Relationship Graph - a structured, unified representation of social relationships and attributes - from a given input image. Our Social Relationship Graph Generation Network (SRG-GN) is the first to use memory cells like Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to iteratively update the social relationship states in a graph using scene and attribute context.

As the countermeasure to this problem, deep neural networks with ternarized weights (re.,-1, 0, +1) have been widely explored to greatly reduce the model size and computational cost, with limited accuracy degradation. In this work, we propose a novel ternarized neural network training method which simultaneously optimizes both weights and quantizer during training, differentiating from prior works.

The resulting neural network is known as a sparse neural network. More recent work has demonstrated the remarkable result that certain sparse DNNs can train to the same precision as dense DNNs at lower runtime and storage cost. An intriguing class of these sparse DNNs is the X-Nets, which are initialized and trained upon a sparse topology with neither reference to a parent dense DNN nor subsequent pruning. We present an algorithm that deterministically generates RadiX-Nets: sparse DNN topologies that, as a whole, are much more diverse than X-Net topologies, while preserving X-Nets' desired characteristics.

Incorporating knowledge into Deep Neural Networks (DNN), that are purely data driven, can potentially improve the overall performance of the system. This paper presents such a fusion scheme, DeepEX, that combines these seemingly parallel streams of AI, for multistep time-series forecasting problems. DeepEX achieves this in a way that merges best of both worlds along with a reduction in the amount of data required to train these models. This direction has been explored in the past for single step forecasting by opting for a residual learning scheme. We analyze the shortcomings of this simple residual learning scheme and enable DeepEX to not only avoid these shortcomings but also scale to multi-step prediction problems. DeepEX is tested on two commonly used time series forecasting datasets, CIF2016 and NN5, where it achieves competitive results even when trained on a reduced set of training examples. Incorporating external knowledge to reduce network's reliance on large amount of accurately labeled data will prove to be extremely effective in training of neural networks for real-world applications where the dataset sizes are small and labeling is expensive.;"[Chattha, Muhammad Ali; Munir, Mohsin; Dengel, Andreas] TU Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Chattha, Muhammad Ali; Siddiqui, Shoaib Ahmed; Munir, Mohsin; van Elst, Ludger; Dengel, Andreas; Ahmed, Sheraz] German Res Ctr Artificial Intelligence DFKI GmbH, Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Chattha, Muhammad Ali; Siddiqui, Shoaib Ahmed; Malik, Muhammad Imran] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci SEECS, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Malik, Muhammad Imran] Natl Ctr Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning Lab, Islamabad, Pakistan";"Chattha, MA (corresponding author), TU Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany.; Chattha, MA; Ahmed, S (corresponding author), German Res Ctr Artificial Intelligence DFKI GmbH, Kaiserslautern, Germany.; Chattha, MA (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci SEECS, Islamabad, Pakistan.";"muhammad_ali.chattha@dfki.de; sheraz.ahmed@dfki.de";;"Munir, Mohsin/0000-0001-7818-0361; Siddiqui, Shoaib Ahmed/0000-0003-4600-7331";;;;21;0;0;0;0;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-30484-3; 978-3-030-30483-6";LECT NOTES COMPUT SC;;;2019;11728;;;;;;639;651;;10.1007/978-3-030-30484-3_51;;;13;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;BP3AP;WOS:000545998100051;;;;;2020-12-16;

As a result of the theoretical study, an empirical gap was identified, resulting from the lack of studies addressing the issues of process maturity in organizations using artificial intelligence. The research question was constructed in the work. RQ: What is the level of process maturity of the organization on the Israeli market that has declared the implementation of artificial intelligence technology? Empirical proceedings were carried out on a sample of 19 non-probabilistically selected organizations functioning in Israel. The multi-dimensional process maturity assessment model (MMPM) was used to assess the level of implementation of process solutions, adjusted to the specificity of the given sector. The study used research methods, such as: quantitative and qualitative bibliometric analysis, survey and statistical methods. The first chapter presents the results of the quantitative and qualitative bibliometric analysis. Then, the next chapter characterized the concept of process maturity and described the applied MMPM methodology. The third chapter describes the population of the surveyed organizations on the Israeli market. The next chapter presents the detailed results of the empirical proceedings. The last chapter contains the study results and discussion. The article ended with a summary, which included directions for further proceedings and outlined the limitations resulting from the adopted research methodology.

Therefore, the authors utilize one of its branch for doing a better diagnosis in High Voltage Equipment which is Artificial Neural Networks. This method was chosen because it has been proven to have a high level of accuracy on pattern recognition. Database compilation is done by taking PD data with PD sources in the form of corona and PD in oil insulation at three different voltage levels. The recognition of PD patterns is done by looking at the PD signal phase pattern while the PD signal assessment is done by looking at the maximum amplitude for both positive and negative PD and also the number of PD appearances in each cycle. This important information will be used in the process of making ANN, then the network will be used for pattern recognition and assessment of PD signals in the application made.;"[Lumba, Lunnetta Safura; Khayam, Umar; Maulana, Rian] Inst Teknol Bandung, Sch Elect Engn & Informat, Bandung, Indonesia";Lumba, LS (corresponding author), Inst Teknol Bandung, Sch Elect Engn & Informat, Bandung, Indonesia.;"lunnettasafura@gmail.com; umar@hv.ee.itb.ac.id; rian.maulana@students.itb.ac.id";;Lumba, Lunnetta Safura/0000-0001-6331-6270;;;;5;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;2155-6822;;978-1-7281-2418-6;INT CONF ELECT ENG;;;2019;;;;;;;239;243;;;;;5;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";"Computer Science; Engineering";BP2UT;WOS:000545264500043;;;;;2020-12-16;

Currently, classification based on the above features is being carried out mainly by manuals due to farmers' awareness of low accuracy, high costs, health effects and high costs, costly economically inferior. The internal quality of the mango such as sweetness, hardness, age, brittleness... is very important but is only estimated by external or human-perceived evaluation. Therefore, it is necessary to use artificial neural networks to solve this problem. This study was conducted on three main commercial mango species of Vietnam to find out the method of classification of mango with the best quality and accuracy. World studies of mango classification according to color, size, volume and almost done in the laboratory but not yet applied in practice. The quality assessment of mango fruit has not been resolved. Application of image processing technology, computer vision combined with artificial intelligence in the problem of mango classification or poor quality. The goal of the study is to create a system that can classify mangoes in terms of color, volume, size, shape and fruit density. The classification system using image processing incorporates artificial intelligence including the use of CCD cameras, C language programming, computer vision and artificial neural networks. The system uses the captured mango image, processing the split layer to determine the mass, volume and defect on the mango fruit surface.

They are a group of clients that constantly support your company because your video games are fun. Videogames are most entertaining when the difficulty level is a good match for the player's skill, increasing the player engagement. However, not all players are equally proficient, so some kind of difficulty selection is required. In this paper, we will present Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA), a recently arising research topic, which aims to develop an automated difficulty selection mechanism that keeps the player engaged and properly challenged, neither bored nor overwhelmed. We will present some recent research addressing this issue, as well as an overview of how to implement it.

To that end, this work explores gesture recognition through a low-cost capacitive sensor matrix overlayed on a rehabilitation activity table. For gesture recognition, a convolutional long short-term memory (C-LSTM) neural network structure is applied and hyper-parameters are varied to determine what resources are necessary to perform classification tasks. The 8 X 8 mutual capacitive sensor array (CSA) is constructed with low-cost copper adhesive. The designed capacitive sensors capture hand motions performed by patients during rehabilitative exercise. The motions cause changes in the electric field that is quantified through sampling the changing capacitance between the copper tape electrodes. An MSP430 MCU computes the capacitance-to-digital conversion at a 50 Hz sampling rate. To identify low computation cost models for the C-LSTM neural network, we evaluate different numbers of capacitor sensors, kernels, convolutional layers, and hidden nodes.

It sets before higher education institutions and all interested persons (employers, customers) such tasks as orientation of educational process to the results of education and changing forms of its results representation into the competencies acquired by the graduate (has to know and be able to do). A technology is being developed where at the request of the economic sector, using the ontological technologies, the training process is restructured to reduce the time required to obtain the estimated number of personnel with the competencies required by employers. The ontology contains competencies from different fields of knowledge which makes it possible to describe the level of today graduate readiness. That allows carrying out the effective formalized search of candidates with the necessary profile and necessary qualification level. It is proposed to develop and implement a modern open educational platform that would help to eliminate the isolation of the educational process from the requirements of modern professional standards and to accelerate the interaction of all participants of the development and updating of federal state educational standards process. It will not only improve the speed and efficiency of training a specialist of any level of education according to competencies requirements, but also provide operational information and methodical support of the preparation process. The ontology of the educational process constructed on the base of the master's degree training allows to develop general requirements. The professional competency model of the specialist needed by the employers is designed in accordance with these requirements.

These algorithms are based on the use of a set of binary masks of a set of examination parameter states, classified by parameter sets for each type of medical examination. The amount of medical examinations for patient in a hospital differs by a more comprehensive set of examinations. And the amount of fuzzy data generated is significantly higher than in outpatient diagnostics. To solve problems associated with getting a clinical diagnosis, predicting the dynamics of a patient's clinical condition and the outcome of a patient's treatment based on medical screenings and examinations the specific algorithms are necessary both at the initial stage and during treatment. These algorithms are coding / decoding, classification and building of structured interconnected models and states of the diagnostic system throughout the entire patient treatment process. A diagnostic system is a set of methods, knowledge and algorithms for solving the problem of decision support in the clinical diagnostics of patients' diseases in a hospital or outpatient clinic. The methods and algorithms presented in the article allow pre-processing fuzzy data of medical examinations of patients in order to optimize and further use fuzzy cognitive models and artificial intelligence methods.

The idea of data decentralization in a binary vector is the basis for a data hyper-size representation. The usage of a traditional data structure presupposes that a binary vector can be divided into two parts where each of them stores some specific value of a data structure field. Such vector division is impossible in a decentralized representation. Each bit of a hyper-size vector stores to some extent structure fields all at once and at the same time all bits of a hyper-size vector are necessary for getting a specific value of a field. Such a representation of data is similar to a traditional one for brain natural neural networks. According to the authors' view point its application will allow to improve the recognition quality and in the future it can lead to the creation of crucially new methodology of machine training and artificial intelligence.;"[Pashchenko, Dmitry; Martyshkin, Alexey] Penza State Technol Univ, Penza, Russia; [Trokoz, Dmitry; Sinev, Mihail] Penza State Univ, Penza, Russia";Pashchenko, D (corresponding author), Penza State Technol Univ, Penza, Russia.;"dmitry.pashchenko@gmail.com; dmitriy.trokoz@gmail.com; alexey314@yandex.ru; mix.sinev@gmail.com";"Martyshkin, Alexey/S-7452-2016; Pashchenko, Dmitry Vl/B-1683-2014; Trokoz, Dmitriy/B-1734-2014";"Martyshkin, Alexey/0000-0002-3358-4394; Pashchenko, Dmitry Vl/0000-0003-4756-0040; Trokoz, Dmitriy/0000-0003-0989-3928";RFBR Grant for Projects of Basic Research [19-07-00516 A.];Research was supported by the RFBR Grant for Projects of Basic Research, Grant No. 19-07-00516 A.;;20;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-6700-8;;;;2019;;;;;;;168;171;;;;;4;"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Multidisciplinary";"Computer Science; Engineering";BP2IQ;WOS:000542910900030;;;;;2020-12-16;

One of the combinations is Q-learning algorithm with one of the deep learning algorithms family of artificial neural networks (ANN) and part of the artificial intelligence science. The combination also becomes a challenge for many researchers because so far it is very difficult to find the right combination in accordance with the case resolved although there are also those that combine with non-ANN. In addition, most RLs only use a single combination, which means that they have not found the ideal combination, whether it should be a single one of the algorithms of ANN or some of it. This study proposes a framework design using the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm that adaptively combines and plays as the actor to calculate the final Q-value value that is updated from a single or multiple Q-value values in a sustainable and dynamic manner.

It is important to consider applications outside of consumer product development, particularly in the realms of local, regional, national, and international policy development. There are intriguing opportunities to apply MLAI techniques to improving the efficiency of standard government (bureaucratic) activities, including policy and diplomatic operations. Growing sociotechnical concerns address the limitations of applying machine learning tools to digital content, due in part to the unintentional (or even explicit) embedding of bias and prejudice into MLAI algorithms that become more difficult for others (particularly those without computer science training) to detect, correct, or reverse. The author's experience provides context to consider issues of MLAI involvement in policy creation in a more subtle operational context. Many MLAI applications are built on the analysis of an existing corpus of outcome products; this reasoning might be applied to the analysis of international policy and standards documents. This paper addresses two challenges to that approach. One is the difference between engineers and policymakers on the nature of debate, evidence, and conflict resolution. A second difference addresses, from the author's experience, emphasis on informal and interim processes, rather than final products, in the development of mutually agreed outcomes in national and international policymaking efforts.";[Caldwell, Barrett S.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA;Caldwell, BS (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.;bscaldwell@purdue.edu;;;Jefferson Science Fellowship program;The author expresses his appreciation to his colleagues at the U.S. Department of State, and the Jefferson Science Fellowship program (managed by the U.S. National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine).

The study addresses the following objectives: 1) development of a structured map of digital technology for higher education; 2) assessment of the extent of development and use of digital technologies in the higher education sphere at present (in developed countries and in a separate region of the Russian Federation - Krasnoyarsk Krai); 3) assessment of the prospects for the development and adoption of digital technologies by 2035 (in developed countries and in Krasnoyarsk Krai). The following research methods were used: 1) a conceptual analysis of scientific publications, forecasts, foresight-studies and analytical reports; 2) expert interviews, 3) a questionnaire based survey (32 experts - researchers, professors, representatives of government and consulting companies). The following core groups of digital technologies are designated: 1) digital solutions for defining the personal goals of education, educational navigation, building a project for an individual educational trajectory; 2) adaptive educational environment for the implementation of an individual educational trajectory; 3) digital solutions for learning activities support; monitoring the results of education; solutions for educational logistics; 4) digital solutions for assessment and certification (personal identification and competency assessment); 5) digital solutions for career support and lifelong education; 6) digital solutions for building and supporting university communities (including teachers, students, graduates, university partners); 7) digital solutions for monitoring and modeling the dynamics of competences at the population level. Each group includes 3-12 technologies, so it is possible to build a detailed map of digital technologies for higher education sphere.

In this sense, the mental model of Internal Learning Cognitive Structures, which aims to enable metacognitive development, is based on the concept of transitivity to explain the passage from one language of knowledge to another and uses artificial intelligence from games to make the process computable. So-called intelligent games have the potential to progressively enable highly complex cognitive functions, constituting an instrument for the evaluation and acquisition of the Internal Learning Cognitive Structures. Among the research done in the context of Computational Neuropedagogy studies in Brazil, there are a project of developing an intelligent game to aid the development of narrative discourse through neuroscientific models. The models involve important concepts of mathematics, biology and linguistics and they are fundamental to the study of cognition within the embodied mind. This research, conducted through an action research methodology with elementary school children, aims to instigate the propagation of Computational Neuropedagogy and present initial data about the construction and design process of an intelligent game that through recursion explores the cognitive function of language, giving the player the widening of his narrative competence.;"[Machado Fernandes, Raquel Moreira] Univ Fed Fluminense, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Machado Fernandes, Raquel Moreira; Rebello da Motta, Claudia Lage] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Informat, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil";"Fernandes, RMM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Fluminense, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.; Fernandes, RMM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Programa Posgrad Informat, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.";;;;;;;7;0;0;0;0;IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT;VALENICA;LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN;2340-1079;;978-84-09-08619-1;INTED PROC;;;2019;;;;;;;7333;7339;;10.21125/inted.2019.1790;;;7;"Education & Educational Research; Psychology, Educational";"Education & Educational Research; Psychology";BP1XC;WOS:000541042202068;;;;;2020-12-16;

The virtual tutorials allow online asynchronous conversations between students and teachers, which, in general, include a time delay. The FAQs allow to answer student questions quickly by showing top and frequent questions. Recently, conversational agents in the form of chatbots have become a reality on social media and messaging apps thanks to the advances on artificial intelligence. Although conversational agents exist since 1965, its term was coined for the first time in 1994 by Michael Mauldin (creator of the first Verbot Julia). Today, chatbots are designed to execute tasks as simple as making the customer purchase easier, or as complex as giving health, technical or legal advice. The use of chatbots is widespread in online businesses as virtual assistants, increasing the confidence of the clients by ensuring better customer service 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Regarding the application of ICTs in an educational context, and the particular case of UACloud at the University of Alicante, the application of chatbots in teaching would facilitate the work of teachers and provide immediate answers to frequently asked questions and virtual tutorials of the students. The chatbot prototype presented in this paper has being trained through a set of tutorials facilitated by several professors from different subjects in the Computer Engineering and Multimedia Engineering Degrees. Through the analysis of the tutorials, the different conversational flows instances have been designed; the training phrases have been extracted and classified according to the type of tutorial; finally, the different intents have been established. We observed that tutorials are a rich source of information to train an educational chatbot. The analysis of the text of the tutorials shows that in a high percentage the same questions are repeated by different students.

According to Eurostat in 2017, an average of 10.6% of young people (aged 18-24) in the EU-28 were early leavers from education and training. Over 3 million young people in the European Union had been to university or college but had discontinued their studies at some point in their life, according to a survey of 2016. Therefore, the dropout level could potentially represent one of the major issues to be faced in a near future in the European Union. The main aim of the research is to predict, as early as possible, which kind of student will more easily dropout from the Higher Education (HE). This information would allow one to effectively carry out targeted actions in order to limit the incidence of the phenomenon. Today, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being employed to replace human activities that are repetitive, e.g. in the autonomous driving field or for the image classification task. In these areas AI competes with man with quite satisfactory results and, in the case of HE dropout, it is extremely unlikely that an expert teacher will be able to predict the student's educational success based only on the data provided by administrative offices. The recent breakthrough on Neural Networks with the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures has become disruptive in AI. By stacking together tens or hundreds of convolutional neural layers, a deep network structure is obtained, which has been proved very effective in producing high accuracy models. In this study the administrative data of approximately 6,000 students enrolled from 2009 on in the Education Department at Rome Tre University were used to train the CNNs. Then, the trained network provides a probabilistic model that indicates, for each student, the probability of dropping out. We used several types of state-of-the-art CNNs, and their variants, in order to build the most accurate model for the dropout prediction. The accuracy of the obtained models ranged from 67.1% for the students at the beginning of the first year up to 88.7% for the students at the end of the second year of their academic career. With the use of more data, for example students' career data, we could develop more accurate dropout prediction models.;"[Mezzini, Mauro; Bonavolonta, Gianmarco; Agrusti, Francesco] Roma Tre Univ, Dept Educ, Rome, Italy";Mezzini, M (corresponding author), Roma Tre Univ, Dept Educ, Rome, Italy.;;;;;;;51;1;1;2;2;IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT;VALENICA;LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN;2340-1079;;978-84-09-08619-1;INTED PROC;;;2019;;;;;;;9155;9163;;10.21125/inted.2019.2274;;;9;"Education & Educational Research; Psychology, Educational";"Education & Educational Research; Psychology";BP1XC;WOS:000541042204033;;;;;2020-12-16;

However, the limited GPU memory capacity limits the upper bound on the size of networks that can be offloaded to and trained using GPUs. vDNN addresses the GPU memory bottleneck issue and provides a solution which enables training of deep networks that are larger than GPU memory. In our work, we characterize and identify multiple bottlenecks with vDNN like delayed computation start, high pinned memory requirements and GPU memory fragmentation. We present vDNN++ which extends vDNN and resolves the identified issues. Our results show that the performance of vDNN++ is comparable or better (up to 60% relative improvement) than vDNN. We propose different heuristics and order for memory allocation, and empirically evaluate the extent of memory fragmentation with them.

Currently, the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud technologies are used in the course of projects such as the Horizon 2020 EU-Korea DECENTER project in order to implement four smart applications in the domains of Smart Homes, Smart Cities, Smart Construction and Robot Logistics. In these smart applications the Big Data pipeline starts from various sensor and video streams to which AI and feature extraction methods are applied. The resulting information is stored in database containers, which have to be placed on Edge, Fog or Cloud infrastructures. The placement decision depends on complex application requirements, including Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Information that must be considered when making placement decisions includes the expected workload, the list of candidate infrastructures, geolocation, connectivity and similar. Software engineers currently perform such decisions manually, which usually leads to QoS threshold violations. This paper aims to automate the process of making such decisions. Therefore, the goals of this paper are to: (1) develop a decision making method for database container placement; (2) formally verify each placement decision and provide probability assurances to the software engineer for high QoS; and (3) design and implement a new architecture that automates the whole process. A new optimisation method is introduced, which is based on the theory and practice of stochastic Markov Decision Processes (MDP). It uses as input monitoring data from the container runtime, the expected workload and user-related metrics in order to automatically construct a probabilistic finite automaton. The generated automaton is used for both automated decision making and placement success verification. The method is implemented in Java. It also uses the PRISM model-checking tool. Kubernetes is used in order to automate the whole process when orchestrating database containers across Edge, Fog and Cloud infrastructures. Experiments are performed for NoSQL Cassandra database containers for three representative workloads of 50000 (workload 1), 200000 (workload 2) and 500000 (workload 3) CRUD database operations. Five computing infrastructures serve as candidates for database container placement. The new MDP-based method is compared with the widely used Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The obtained results are used to analyse container placement decisions. When using the new MDP based method there were no QoS violations in any of the placement cases, while when using the AHP based method the placement results in some QoS threshold violations in all workload cases. Due to its properties, the new MDP method is particularly suitable for implementation. The paper also describes a multi-tier distributed computing system that uses multi-level (infrastructure, container, application) monitoring metrics and Kubernetes in order to orchestrate database containers across Edge, Fog and Cloud nodes.

These normative data may be helpful in guiding sound identification in future artificial intelligence studies and help clarify the relationships between sound naming and other variables, including hazard identification.;"[Li, Qingqing; Yu, Yiyang; Wang, Wu] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Okayama 7008530, Japan; [Qiong, Wu; Yang, Jiajia; Wu, Fengxia; Takahashi, Satoshi; Ejima, Yoshimichi; Wu, Jinglong] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Interdisciplinary Sci & Engn Hlth Syst, Okayama 7008530, Japan";Qiong, W (corresponding author), Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Interdisciplinary Sci & Engn Hlth Syst, Okayama 7008530, Japan.;"prbe3ggg@s.okayama-u.ac.jp; wu@mech.okayama-u.ac.jp";;"Yang, Jiajia/0000-0001-7521-9814; Wu, Qiong/0000-0002-9046-3556";"JAPAN SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCIENCE (JSPS) KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16K18052, 17K18855, 18H05009, 18K12149, 18H01411]; Okayama University";This research was supported by JAPAN SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCIENCE (JSPS) KAKENHI grant numbers 16K18052, 17K18855, 18H05009, 18K12149, and 18H01411, a Grant-in-Aid for Strategic Research Promotion from Okayama University.

Methods: A total of 108 lesions from patients with bladder cancer confirmed by postoperative pathology were analyzed retrospectively, including 60 cases of high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUG) and 48 cases of low-grade urothelial carcinoma (LGUC). All patients underwent routine MRI examination with the same scanning parameters. Lesions on T2-weighted image were delineated on ITK-Snap software by two radiologists to extract the corresponding volumes of interest(VOI). A.K. (Artificial Intelligence Kit) software was used for texture extraction, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to select image features with a method of 10 fold cross-validation, and to reduce the dimensionality. The spearman method was used afterwards to condense the image features by removing redundant. Logistic multiple regression correlation analysis was carried out, and the diagnostic efficiency of the characteristic parameters was analyzed by using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Result: 7 optimal features between HGUC group and LGUC group were screened, includeing two histogram features (Quantile0.025, skewness) and five GLCM features (GLCMEntropy_angle45_offset7, GLCMEntropy_angle0_offset7, ShortRunEmphasis-angle45_offset4, LongRunEmphasis_angle0_offset7, LongRunEmphasis_angle45_offset7), the AUC of the training group was 0.955, and the AUC of the testing group was 0. 894, both of which at good diagnostic decision point. Conclusion: Textural features from T2-weighted image can reflect the difference between low- and high-grade bladder cancer effectively.;"[Zhou, Zhe; Liu, Lin; Xue, Kaiming; Ma, Yue; Liu, Jiayan; Zhang, Mengchao] Jilin Univ, Dept Radiol, China Japan Union Hosp, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China";Zhang, MC (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Dept Radiol, China Japan Union Hosp, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.;"501302573@qq.com; zhangmengchao@jlu.edu.cn";;;;;;17;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-1697-6;;;;2019;;;;;;;1333;1337;;;;;5;"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics";"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering; Robotics";BP1FS;WOS:000539085600233;;;;;2020-12-16;

From simple implementations of the instructions to the emotional interaction, a big step into the era of artificial intelligence has been made in the technology of interaction. The trend of HCI must be from mechanized computer instructions to natural language. Since more than half of the information in human's communication is contained in non-verbal factors, facial expression recognition becomes an indispensable part. In this paper, convolution neural network is used to learn the facial expression. We used two different data sets, one large but with low resolution, the other small but with high resolution. By means of the local directional number mode operator, preliminary features are extracted from the latter. For data set with low resolution, we only perform denoising and normalization to maintain the few residual features. Then a self-built data set is used to test these two models, and their generalization performance is compared by confusion matrix. Also a detailed discussion of the recognition accuracy of different expressions is given by comparison and analysis. Finally we got the accuracy of 59% and 65% respectively, and came to the conclusion that the expression Happy and Surprise own the most recognizable features, while the others are somehow similar to each other so special enhancement or classification method that focuses on the similarity should be carried out in the future.;"[Zeng, Yuwen; Xiao, Nan; Wang, Kaidi; Yuan, Hang] Beijing Inst Technol, Key Lab Convergence Biomed Engn Syst & Healthcare, Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Sch Life Sci, 5 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China";Xiao, N (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Key Lab Convergence Biomed Engn Syst & Healthcare, Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Sch Life Sci, 5 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;xiaonan@bit.edu.cn;;;National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB134401];This research is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No.2017YFB134401).;;22;0;0;0;0;IEEE;NEW YORK;345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA;;;978-1-7281-1697-6;;;;2019;;;;;;;1536;1541;;;;;6;"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics";"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering; Robotics";BP1FS;WOS:000539085600269;;;;;2020-12-16;

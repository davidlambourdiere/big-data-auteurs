Internet provides millions of web pages for each and every search term. The Internet is a powerful medium for communication between computers and accessing online documents but it is not a tool for locating or organizing information. Tools like search engines assist users in locating information. The amount of daily searches on the web is broad and the task of getting interesting and required results quickly becomes very difficult. The use of an automatic web page classifier can simplify the process by assisting the search engine in getting relevant results. The web pages can present different and varied information depending on the characteristics of its content. The uncontrolled nature of web content presents additional challenges to web page classification as compared to traditional text classification, but the interconnected nature of hypertext also provides features that can assist the process. This paper analyses the feasibility of an automatic web page classifier, proposes several classifiers and studies their precision. In this sense, Data Mining techniques are of great importance and will be used to construct the classifiers.;;;;;Miro-Julia, Margaret/0000-0002-9300-8698;;;;;;;;;;;;1867-5662;;978-3-642-19916-5;;;;2011;89;;;;;;61;68;;;;;;;;;WOS:000291368100008;;;;;;

The ability and efficiency of vision system to capture and process the images is very important for any intelligent system such as autonomous robot. This paper gives attention to the development of a vision system that could contribute to the development of an automated vision based lawn mower robot.

For example, swarm intelligence in the form of ant colony optimization (ACO), has been repeatedly considered for the routing of data/information among nodes, a network-layer function, while genetic algorithms (GAs) have been used to select transmission frequencies and power levels, physical-layer functions. Similarly, artificial immune systems (AISs) as well as trust models of quantized data reputation have been invoked for detection of network intrusions that cause anomalies in data and information; these act on the application and presentation layers. Most recently, a self-organizing scheduling scheme inspired by frog-calling behavior for reliable data transmission in wireless sensor networks, termed anti-phase synchronization, has been applied to realize collision-free transmissions between neighboring nodes, a function of the MAC layer. In a novel departure from previous work, the cross-layer approach to WSN protocol design suggests applying more than one evolutionary computational method to the functions of the appropriate layers to improve the QoS performance of the cross-layer design beyond that of one method applied to a single layer's functions. A baseline WSN protocol design, embedding GAs, anti-phase synchronization, ACO, and a trust model based on quantized data reputation at the physical, MAC, network, and application layers, respectively, is constructed. Simulation results demonstrate the synergies among the bio-inspired/evolutionary methods of the proposed baseline design improve the overall QoS performance of networks over that of a single computational method.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0277-786X;1996-756X;978-0-81948-633-2;;;;2011;8059;;;;;;;;80590Q;10.1117/12.884818;;;;;;;WOS:000292763600018;;;;;;

This harvester can be used as autonomous source of electrical energy for remote or wireless applications, which are placed in environment excited by ambient mechanical vibrations. The ambient energy of vibrations is usually on very low level but the harvester can be used as alternative source of energy for electronic devices with an expected low level of power consumption of several mW. The optimized design of the vibration energy harvester was based on previous development and the sensitivity of harvester design was improved for effective harvesting from mechanical vibrations in aeronautic applications. The vibration energy harvester is a mechatronic system which generates electrical energy from ambient vibrations due to precision tuning up generator parameters. The optimization study for maximization of harvested power or minimization of volume and weight are the main goals of our development. The optimization study of such complex device is complicated therefore artificial intelligence methods can be used for tuning up optimal harvester parameters.;;;;"Hadas, Zdenek/I-4299-2014; Singule, Vladislav/AAD-8109-2020";"Hadas, Zdenek/0000-0002-9097-1550; Singule, Vladislav/0000-0002-6677-5955";;;;;;;;;;;;0277-786X;1996-756X;978-0-81948-655-4;;;;2011;8066;;;;;;;;806611;10.1117/12.886383;;;;;;;WOS:000292764300035;;;;;;

Recreating this success in engineered systems requires soft actuator technologies with embedded sensing and intelligence. Dielectric Elastomer Actuator(s) (DEA) are promising due to their large stresses and strains, as well as quiet flexible multimodal operation. Recently dielectric elastomer devices were presented with built in sensor, driver, and logic capability enabled by a new concept called the Dielectric Elastomer Switch(es) (DES). DES use electrode piezoresistivity to control the charge on DEA and enable the distribution of intelligence throughout a DEA device. In this paper we advance the capabilities of DES further to form volatile memory elements. A set reset flip-flop with inverted reset line was developed based on DES and DEA. With a 3200V supply the flip-flop behaved appropriately and demonstrated the creation of dielectric elastomer memory capable of changing state in response to 1 second long set and reset pulses. This memory opens up applications such as oscillator, de-bounce, timing, and sequential logic circuits; all of which could be distributed throughout biomimetic actuator arrays. Future work will include miniaturisation to improve response speed, implementation into more complex circuits, and investigation of longer lasting and more sensitive switching materials.";;;;;"Xie, Shane (Sheng Q.)/0000-0003-2641-2620; Calius, Emilio/0000-0001-6221-2779";;;;;;;;;;;;0277-786X;1996-756X;978-0-89418-538-0;;;;2011;7976;;;;;;;;797621;10.1117/12.880718;;;;;;;WOS:000294254200060;;;;;;

Output from an optical fiber exhibits a speckle pattern when projected on a flat surface, and intensity, size, and location of these speckles do change with external effects like pressure, temperature, vibration, etc. Statistical mode sensors reported in the literature use global image differencing or global correlation like approaches for sensor design. Namely, lots of localized information in the image is not taken into account, instead global difference and/or correlation are used for sensor construction. We propose the use of localized information with image processing techniques; generate more features, and analysis of these via artificial intelligence based methods.

Little use has been made of dynamic measurement, that are appropriate for more problems and situations. In particular, traditional Laser Scanner must Keep stable to scan and measure coordinate transformation parameters between different station. In order to make the scanning measurement intelligently and rapidly, in this paper, we developed a new registration algorithm for handleheld laser scanner based on the positon of target, which realize the dynamic measurement of handheld laser scanner without any more complex work. the double camera on laser scanner can take photograph of the artificial target points to get the three-dimensional coordinates, this points is designed by random coding. And then, a set of matched points is found from control points to realize the orientation of scanner by the least-square common points transformation. After that the double camera can directly measure the laser point cloud in the surface of object and get the point cloud data in an unified coordinate system. There are three major contributions in the paper. Firstly, a laser scanner based on binocular vision is designed with double camera and one laser head. By those, the real-time orientation of laser scanner is realized and the efficiency is improved. Secondly, the coding marker is introduced to solve the data matching, a random coding method is proposed. Compared with other coding methods, the marker with this method is simple to match and can avoid the shading for the object. Finally, a recognition method of coding maker is proposed, with the use of the distance recognition, it is more efficient. The method present here can be used widely in any measurement from small to huge obiect, such as vehicle, airplane which strengthen its intelligence and efficiency. The results of experiments and theory analzing demonstrate that proposed method could realize the dynamic measurement of handheld laser scanner. Theory analysis and experiment shows the method is reasonable and efficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0277-786X;;978-0-81948-833-6;;;;2011;8192;;1;;;;;;81921X;10.1117/12.900262;;;;;;;WOS:000295055800068;;;;;;

A practical application often requires only all approximate value of the total number of assignments that satisfy all given Boolean constraints. There is a known trichotomy theorem for such approximate counting for (non-weighted) Boolean CSPs; namely, all such counting problems are neatly classified into three categories under polynomial-time approximation-preserving reductions. We extend this result to approximate counting for complex-weighted Boolean CSPs, provided that all unary constraints are freely available to use. This marks a significant progress in the quest for the approximation classification of all counting Boolean CSPs.

Satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solvers are the state-of-the-art techniques for handling this problem. A major bottleneck is, however, the handling of quantified formulas. Our contribution is a model generation technique for quantified formulas that is powered by a verification technique. The model generation technique can be used either stand-alone for model generation, or as a precomputation step for SMT solvers to eliminate quantifiers. Quantifier elimination in this sense is sound for showing satisfiability but not for refutational or validity proofs.

A multiagent-based IDS (ABIDS) inspired by the danger theory of human immune system is proposed. The intelligence behind ABIDS is based on the functionality of dendritic cells in human immune systems and the danger theory, while dentritic cells agents (DC agent) are emulated for innate immune subsystem and artificial T-cell agents (TC agent) are for adaptive immune subsystem. Antigens are profiles of system calls while corresponding behaviors are regarded as signals. This ABIDS is based on the dual detections of DC agent for signals and TC agent for antigen, where each agent coordinates with other to calculate danger value (DV). ABAIS is an intelligent system with learning and memory capabilities. According to DVs, immune response for malicious behaviors is activated by either computer host or Security Operating Center (SOC). Multiple agents are embedded to ABIDS, where agents coordinate one another to calculate mature context antigen value (MCAV) and update activation threshold for security responses. Accordingly, computer hosts met with malicious intrusions can be effectively detected via input signals and temporary output signals such as PAMP, danger and safe signals.;;;;Ou, Chung-Ming/A-1019-2014;;;;;;;;;;;;;1098-7584;;978-1-4244-7317-5;;;;2011;;;;;;;115;122;;;;;;;;;WOS:000295224300013;;;;;;

The fuzzy professional-social-sexual pain assessment is able to represent the inherent physiological, psychological characteristics by taking into account the emotional, complex perceptual, subjective, and personal phenomenon involving all domains of an individual meanwhile can deal with cultural mechanisms within individual life experience. According to the proposed approach, not only fuzzy set theory but fuzzy systems can also direct and immediately improve medicine and healthcare in general, and pain assessment, in particular, in a subjective and multi-dimensional model.;;;;Araujo, Ernesto/B-8111-2012;Araujo, Ernesto/0000-0002-4305-9120;;;;;;;;;;;;1098-7584;;978-1-4244-7317-5;;;;2011;;;;;;;1634;1639;;;;;;;;;WOS:000295224300246;;;;;;

Different from the previous approach where reversibility, skin infection, and skin changes were the input variables, this new fuzzy lymphedema clinical assessment takes into account the elements that compose the Brazilian Society of Lymphology (SBL). Such a SBL-based metric not only takes into account pre-clinical cases with risk of worsening and infective-degenerative local complications but also points out functional data of limb edema with the involvement of articular joints. The proposed approach includes both clinical (Pitting, Skin Changes, Stemmer Signal and Reversibility) and functional criteria (Joint Involvement). The fuzzy lymphedema assessment based on clinical and functional criteria allows establishing therapeutic global rehabilitative programs, degree of assistance necessity of patients, and reduction of the daily living activities.;;;;Araujo, Ernesto/B-8111-2012;Araujo, Ernesto/0000-0002-4305-9120;;;;;;;;;;;;1098-7584;;978-1-4244-7317-5;;;;2011;;;;;;;2708;2713;;;;;;;;;WOS:000295224300405;;;;;;

But the method requires analyzing the object in numerous small sections to detect the damage. Non-invasive diagnosis methods for fault detection are used in different industrial sectors. In this work, the main focus is on global fault detection for structural mechanical components such as a bonded beam using artificial intelligence, i.e., neural nets. Therefore, the fault detection procedure requires only a global measurement in the structural component in operational conditions. An experimental setup using two aluminum beams bonded with an adhesive was used to simulate a bonded joint. Different sizes of adhesive surface simulate faults in the original adhesive joint. Thereafter, resonance frequency shifts in the Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) were used to detect structural faults. Damage in structures causes small changes in the structural resonances. Then, the FRFs were used as an input into an artificial supervised neural network. This work considers global non-destructive tests focused only on the soundness estimation of the system. The neural network involved is a supervised feed-forward network with Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm, which classifies the beams in four clusters. The classification consists in beam damaged or not damaged. If the beam is damaged the intensity of the fault is established.

Moreover, in a future power system mostly consisting of distributed generators and renewable energy resources on which the disturbance has more impact, the analysis of disturbances by classifying and categorizing real-time frequency data is rather critical. Fortunately, wide area frequency data from a nation-wide frequency monitoring network (FNET) provides a means by which disturbances can be detected. However, so far none of strategies reported to date has good performance at classifying the disturbances although many of them are used currently in on-line analysis. The complex and irregular pattern characteristics of each kind of disturbance are the main reason. Artificial intelligence methods could be one of the solutions, but the large number of input values and an insufficient number of training examples has slowed the reduction of artificial intelligence methods to practice. Therefore, a mathematical model of common disturbances is proposed to generate a training database for artificial intelligence method and feature extraction by computing the wavelet coefficients, parameterizing the results and computer generating the data. This paper uses a multi-class support vector machine model to be trained on the extracted features to discern the otherwise hard-to-classify disturbances pattern and upon testing, yields good performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1558-058X;;978-1-61284-738-2;;;;2011;;;;;;;68;72;;;;;;;;;WOS:000295256200015;;;;;;

This paper proposes algorithm referred to the extended height value algorithm which is developed to an advanced level, so that the artificial robot could be made capable of exploring unknown regions such as micro-mouse competition maze. All of the 256 units in the standard 16*16 units maze are given a series of numbers, which represent discretely assigned potential levels of turning into the crossway during exploring task. The numbers will be taken into consideration when the robot makes the crossway choice as well as autonomous route decisions. Then the choices will alter when the micro-mouse walks in order to optimize the exploring process. The paper also demonstrates effective measures to avoid duplication exploring as much as possible with artificial intelligence technique. In order to verify the developed algorithm, a simple, yet effective simulation program is coded to show that the improved algorithm has higher average efficiency compared with the less intelligent traditional algorithms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2156-2318;;978-1-4244-8755-4;;;;2011;;;;;;;370;375;;;;;;;;;WOS:000296062500072;;;;;;

Simulator X is targeted at Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, and computer games. It provides a foundation and testbed for a variety of different application models. The current research architecture is based on the actor model to support fine grained concurrency and parallelism. Its design follows the minimize coupling and maximize cohesion software engineering principle. A distributed world state and execution scheme is combined with an object-centered world view based on an entity model. Entities conceptually aggregate properties internally represented by state variables. An asynchronous event mechanism allows intra-and interprocess communication between the simulation actors. An extensible world interface uses an ontology-based semantic annotation layer to provide a coherent world view of the resulting distributed world state and execution scheme to application developers. The world interface greatly simplifies configurability and the semantic layer provides a solid foundation for the integration of different Artificial Intelligence components. The current architecture is implemented in Scala using the Java virtual machine. This choice additionally fosters low-level scalability, portability, and reusability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1087-8270;;978-1-4577-0036-1;;;;2011;;;;;;;171;174;;;;;;;;;WOS:000297260400029;;;;;;

Recent results show that the simple nearest neighbor method with an appropriate distance measure performs surprisingly well, outperforming many state-of-the art methods. This suggests that the choice of distance measure is crucial for time series classification. In this paper we shortly review the most important distance measures of the literature, and, as major contribution, we propose a framework that allows fusion of these different similarity measures in a principled way. Within this framework, we develop a hybrid similarity measure.

It has also led to development over the last decade and a half of software tools for supporting the algorithm design process. The signals to be analyzed are the superposition of temporally localized and temporally overlapping signal components from broadly defined signal classes pertinent to the given application. Resolving a signal's complexity thus amounts to decoding it to reveal details of the specific signal components that are present at each point of a dense temporal grid defined on the signal. IPUS uses artificial intelligence techniques such as rule-based inference in conjunction with parameterized signal processing transformations to combat the combinatorial explosion encountered in any exhaustive search among the possible decoding answers for a given signal.

Traditional price-based AQM algorithms suffer from sluggish response, poor robustness, and lack adequate adaptability against dynamic traffics. To improve AQM performance, this paper introduces artificial intelligence methods to design a sophisticated AQM algorithm. In particular, a fuzzy neuron price is developed for congestion detection. Hebbian learning rule and fuzzy logic theory are employed to configure the control parameters automatically for better adaptability and robustness. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is stable, responsive and performs robustly against time-varying network dynamics. It is superior to other peer AQM algorithms in various performance indicators, such as stability and jitter of queue length as well as packet loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1930-529X;;978-1-4244-9268-8;;;;2011;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000300509005128;;;;;;

The POMDP allows the system to automatically modify exercise parameters to account for the specific needs and abilities of different individuals, and to use these parameters to take appropriate decisions about stroke rehabilitation exercises. The performance of the system was evaluated through various simulations and by comparing the decisions made by the system with those of a human therapist for a single patient.

Aiming at the characteristics of remote sensing image classification, the mixed pixel problem is one of the main factors that affect the improvement of classification precision in image. How to decompose the mixed pixels precisely and effectively for multispectral/hyper spectral remote sensing images is a critical issue for the quantitative research. As Remote sensing data is widely used for the classification of types of land cover such as vegetation, water body thus Conflicts are one of the most characteristic attributes in satellite multilayer imagery. Conflict occurs in tagging class label to mixed pixels that encompass spectral response of different land cover on the ground element. In this paper we attempted to present a new approach for resolving the mixed pixels using Biogeography based optimization. The paper deals with the idea of tagging the mixed pixel to a particular class by finding the best suitable class for it using the concept of immigration and emigration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2153-6996;;978-1-4577-1005-6;;;;2011;;;;;;;2801;2804;;10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049796;;;;;;;WOS:000297496302205;;;;;;

The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is an optimization algorithm based on the intelligent food foraging behavior of honey bees. The proposed variant, Artificial Bee Colony with Self-Adaptive Mutation (ABC-SAM) makes attempts to dynamically adapt the mutation step size with which the artificial bees explore the search space. Mutation with small step size produces small variations of existing solutions which is better for exploitations, while large mutation steps are likely to produce large variations that facilitate better explorations of the search space. ABC-SAM fosters both large and small mutation steps as well as adaptively controls the step lengths based on their effectiveness to produce better solutions. ABC-SAM has been evaluated and compared on a number of benchmark functions with the basic ABC algorithm, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Particle Swarm Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (PS-EA). Results indicate that the proposed adaptation scheme facilitates more effective mutations and performs better optimization outperforming all other algorithms in comparison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4577-0255-6;;;;2011;;;;;;;49;53;;;;;;;;;WOS:000299628600009;;;;;;

Learning how brain learns would be the milestone to guide the researchers of artificial intelligence, neurology and psychology. With the advent of Integrate and Fire model of neuron proposed about a hundred years ago, the brain research has picked up its pace in the study of different aspects of brain functionality. Many cognitive architectures have been proposed with an aim of simulating and understanding human cognition. On the other hand, many technologies have emerged that can measure the parameters of the brain activity. Among them, Electroencephalogram (EEG) stands as a reliable tool in the study of brain functioning. Simplified wireless EEGs are readily available now which can send data recorded by its electrodes to a computer for further processing. We have chosen this tool to detect different aspects of cognition and to predict the brain functioning behind it. A lot of studies from the past two decades have already revealed varying EEG patterns related to cognition. In this paper, we have proposed to extract different features from visual, tactile, auditory and psychomotor stimuli to work on different cognitive aspects such as memory, emotion, arousal, fatigue and distraction and to investigate its affect on the EEG. A methodology to model cognitive functions by relating the varying event related potential, brain waves, spectral density and latency in EEG outcomes are then related with the stimuli features to predict the cognitive state of mind.;;;;Nedic, Zorica/G-9691-2011;Nedic, Zorica/0000-0002-6970-1759;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4577-0255-6;;;;2011;;;;;;;1045;1049;;;;;;;;;WOS:000299628600200;;;;;;

In previous works, we have discussed how these could help coin and prompt future direction of their usage (integration) in various real-world scenarios such as in disaster management. This paper builds upon on our previous works and addresses the use of learning agents called learning birds in modelling the process of data collection using wireless sensor networks, Specifically, learning birds are some sort of nature-inspired learning agents collaborating to create collective behaviours. As an artificial bird flock, the swarm members collaborate in positioning while moving within a particular environment. In order to improve the diversity of the flock, each individual needs learning the how to position relatively to its neighbours. Q learning is a very famous reinforcement learning algorithm, which offers a very efficient and straightforward learning approach based-on gained experiences. Therefore, a swarm of birds collaborating and learning while exchanging information to position offers a very useful modelling approach to develop ad hoc based mobile data collection tools. To achieve this, we use a disaster management scenario.;;;;"Aydin, Mehmet/G-4331-2011; Xhafa, Fatos/S-3359-2019; Aydin, Mehmet/B-7237-2016; XHAFA, FATOS/B-8869-2012";"Aydin, Mehmet/0000-0002-4890-5648; Aydin, Mehmet/0000-0002-4890-5648; XHAFA, FATOS/0000-0001-6569-5497; Bessis, Nik/0000-0002-6013-3935";;;;;;;;;;;;1550-445X;;978-0-7695-4337-6;;;;2011;;;;;;;332;339;;10.1109/AINA.2011.75;;;;;;;WOS:000299083800044;;;;;;

Due to their distinct properties and advantages, they are currently being investigated and integrated to form new models or strategies in the areas of system control. This paper presents an adjustment strategy for a dynamic tracking neuro-fuzzy controller (DTNC) for steady-state control in complex system. In this method, DTNC consists of two neural network composed of the same structure, one for control, one for learning. Strategies to adjust the DTNC in accordance with the environment dynamics are automatically generated in off-line manner in learning neural network. The generated strategies are stored in a neural network and with the changes of the external environment parameters, the learning part used for adjusting the DTNC in on-line. The other neural network has to be regarded as controller, and now tuned into a learning part. Therefore, the DTNC is automatically adjusted in accordance with the dynamics of complex environment using the generated strategies which are stored in two neural networks.

Unfortunately, the cost of the required hardware is prohibitively expensive for many departments for what is typically a once-a-semester demonstration. So we decided to port the algorithm to a platform that many departments may already have on hand: the LEGO Mindstorms RCX 2.0. Initially the task seemed relatively straightforward: build a robot base out of LEGO parts and implement the algorithm in the Not Quite C language. However the challenges of designing a robot arm without servos and attempting to trim code down to a size that would fit on the RCX has proven to be as educational to the undergraduates working on the project as we hope the final product will be to students in AI classes.

This is especially important when performing Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions with an Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) where a pilot may be thousands of miles removed from the platform. A very attractive radio link to a mobile ISR platform is provided by UHF SATCOM, which requires only modest gain antennas. However, the small physical payload size and weight requirements of new and evolving ISR platforms present a significant challenge to the antenna designer where efficiency and bandwidth must be traded with antenna size. JEM Engineering has developed a new UHF SATCOM antenna design that utilizes advances in realizing magneto-dielectric (MD) substrates for a spiral radiator. Considering the gain-versus-frequency curve for spiral antennas, JEM's advanced MD substrate reduces the size of the spiral needed to achieve a useful low frequency knee. An Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) is also used in the spiral cavity to recover energy that traditionally is lost by absorption in conventional spiral cavities. This paper presents the results of a prototype UHF SATCOM antenna, shown in Figure 1 at right, measuring just 14 x 14 x 2.5 that is suitable for airborne use. The antenna operates over the 240 - 320 MHz band, weighs less than 5 pounds, may be flush mounted to a platform's outer mold line, and provides hemispherical coverage with efficiencies greater than 50%.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4673-0081-0;;;;2011;;;;;;;1808;1811;;;;;;;;;WOS:000300083500302;;;;;;

FL is chosen because it is widely used to predict the machining performances such as surface roughness, cutting force and material removal rate. Previous works on FL focusing on fuzzy components has been presented. The FL components are fuzzification, fuzzy rule, inference engine and defuzzification. The review shows that the FL components for fuzzification, which is logical operator, membership function (MF) and IF-THEN rule, is the necessary facts that must be considered before applying FL in prediction. Fuzzy rule that is derived from fuzzification process is important in the development of inference engine. Therefore, the defuzzification of the inference engine will give desired fuzzy system. The review also revealed that there are several types of defuzzification which include centroid, bisector, smallest of maximum, mean of maximum and largest of maximum. There are important facts that must be considered in FL development. To conclude, this paper revealed that MF and defuzzification is important in predicting machining performance. It shows that for MF and defuzzification, triangular and centroid are respectively mostly used in the prediction process. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It cannot be an analytical science such as physics or psychology yet it rather has to be a science of design such as aeronautics or artificial intelligence. A design science of education must determine how the different models and learning environments contribute to learning, cooperation, motivation, etc. The evolution of information technology offers both advantages and disadvantages and the latter mainly refers to the multitude of possible breaches in any area that appeals to cybernetic systems. In the fight against such crimes on e-learning platforms and not only, there is required a well-established legal framework in terms of prevention, detection and punishment of those facts. Law 161/2003 represents a starting point, but to keep up with the huge diversity of crime taking place with using a simple keyboard and a click of the mouse, the legislative work should not stop here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2066-026X;;;;;;2011;;;;;;;534;539;;;;;;;;;WOS:000299797400082;;;;;;

The task of analyzing a corpus of academic articles was resolved with hybrid probabilistic neural networks and developed word clusters. The created prototypes of word clusters provide the probabilistic neural networks with possibilities of recognizing corpus clusters. The established corpus comprises 1376 articles, from specialist leading SCI-indexed journals, and provides representative samples of the language of science and technology. In this paper, a review of selected issues is carried out with regards to computational approaches to language modelling as well as semantic patterns of language. The paper features semantic-based recognition algorithms of word clusters of similar meanings but different lexico-grammatical patterns from the established corpus using rnultilayer neural networks. The paper also presents experimental results of word cluster semantic-based recognition in the context of phrase meaning analysis.;;;;Majewski, Maciej/H-9489-2014;Majewski, Maciej/0000-0003-1428-7244;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;978-3-642-21104-1;;;;2011;6675;;;;;;83;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000301802600011;;;;;;

Particularly, it has created a new perspective of decoupling and linearization. With reference to the non-linearization and strong coupling of multi variable permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), this paper presents internal model control (IMC) of PMSM using RBF neural network inverse (RBF-NNI) system. In the proposed control scheme, the RBF-NNI system is introduced to construct a pseudo-linear system with original system, and internal model controller is utilized as a robust controller. Therefore, the new system has advantages of above two methods. The efficiency of the proposed control scheme is evaluated through computer simulation results. By using the proposed control scheme, original system is successfully decoupled. and expresses strong robustness to load torque disturbance. the whole system provides good static and dynamic performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-21110-2;;;;2011;6677;;;;;;68;76;;;;;;;;;WOS:000301947300008;;;;;;

In addition, we consider a strength of cause and effect to analyze complex condition and situation.

The game users have been extremely improved their playing level, but the AT (artificial intelligence) system of the game was rarely updated. At the consequence, current AI level is much poorer than that of the human players. In this paper, we present a noble AI mechanism for StarCraft based on the adaptive strategy decision mechanism.

In the last years there have appeared many new evolutionary algorithms based on the collective intelligence. Finding TFBS is crucial for understanding the gene regulatory relationship but, motifs are weakly conserved, and motif discovery is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, the use of such algorithms can be a good way to obtain quality results. The chosen algorithm is the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), it is an optimization algorithm based on the intelligent foraging behaviour of honey bee swarm. To solve the MDP we have applied multiobjective optimization and consequently, we have adapted the ABC to multiobjective problems, defining the Multiobjective Artificial Bee Colony (MOABC) algorithm.

Modular, hybrid solutions tend to be built from components mostly created by the same programmer or the same team. What if we already have many solutions online - programs created by a number of different authors and hosted as services - and wish to compose them into a larger, distributed hybrid program which performs better than the individual components? Can this be done automatically? The World-Wide Mind (W2M) project attempts to scale up artificial intelligence by distributing action-selecting agents (which we call minds) and problem environments (which we call worlds) as services on the internet, and by allowing minds to call other minds and thus facilitate building hybrid minds from many programs which may have been written by many authors.

After the spectrum sensing and decision processes, detected or predicted spectrum holes need to be utilized by the CR users conforming to specific principles. Many approaches are applied in this field, like rule based or artificial intelligence inspired solutions, game theoretic scenarios, scheduling and auctioning. In this paper, we propose a distributed spectrum sharing mechanism that is based on individual spectrum decisions, priority and messaging mechanism between CR users. Here, all users sense and decide the channel occupancy by themselves. Cooperation is acquired by a messaging framework that enables each user to retrieve its neighbors' channel decisions and priorities to use a channel from the common control channel (CCC). In our scheme, we model a messaging topology that represents the deficiencies in CCC. On the other hand, interference graph is chosen to be fully connected. We simulated our network model and spectrum sharing system using MATLAB Simulink environment and extracted the following performance metrics: Traffic Request Satisfaction Rate (TRSR), Channel Occupancy Rate ( COR) and Fairness among CR users. The obtained results are compared with other techniques employing rule based channel selection strategies as selfish and random channel selection.;;;;Oktug, Sema F./M-6323-2015;Oktug, Sema F./0000-0002-0532-2733;;;;;;;;;;;;2376-6492;;978-1-4244-9537-5;;;;2011;;;;;;;477;482;;;;;;;;;WOS:000300570200082;;;;;;

This algorithm enables evolutionary-estimated per-partes-programming the Turing machine for solving complex tasks and offers flexible way of setting parameters for the programming process. The parameter setting is a key feature of designed algorithm. Parameters of the algorithm have the form of weights which influence the rate of deterministic/stochastic behavior of the algorithm. By changing the weights there can be achieved entirely different results for solving the same problem.

Maximum air temperature is one of the most important parameters to be estimated for meteorology, because the maximum and minimum temperature data is the outlook of the institution and the most interesting aspect of weather forecast presentations. Many meteorological variables play an important role in estimating the lowest and highest temperature of the day. Today, numerical models are mainly used in weather forecasting. The incredible success of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in classification and estimation makes it necessary to use this approach in the area of meteorology. Apart from known methods, ANN, which is an artificial intelligence technique, was used to forecast maximum temperature, which is the modeling of a non-linear process. In this study, the data for the years 2008 and 2009 was used that were obtained from the Turkish Meteorological Data Archive System and The Directorate of Konya Airfield Meteorology Station, which are the institutions of the General Directorate of Turkish State Meteorological Services. The developed ANN has 6 inputs and 1 output. The six input variables were respectively the temperature at 850 hpa level (t(850)-degrees C), daily average actual pressure (P-mb), daily minimum temperature (t(min)-degrees C), daily mean temperature (t(mean)-degrees C), daily average relative humidity (H-%) and daily sunshine duration (SD-hour). The output parameter value was the daily maximum temperature (t(max)-degrees C). Feed-forward back-propagation ANN model was used in this study. Levenberg-Marquardt (trainlm) training algorithm and Hyperbolic Tangent Sigmoid (tansig) and Logarithmic Sigmoid (logsig) transfer function were tried in the software developed in MATLAB and the results were obtained. The study put forth that accuracy rates and mean absolute error (MSE) obtained from training and test operations can be used in determining the maximum air temperature in the generated model.;;;;CINAR, Ahmet Cevahir/M-1353-2019;CINAR, Ahmet Cevahir/0000-0001-5596-6767;;;;;;;;;;;;1803-3814;;978-80-214-4302-0;;;;2011;;;;;;;236;243;;;;;;;;;WOS:000302647900038;;;;;;

The process of data mining is based on tabulated or otherwise, arranged usually blind dates. It ends by finding of knowledge (patterns) contained in these data, expressed in a simpler and clearer form than the original data. Monitoring and control systems collect for control and evaluation purposes a number of operational data, which are usually archived, for operator systems construct their databases as easily as possible, each trend is usually stored in a separate table. Data in tables are stored in two basic principles, either periodically after a preset time interval or after a certain event. In terms of subsequent offline data processing it would be advantageous to impose a set of related data to the same table. Then a change of each stored variables impose storage of the entire record, including data that has not changed its value. As a solution of previous problems saving each monitored variable in a separate table could be, but this solution complicates establishing the overall information from the data in different tables. The article focuses on some procedures for automated data processing technology.

However, almost all conventional routing protocols for MANETs suffer from their lack of adaptivity leading to their performance degradation under varying network conditions. In fact, this is due to both simplistic conception hypotheses they made about the network and to the use of some prefixed parameters in protocols implementations. Currently, artificial intelligence methods like Reinforcement Learning (RL) are widely used to design adaptive routing strategies for MANETs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of RL-based routing protocols for MANETs. Besides, we propose some future research directions in this area.;;;;CHIKHI, Salim/E-1550-2017;CHIKHI, Salim/0000-0002-8369-8533;;;;;;;;;;;;1865-0929;1865-0937;978-3-642-21936-8;;;;2011;162;;;;;;1;13;;;;;;;;;WOS:000302750400001;;;;;;

Artificial intelligence has been reported to give revolutionary outcomes in the field of control engineering. The capability of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to map any nonlinear function satisfactorily based on input-output data has been widely established in intelligent control.

Several recent articles have demonstrated the application of pattern analysis techniques to the discovery of non-trivial relations in various datasets that have relevance for social and human sciences, and some have even heralded the advent of Computational Social Sciences and Culturomics. In this review article I survey the results obtained over the past 5 years at the Intelligent Systems Laboratory in Bristol, in the area of automating the analysis of news media content. This endeavor, which we approach by combining pattern recognition, data mining and language technologies, is traditionally a part of the social sciences, and is normally performed by human researchers on small sets of data. The analysis of news content is of crucial importance due to the central role that the global news system plays in shaping public opinion, markets and culture. It is today possible to access freely online a large part of global news, and to devise automated methods for large scale constant monitoring of patterns in content. The results presented in this survey show how the automatic analysis of millions of documents in dozens of different languages can detect non-trivial macro-patterns that could not be observed at a smaller scale, and how the social sciences can benefit from closer interaction with the pattern analysis, artificial intelligence and text mining research communities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-21458-5;;;;2011;6661;;;;;;2;13;;;;;;;;;WOS:000303340900002;;;;;;

The evaluation method is a core in urban land use suitability evaluation. Traditional urban land use suitability evaluation methods are GIS-based methods which often can not get satisfactory results for the complex nonlinear urban land use system. Artificial neural network is a frontier theory of complex non-linearity scientific and artificial intelligence science. It is a new method to evaluate urban land use suitability. This paper took the land use suitability evaluation of Hefei city as an example, building a back propagation neural network with 8 neurous of input layer, 5 neurons of hide layer and 3 neurons of output layer. The analysis shows: the high suitability area is 682.27 km(2) in Hefei city, being about 8.73% of the total study area; the middle suitability area is 5965.76 km(2), or about 76.33% of the total area and the low suitability area is 1167.35 km(2), or about 14.94% of the total area. The results reflect the actual situation in Hefei city. The study shows that the back propagation neural network model can overcome the shortcomings of traditional evaluation methods. It means that artificial neural network is suitable for urban land use suitability evaluation. This reflects that artificial neural network has great academic value and application prospect in urban land use suitability evaluation.

Gene expression programming used in the paper is an example of collective adaptive system, but we propose to use a collective intelligence to develop not only one forecasting model, but a set of models, from which the most suitable one can be chosen automatically or manually by the decision-maker.;;;;;Duda, Jerzy/0000-0002-9225-7123;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;"978-3-642-23937-3; 978-3-642-23938-0";;;;2011;6923;;;;;;445;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000304027900045;;;;;;

Route planning attempts to enhance safety by minimizing the exposure of the aircraft to the threat air defense systems while achieving the mission objectives. Based on Voronoi diagram theory, a flight route optimization method is introduced to insure the armed helicopter to penetrate the emery's radar defense system at the lowest danger. The factors, such as radar cross section and distance between helicopter and radar, that affect the radar detection are firstly analyzed. Then Voronoi diagram and its application for route planning to minimize the detection probability of an armed helicopter are described introduced in details. Dijkstra algorithm is employed to solve the optimization problem and to obtain the initial flight path. The simulation of artificial potential field dynamic is performed to transform the initial path to the smooth flight route. Example analysis of a hypothesis armed helicopter shows that the developed method is helpful for the on-the-spot planning that combines aircraft flight performance and intelligence information regarding the estimated enemy weapon locations to develop routes that avoid or mask the enemy sensor and weapon envelopes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1660-9336;;978-3-03785-099-2;;;;2011;55-57;;1-3;;;;1541;1546;;10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.55-57.1541;;;;;;;WOS:000303778601020;;;;;;

Wet chemical methods and handheld leaf Chl meters such as the Minolta SPAD-502 Chl meter(Markwell, 1995) have traditionally been used for this purpose. Recently, the availability of small and affordable radiometers, which uses Near infra-red and Red edge(CIred edge)(Mark R. Steel, 2008b), for Chl estimation in grapevine leaves, has provided means to estimate Chl from reflectance measurements. The two methods were equally accurate measuring pigments at low to moderate Chl levels. But, when Chl exceeded 300 mg/m(2), SPAD sensitivity to Chl declined noticeably and the accuracy of Chl estimation by the CIred edge was much higher than that of the SPAD meter, the chlorophyll index was found to be capable of accurately estimating pigment contents across a much greater Chl range than the SPAD meter. However, in this paper an artificial-intelligence technique, the Support Vector Machine (SVM(Light)V6.01) model was introduced to establish the relationship between the Chlorophylls content and reflectance of 400-750 nm spectrum, variation of species and growth stages, which can much more perfectly compensated the reflectance that was absorpted by anthocyanin and carotenoids and scatterd because of different leaf thickness, density, or surface properties. As a result that we have solved the problems such as saturation and/or asymptote in high/or lower content of chlorophyll, and SVM model was found to be capable of more accurately estimating pigment contents across a greater range than the SPAD and CIred edge, thus it can be used for quantitative assessment of early stages of pant stress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1022-6680;;978-3-03785-123-4;;;;2011;239-242;;1-4;;;;2376;2388;;10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR239-242.2376;;;;;;;WOS:000304284001145;;;;;;

Artificial Neural Networks have been proposed to improve the performance of physicians in clinical decision-making. In this study, a new computational intelligence technique for the prediction of persistent asthma in children is presented. The presented method is based on Multi-Layer Perceptron neural networks and Probabilistic Neural Networks architectures.

Within Software Engineering, the activities related to requirements become a suitable target for these techniques, since a good or bad execution of these tasks has a strong impact in the quality of the final software product. Hence, a tool to support the decision makers during these activities is highly desired. This work presents a three-layer architecture, which provides a seamless integration between Knowledge Engineering and Requirement Engineering. The architecture is instantiated into a CARE (Computer-Aided Engineering Requirement) tool that integrates some Artificial Intelligence techniques: Requisites, a Bayesian network used to validate the specification of the requirements of a project, and metaheuristic techniques (simulated annealing, genetic algorithm and an ant colony system) to the selection of the requirements that have to be included into the final software product.;;;;"del Aguila, Isabel M/A-9740-2015; del Sagrado, Jose/F-9504-2016";"del Aguila, Isabel M/0000-0001-9896-7196; del Sagrado, Jose/0000-0002-5616-056X";;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-25273-0;;;;2011;7023;;;;;;213;222;;;;;;;;;WOS:000305319500022;;;;;;

A common and simple form of filter to reduce the noise originated in signal processing, the finite impulse response (FIR) filter. There are several of these noise reduction methods used throughout the financial instrument trading community. The major issue with these filters is the delay between the filtered data and the noisy data. This delay only increases as more noise reduction is desired. In the present marketplace, where investors are competing for quality and timely information, this delay can be a hindrance. This paper proposes a new FIR filter derived with the aim of maximizing the level of noise reduction and minimizing the delay. The model is modified from the old problem of time series graduation by penalized least squares. Comparison between five different methods has been clone and experiment results have shown that our method is significantly superior to the alternatives in both delay and smoothness over short and middle range delay periods.;;;;Gao, Junbin/A-1766-2009;"Gao, Junbin/0000-0001-9803-0256; Zheng, Lihong/0000-0001-5728-4356";;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-25831-2;;;;2011;7106;;;;;;72;81;;;;;;;;;WOS:000305356500008;;;;;;

Driving forces for mechanization are identified. Dutch greenhouse crop production is used as an example. In greenhouse horticulture the production steps and control that needs to be done in the growing area of high value crops and flowers are still often done manually. Growers are investing a lot of labour in processes like crop sensing, crop maintenance and harvesting the products. To harvest these high value products, a lot of human intelligence is required, such as precise, effective and efficient eye-hand coordination in a complex environment, decisions concerning quality and ripeness and careful handling and buffering of variably shaped vulnerable products. Within the next years the first generation of machines will be introduced in greenhouse horticulture using principles of mechatronics and robotics, combining smart mechanical design with sensors and 'artificial intelligence' needed for these difficult tasks. Examples are the current commercial robot developments for cutting roses, harvesting strawberries and cucumber. But jumping from fully manual production to fully robotised production is a complex challenge and probably not always and not yet the way to go. As an intermediate step, also technology is needed to support current human labour for instance to harvest more precise, targeting on specific quality as a post-harvest feedback and to buffer the high value products carefully and automatically and it is even possible to support human labour by pointing out the ripe products that need to be harvested. Ambient intelligence is more and more becoming a part of the working environment. Here the idea is presented that new ICT developments in gaming can stimulate labour in greenhouse horticulture to do the work better and faster with a lot more fun when there is the challenge to reach new skills, features and levels supported in a gaming environment. Finally, progress in the field of greenhouse robotic and mechatronic systems does not only rely on innovations in the field of robot and mechatronic systems but also on necessary innovations in the field of growing systems and plant breeding to reduce variability and thus to simplify the task for men and machinery.;;;;"van Henten, Eldert J./K-8864-2019; Van Henten, Eldert/AAQ-3844-2020";;;;;;;;;;;;;0567-7572;2406-6168;978-90-66050-47-1;;;;2011;;893;;;;;85;94;;10.17660/ActaHortic.2011.893.4;;;;;;;WOS:000305385800004;;;;;;

A mobility system is sustainable if it ensures mobility and accessibility within, outside and among cities, without negative externalities at individual, community and environment level. The creation of a sustainable mobility system concerns areas such as urban planning, engineering, computer science, operations research, business and service management. This article is an attempt to define an integrated framework for the design of sustainable mobility services in cities leveraging individual, community and artificial intelligence. The model moves from a comprehensive analysis of mobility system components and it uses collective intelligence ideas to provide a design tool useful in policy and public decision making. Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual development is based on the review of extant literature, ongoing projects and research initiatives on sustainable mobility. The design framework includes six core elements: 1) the goals that mobility system and services are targeted to; 2) the criteria and metrics which should inform the design of services; 3) the challenges or dimensions to address; 4) the components of a mobility system; 5) the required actions to develop services; and 6) the intelligence backbone. The study adopts an interdisciplinary approach which merges an engineering system perspective with a human-social-structural capital view. Originality/value - The distinguishing element of the work is to investigate mobility systems through complementary socio-technical and intellectual capital perspectives. The framework presented can be of value in the process of defining effective approaches and solutions in mobility management. The article also provides some scenarios of use for the implementation in decision making settings. Practical implications - Implications can be identified at research, policy/practitioner and education level. By a research perspective, the article can support further investigation aimed to define innovative approaches to face the sustainable mobility challenge.

Despite design techniques for learning agents have been discussed in agent oriented software engineering literature, how to identify and analyze the requirements for learning agents is still poorly addressed. In this paper, we introduce a pattern for requirement analysis of learning agents. This analysis pattern contains a group of related, generic meta-classes of learning and their relations in a domain neutral manner which can be described as elements of conceptual modeling of learning requirement of agents. The applicability of the pattern has been investigated through the development of a book trading case study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;978-3-642-22635-9;;;;2011;6788;;;;;;79;90;;;;;;;;;WOS:000306814600005;;;;;;

Classical techniques for network management and control are not conceived to efficiently face such challenges. New mechanisms are required, to work in a self-organized manner. The techniques found in nature promises WSN, to self-adapt the environmental changes and also self-protect itself from the malicious stuff. This paper introduces a biological inspired secure autonomous routing protocol (BIOSARP). The self-optimized routing protocol is enhanced with artificial Immune System (AIS) based autonomous security mechanism. It enhances WSN in securing itself from the abnormalities and most common WSN routing attacks. NS2 based simulation analysis and results of BIOSARP are presented. The comparison of proposed intelligent protocol with SAID and SRTLD security mechanisms for WSN is further exhibited, in terms of processing time and energy consumption.;;;;"A.

These principles involve the retrieval, activation and decay of general-purpose lexical knowledge, inspired by how the brain may process information when someone reads.

Among those are visualization, robotics, multi-dimensional data analysis, artificial intelligence, computational geometry, computer graphics, e-learning, data fusion and data synthesis. The theme of this keynote is reviewing the state of the art in multi-modal data fusion, fuzzy logic and neural networks and its recent connections to advanced biometric research. Over the past decade, multimodal biometric systems emerged as a feasible and practical solution to counterweight the numerous disadvantages of single biometric systems. Active research intoi the design of a multimodal biometric system has started, mainly centered around: types of biometrics, types of data acquisition and decision-making processes. Many challenges originating from non-uniformity of biometric sources and biometric acquisition devices result in significant differences on which information is extracted, how is it correlated, the degree of allowable error, cost implications, ease of data manipulation and management, and also reliability of the decisions being made. With the additional demand of computational power and compact storage, more emphasis is shifted toward database design and computational algorithms. One of the actively researched areas in multimodal biometric systems is information fusion. Which information needs to be fused and what level is needed to obtain the maximum recognition performance is the main focus of current research. In this talk I concentrate on an overview of the current trends in recent multimodal biometric fusion research and illustrate in detail one fusion strategy: rank level fusion. From the discussion, it is seen that rank level fusion often outperforms other methods, especially combined with powerful decision models such as Markov chain or fuzzy logic. Another aspect of multi-modal biometric system development based on neural networks is discussed further. Neural networks have the capacity to simulate learning processes of a human brain and to analyze and compare complex patters, which can originate from either single or multiple biometric sources, with amazing precision. Speed and complexity have been the downsides of neural networks, however, recent advancements in the area, especially in chaotic neural networks, allow these barriers to be overcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;978-3-642-21927-6;;;;2011;6782;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000305796800002;;;;;;

Then it introduces PROFETA, which takes inspiration from AgentSpeak and is designed with the objective of adding declarative constructs (needed by a BDI model) to an object-oriented and imperative language like Python. The result is a flexible environment that combines the power of both the classical object-oriented paradigm useful for algorithm and control loop programming and declarative approach useful for AI and strategy programming.

Thus, there is a need for accurate, efficient, practical methodologies to estimate this biochemical parameter. Hyperspectral measurement is a means of quickly and nondestructively assessing leaf Anth in situ. Wet chemical methods has traditionally been used for this purpose. Recently, NIR(near-infrared)/green, red/green, anthocyanin reflectance index(ARI), and a modified anthocyanin refelctance index(MARI) was been used to estimate the anthocyanin content. In this paper, a an artificial-intelligence technique model was introduced to establish the relationship between the anthocyanin content and reflectance of 400-750nm spectum, variation of species and growth stages. The objective of this study was to test the overall performance and accuracy of this new nondestructive techniques for estimating Anth content in grapevine leaves. Although Anth in validation data set was widely variable, the new methods were capable of accurate predicting Anth content in grapevine leaves with a root mean square error below 1.65 mg/m(2), which is lower than that of MARI or ARI [20]. It documents the facts that such an approach is more suitable for developing simple hand-held field instrumentation for accurate nondestructive Anth estimation and for analyzing digital airborne or satellite imagery to assist in making informed decisions vineyard management.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1868-4238;;978-3-642-18368-3;;;;2011;347;;;;;;47;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000306578000006;;;;;;

However little attention has been concentrated on extraction of the first-order unsatisfiable subformulas.

This chapter proposes a comparison between two different classification approaches on such a problem. Nature-Inspired methodologies are attracting growing interest due to their ability to cope with complex tasks like classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection problems. A swarm intelligence algorithm, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and an artificial immune system algorithm, namely Negative Selection (NS), have been applied to the task of detecting turning points, modeled as an Anomaly Detection (AD) problem. Particular attention has also been given to the choice of the features considered as inputs to the classifiers, due to the significant impact they may have on the overall accuracy of the approach. In this work, starting from a set of eight input features, feature selection has been carried out by means of a greedy hill climbing algorithm, in order to analyze the incidence of feature reduction on the global accuracy of the approach. The performances obtained from the two approaches have also been compared to other traditional machine learning techniques implemented by WEKA and both methods have been found to give interesting results with respect to traditional techniques.;;;;"Tettamanzi, Andrea G.

Named Entity Recognition for biomedical literatures is extraction and recognition of biomedical names. There are different types of NER approaches, that the most common one is dictionary-based approaches. For a given unknown pattern, Dictionary-Based approaches, search through a biomedical dictionary and finds the most common similar patterns to assign their biomedical types to the given unknown pattern. Biomedical literatures include syntax variations, which means two different patterns, refer to the same biomedical named entity. Hence a similarity function should be able to support all of the possible syntax variations. There are three syntax variations namely: (i) character-level, (ii) word-level, and (iii) word order. The SCSS is able to detect all of the mentioned syntax vitiations. This study is evaluated based on two measures: recall and precision which are used to calculate a balanced F-score. Result is satisfied as recall is 92.47% and precision is 96.7%, while the f-test is 94.53%.;;;;"Murad, Masrah Azrifah Azmi/O-6947-2019; Azmi Murad, Masrah Azrifah/L-6536-2015";"Murad, Masrah Azrifah Azmi/0000-0002-0335-5873; Azmi Murad, Masrah Azrifah/0000-0002-0335-5873";;;;;;;;;;;;1865-0929;1865-0937;978-3-642-22184-2;;;;2011;136;;;;;;164;178;;;;;;;;;WOS:000306987900015;;;;;;

The output measurement of clustering, however, is often computation centric (e.g. number of peaks. K) instead of user centric (e.g. quality of the clusters). This creates a big gap between the algorithms and the users, in particular when they are applied to areas such as software services. To address this issue, we propose to use the expected homogeneity degree among entities within a given cluster as the input quality requirements specified by the users to drive the data clustering process. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal by modifying two most widely used clustering methods, K-means and hierarchical, according to the homogeneity degrees of the clustered output results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1865-0929;1865-0937;978-3-642-22184-2;;;;2011;136;;;;;;364;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000306987900031;;;;;;

Search engines plays major role in finding the relevant items from the huge repositories, where different methods are used to find the items to be retrieved. The survey on search engines explores that the Naive users are not satisfying with the current searching results; one of the reason to this problem is lack of capturing the intention of the user by the machine. Artificial intelligence is an emerging area that addresses these problems and trains the search engine to understand the user's interest by inputting training data set.

The proposed function utilizes the query log by considering similarity between ranked item set and the user's preferable ranking. The similarity measure facilitates the risk minimization and also feasible for large set of queries.

However, many events, either too infrequent or outside the business descriptions, are generally not taken into account and, consequently, are not integrated in the a priori definition of the workflow. This kind of exceptions are known as unexpected exceptions. Usually, handling them relies on human interventions that are potentially error prone and could take a lot of time. In this work, we propose a solution to manage unexpected exceptions. To that end, we aim at providing a framework that supports real time automatic management of these exceptions.

To achieve this, a reliable deterioration model is essential in any Bridge Management System (BMS). The deterioration rate is calculated based on historical condition ratings obtained from the structural element-level bridge inspections. Although most bridge authorities have previously conducted inspection and maintenance tasks, these past inspection records are incompatible with what are required by a typical BMS as input. Such incompatibility is a major cause for the deficiency of the current BMS outcomes. Artificial Intelligence (AD-based bridge deterioration model has recently been developed to minimise uncertainties in predicting deterioration of structural bridge members (e.g. beams, piers etc). This model contains two components: (1) using Neural Network-based Backward Prediction Model (BPM) to generate unavailable historical condition ratings; and (2) using Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) to perform long-term performance prediction of bridge structural members. However new problems have emerged in the process of TDNN prediction. This is because the BPM-generated condition ratings are used together with the actual condition ratings. The incompatibility between the two sets of data produces unreliable prediction outcomes during the TDNN process.

It is needed when new version has been filed for fixing a previously reported bug. We present artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance the accuracy of test selection in such a setting. The core technique of our regression testing is an adaptive fitness function that learns how to select test cases based on their similarity to the bug-revealing test cases. The evaluation of similarity between two test cases is in turn based on feature variables extracted with the LCS (longest common subsequences) algorithm. We implemented our techniques with a symbolic simulator of the models of the software under test. We also show how to take the capabilities of the simulator into consideration to learn for better testing performance. Experiment report shows the potentials of applying AI techniques to software verification.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1867-5662;;978-3-642-25657-8;;;;2011;124;;;;;;345;354;;;;;;;;;WOS:000307258900043;;;;;;

Recently, it was used in a compositional program analysis based on separation logic that discovers (partial) pre/post specifications for un-annotated code which approximates memory requirements. Although promising practical results have been obtained, completeness issues and the computational hardness of the problem have not been studied. We consider a fragment of separation logic that is representative of applications in program analysis, and we study the complexity of searching for feasible solutions to abduction. We show that standard entailment is decidable in polynomial time, while abduction ranges from NP-complete to polynomial time for different sub-problems.;;;;Kanovich, Max/M-6531-2015;Gkorogiannis, Kyriakos Nikolaos/0000-0001-8660-6609;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;"978-3-642-23701-0; 978-3-642-23702-7";;;;2011;6887;;;;;;25;42;;;;;;;;;WOS:000306978900007;;;;;;

This approach was compared against a 'random' one. Comparisons were made using 'experiences' derived from three different databases, i.e. problems by human composers (HC), computer-generated compositions that used the HC experience (CG), and mating 'combinations' taken from tournament games between humans (TG). Each showed a reasonable and statistically significant increase in efficiency compared to the random one but not each other. Aesthetically, the HC and CG were better than the others. The results suggest that composing efficiency and quality can be improved using simple probability information derived from human compositions, and unexpectedly even from the computer-generated compositions that result. Additionally, these improvements come at a very low computational cost. They can be used to further aid and entertain human players and composers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-24499-5;;;;2011;6972;;;;;;186;197;;;;;;;;;WOS:000306728900020;;;;;;

Digital technologies allow generation of precise orthoimages, which are obtaining the pixel accuracy. The realization of this process requires usage of precise and adequate object model that is generated by usage of different data sources. They include irregular set of points created by survey measurements, digitized cartographic data, raster DEM obtained from stereo pairs, or from points' cloud gathered by laser scanning. The main steps of orthorectification are discussed that include georeferencing, orthorectification and mosaicing of images. Georeferencing ensures connection between image coordinates of points and corresponding co-ordinates of georeferenced control points. This allows calculating the parameters for geometric transformation depending on the used model. The preliminary step is generation of digital elevation model. The complex model contains the vector data of break lines in object and data sets for every one facets of the model. Automatic DEM extraction from stereo pairs requires the definition of properties of areas for which the model is generated. The orthorectification step is controlled by the transformation parameters, the used object model and is taking in consideration the hidden parts of the object. The quality of rectified image depends also on the method for grey level interpolation of adjacent pixels. The mosaic forming requires correct segmentation of images and adequate combination the subparts of the images. Important meaning has the method of definition the cutting line between adjacent images, radiometric corrections of mosaic parts and pixel level interpolation in the strip of connection. The control of orthorectification process could be realized by interactive definition of methods and parameters of georeferencing, rectification and mosaicing. The selection of parameters could be done automatically on the basis of formulation the object type, the definition of model restrictions and taking into account the image properties obtained by image analyses. The artificial intelligence principles could be applied for implementation the generation of object model and the orthorectification process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1314-2704;;;;;;2011;;;;;;;313;320;;;;;;;;;WOS:000307366300042;;;;;;

This study uses a computational intelligence tool, i.e., Self-Organizing Map (SOM), in the context of electricity distribution efficiency performance visualization. A SOM-model has been built based on collected data for 2001-2004. It allows the reader to discriminate between the Finnish DSOs' differing operating circumstances. Through clustering and visualization, an overall perspective of the efficiency performance of the DSOs in 2001-2004 is rendered. In addition, such a visualization approach connects the DSO's efficiency performance to its respective operating characteristics, which is otherwise not straightforwardly indicated by only studying efficiency scores. This application provides evidence that visual data mining with the SOM as a complementary approach in electricity distribution regulation and efficiency benchmarking has the potential to be expended to other regulatory practices (e.g., yardstick regulation).;;;;Eklund, Tomas FM/B-8144-2014;Eklund, Tomas FM/0000-0001-7194-3434;;;;;;;;;;;;1865-0929;1865-0937;978-3-642-22602-1;;;;2011;194;;;;;;631;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000307329300055;;;;;;

If a key is badly designed or poorly selected, then the protection fails to provide proper security and improper access can be gained on the sensitive information. This work focuses on the application of a crucial Artificial Intelligence approach in block-based image transposition cipher generation.

The number of rules used to define the Neuro-Fuzzy controller is then pruned. Pruning is utilized effectively to eliminate irrelevant rules in the rule base, thus keeping only the relevant rules. Pruning is performed at various threshold levels without affecting the system performance.

On the other hand, the rapid development of computing technology has equipped a large number of methods to be employed in engineering problems, as well as geotechnical issues. These enhancement consequences the popularity of analytical limit equilibrium methods based on computer aid process. Finding the most critical slip surface is a challenging global optimization problem that is always improved by the latest problem solving procedures. The recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods are making it possible to incorporate advance learning capability into finding procedure of this unique surface. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a suitable search method for optimizing the non-linear functions which employs the concept of bird flock or fish school to gain this goal. This paper utilizes a PSO algorithm in a limit equilibrium slope stability analysis based on the Simplified Bishop Method to find the most critical circular slip surface of a homogenous slope as a real case study.

When solving a CSP, the order in which the variables are selected to be instantiated and the order of the corresponding values to be tried affect the complexity of the search. Hyper-heuristics are flexible methods that provide generality when solving different problems and, within CSP, they can be used to determine the next variable and value to try. They select from a set of low-level heuristics and decide which one to apply at each decision point according to the problem state. This study explores a hyper-heuristic model for variable and value ordering within CSP based on a decision matrix hyper-heuristic that is constructed by going into a local improvement method that changes small portions of the matrix. The results suggest that the approach is able to combine the strengths of different low-level heuristics to perform well on a wide range of instances and compensate for their weaknesses on specific instances.;;;;"Ozcan, Ender/B-4241-2008; Ozcan, Ender/AAV-8755-2020";"Ozcan, Ender/0000-0003-0276-1391; Ozcan, Ender/0000-0003-0276-1391; Ortiz-Bayliss, Jose Carlos/0000-0003-3408-2166";;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;"978-3-642-25323-2; 978-3-642-25324-9";;;;2011;7094;;I;;;;125;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000307744200011;;;;;;

The problem is similar to the planning problem that has been extensively studied in the artificial intelligence (AI) community. However, the direct application of AI planning techniques places an onerous burden on the analyst, and has proven to be difficult in practice. We propose a practical yet rigorous (semi-automated) algorithm for business process derivation from goals. Our approach relies on being able to decompose process goals to a more refined collection of sub-goals whose ontology is aligned with that of the effects of available tasks which can be used to construct the business process. Once process goals are refined to this level, we are able to generate a process design using a procedure that leverages our earlier work on semantic effect annotation of process designs.

To improve search efficiency for Siguo with more branches and the uncertain payoff in the game tree, this paper presents a modified Alpha-Beta Search algorithm, which is called rational varied-depth Alpha-Beta (RVAB). The RVAB The basic ideas of RVAB algorithm is : if player get much information about opponent during playing game, they can do more deep thinking about strategies of game. If player can only get few, very uncertain information about opponent during playing game, they don't think more deep about their strategy because it is worthless for player to speculate the strategies of game under very uncertain.

The parameters were used to extract an optimal feature set for classifying healthy and hypothyroid infant cry using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Specifically, the PSO variants optimize the number of filter banks and number of cepstrum coefficients in MFCC. Based on the values chosen by both PSO variants, the extracted features were then fed to a MLP classifier, which was trained to discriminate between the healthy and hypothyroid infant cry.

We describe the process of mining a large dataset of similar to 50,000-120,000 records x 20 attributes in DB tables, originating from the hospital information system recording over 10 years. This paper concerns only textual attributes with free text input, that means 613,000 text fields in 16 attributes. Each attribute item contains similar to 800-1,500 characters (diagnoses, medications, etc.). The output of this task is a set of ordered/nominal attributes suitable for rule discovery mining. Information mining from textual data becomes a very challenging task when the structure of the text record is very loose without any rules. The task becomes even harder when natural language is used and no apriori knowledge is available. The medical environment itself is also very specific: the natural language used in textual description varies with the personality creating the record, however it is restricted by terminology (i.e. medical terms, medical standards, etc.). Moreover, the typical patient record is filled with typographical errors, duplicates and many (nonstandard) abbreviations. Nature inspired methods have their origin in real nature processes and play an important role in the domain of artificial intelligence. They offer fast and robust solutions to many problems, although they belong to the branch of approximative methods. The high number of individuals and the decentralized approach to task coordination in the studied species revealed high degree of parallelism, self-organization and fault tolerance. First, classical approaches such as basic statistic approaches, word (and word sequence) frequency analysis, etc., have been used to simplify the textual data and provide an overview of the data. Finally, an antinspired self-organizing approach has been used to automatically provide a simplified dominant structure, presenting structure of the records in the human readable form that can be further utilized in the mining process as it describes the vast majority of the records. Note that this project is an ongoing process (and research) and new data are irregularly received from the medical facility, justifying the need for robust and fool-proof algorithms.;;;;"Huptych, Michal/AAC-7158-2020; Huser, Martin/C-4725-2014; Lhotska, Lenka/X-1866-2019; Huser, Martin/S-4705-2019; Chudacek, Vaclav/I-2794-2014; Spilka, Jiri/F-6184-2011";"Lhotska, Lenka/0000-0003-0742-5645; Huser, Martin/0000-0002-2482-4819; Chudacek, Vaclav/0000-0002-4003-8981; Spilka, Jiri/0000-0002-4136-0083";;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-642-23207-7; 978-3-642-23208-4";;;;2011;6865;;;;;;31;38;;;;;;;;;WOS:000310734300003;;;;;;

Prediction of time series data in healthcare such as HIV/AIDS data assumes importance in healthcare management. Statistical techniques such as moving average (MA), weighted moving average (WMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models have limitations in handling the non-linear relationships among the data. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as neural networks are considered to be better for prediction of non-linear data. In general, for complex healthcare data, it may be difficult to obtain high prediction accuracy rates using the statistical or AI models individually. To solve this problem, a hybrid model such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is required. In this paper, we propose an improved ANFIS model to predict HIV/AIDS data. Using two statistical indicators, namely, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is compared with the accuracies obtained with MA, WMA, ARIMA and Neural Network models based on HIV/AIDS data. The results indicate that the proposed model yields improvements as high as 87.84% compared to the other models.;;;;Purwanto, Purwanto/E-9984-2015;Purwanto, Purwanto/0000-0001-5969-9838;;;;;;;;;;;;1865-0929;1865-0937;"978-3-642-25461-1; 978-3-642-25462-8";;;;2011;253;;;;;;1;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000310861200001;;;;;;

If the damage does not exceed such values, measured with the use of intermediate values, which are the criteria for the assessment of exhaust fumes emission, such damage may remain unidentified by the imperfect model of the system. Preliminary tests show that some mechanical damages even over the admissible sizes do not constitute the basis for the reaction of the diagnostic system. At present. failure symptoms found in the signal, are more and more often studied with the aid of artificial intelligence methods. The major issue referred to in the literature related to methods of artificial intelligence is the method for creating the data used in the process of neural network operations.

Darwin's theory of natural selection has fueled a vast amount of research in the field of computer science, and more specifically in artificial intelligence. The majority of this work has focussed on artificial selection, rather than on natural selection. In this paper we study the evolution of agents' controllers in an open-ended scenario. To that end, we set up a multi-agent simulation inspired by the ant foraging task, and evolve the agents' brain (a rule list) without any explicit fitness function.

But there exist some inadequacies related to the stochastic error models of inertial sensors, requirement of prior knowledge in fusing data and long design time. Moreover, recently artificial intelligence (AI) techniques based on static neural networks were suggested in place of kalman filter. But there also exist drawbacks like inadequate training during GPS absence, less reliability and more training time. To solve this problem, a new dynamic architecture based on Input-delayed model has been developed. This paper, therefore proposes a scheme based on Improved Input-delayed dynamic neural network (IIDDNN) to model the samples of INS values with respect to GPS values as target vectors (Normal mode). This model is capable of providing a reliable and accurate solution especially for GPS absence (prediction mode). The prediction mode output obtained using IIDDNN is compared with the performance of normal mode of IIDDNN. The proposed IIDDNN model is evaluated using test data of fixed trajectory path for an aircraft vehicle.;;;;V, Vaidehi/N-5562-2016;V, Vaidehi/0000-0002-9524-5291;;;;;;;;;;;;1865-0929;;"978-3-642-24042-3; 978-3-642-24043-0";;;;2011;204;;;;;;654;+;;;;;;;;;WOS:000310945500067;;;;;;

Dramatic speedup might be achieved by appropriately mapping the current inference algorithms to the parallel framework. Parallel exact inference methods still suffer from exponential complexity in the worst case. Approximate inference methods have been parallelized and good speedup is achieved. In this paper, we focus on a variant of Belief Propagation algorithm. This variant has better convergent property and is provably convergent under certain conditions. We show that this method is amenable to coarse-grained parallelization and propose techniques to optimally parallelize it without sacrificing convergence.

Artificial intelligence techniques like artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) have been applied to the LD diagnosis problem with satisfactory outcomes. However, special education teachers or professionals tend to be skeptical to these kinds of black-box predictors. In this study, we adopt the rough set theory (RST), which can not only perform as a classifier, but may also produce meaningful explanations or rules, to the LD diagnosis application. Our experiments indicate that the RST approach is competitive as a tool for feature selection, and it performs better in term of prediction accuracy than other rule-based algorithms such as decision tree and ripper algorithms. We also propose to mix samples collected from sources with different LD diagnosis procedure and criteria. By pre-processing these mixed samples with simple and readily available clustering algorithms, we are able to improve the quality and support of rules generated by the RST. Overall, our study shows that the rough set approach, as a classification and knowledge discovery tool, may have great potential in playing an essential role in LD diagnosis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1875-6883;;;;;FEB;2011;4;1;;;;;29;43;;10.1080/18756891.2011.9727761;;;;;;;WOS:000286636000004;;;;;;

J;"Bou, F; Rivieccio, U";;;;"Bou, Felix; Rivieccio, Umberto";;;The logic of distributive bilattices;LOGIC JOURNAL OF THE IGPL;;;;;;;;;;;;Bilattices, introduced by Ginsberg (1988, Comput. Intell., 265-316) as a uniform framework for inference in artificial intelligence, are algebraic structures that proved useful in many fields. In recent years, Arieli and Avron (1996, J. Logic Lang. Inform., 5, 25-63) developed a logical system based on a class of bilattice-based matrices, called logical bilattices, and provided a Gentzen-style calculus for it. This logic is essentially an expansion of the well-known Belnap-Dunn four-valued logic to the standard language of bilattices. Our aim is to study Arieli and Avron's logic from the perspective of abstract algebraic logic (AAL). We introduce a Hilbert-style axiomatization in order to investigate the properties of the algebraic models of this logic, proving that every formula can be reduced to an equivalent normal form and that our axiomatization is complete w.r.t. Arieli and Avron's semantics. In this way, we are able to classify this logic according to the criteria of AAL. We show, for instance, that it is non-protoalgebraic and non-self-extensional. We also characterize its Tarski congruence and the class of algebraic reducts of its reduced generalized models, which in the general theory of AAL is usually taken to be the algebraic counterpart of a sentential logic. This class turns out to be the variety generated by the smallest non-trivial bilattice, which is strictly contained in the class of algebraic reducts of logical bilattices. On the other hand, we prove that the class of algebraic reducts of reduced models of our logic is strictly included in the class of algebraic reducts of its reduced generalized models. Another interesting result obtained is that, as happens with some implicationless fragments of well-known logics, we can associate with our logic a Gentzen calculus which is algebraizable in the sense of Rebagliato and Verdu (1995, Algebraizable Gentzen Systems and the Deduction of Theorem for Gentzen Systems) (even if the logic itself is not algebraizable). We also prove some purely algebraic results concerning bilattices, for instance that the variety of (unbounded) distributive bilattices is generated by the smallest non-trivial bilattice. This result is based on an improvement of a theorem by Avron (1996, Math. Struct. Comput. Sci., 6, 287-299) stating that every bounded interlaced bilattice is isomorphic to a certain product of two bounded lattices. We generalize it to the case of unbounded interlaced bilattices (of which distributive bilattices are a proper subclass).;;;;Rivieccio, Umberto/D-5309-2019;Rivieccio, Umberto/0000-0003-1364-5003;;;;;;;;;;;;1367-0751;1368-9894;;;;FEB;2011;19;1;;;;;183;216;;10.1093/jigpal/jzq041;;;;;;;WOS:000286993700013;;;;;;

What exiting tools, then, might facilitate compliance with a variety of biofuel-related sustainability criteria? This paper presents four existing tools and methodologies that can help stakeholders assess (and mitigate) potential risks associated with feedstock production, and can thus facilitate compliance with requirements under different requirement systems. These include the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT), the ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES) tool, the Responsible Cultivation Areas (RCA) methodology, and the related Biofuels + Forest Carbon (Biofuel + FC) methodology.;;;;Paglia, Adriano P/A-7965-2012;Paglia, Adriano P/0000-0001-9957-5506;;;;;;;;;;;;1367-5435;1476-5535;;;;FEB;2011;38;2;;;;;371;374;;10.1007/s10295-010-0858-7;;;;;;;WOS:000286470000013;20878443;;;;;

Realistic environments typically feature a variable number of objects, relations amongst them, and non-deterministic transition behavior. While standard probabilistic sequence models provide efficient inference and learning techniques for sequential data, they typically cannot fully capture the relational complexity. On the other hand, statistical relational learning techniques are often too inefficient to cope with complex sequential data. In this paper, we introduce a simple model that occupies an intermediate position in this expressiveness/efficiency trade-off. It is based on CP-logic (Causal Probabilistic Logic), an expressive probabilistic logic for modeling causality. However, by specializing CP-logic to represent a probability distribution over sequences of relational state descriptions and employing a Markov assumption, inference and learning become more tractable and effective. Specifically, we show how to solve part of the inference and learning problems directly at the first-order level, while transforming the remaining part into the problem of computing all satisfying assignments for a Boolean formula in a binary decision diagram. We experimentally validate that the resulting technique is able to handle probabilistic relational domains with a substantial number of objects and relations.;;;;;De Raedt, Luc/0000-0002-6860-6303;;;;;;;;;;;;0885-6125;1573-0565;;;;FEB;2011;82;2;;;SI;;239;272;;10.1007/s10994-010-5213-8;;;;;;;WOS:000288121900007;;;;;;
J;Matveyev, Y;;;;Matveyev, Yoel;;;Between Enlightenment and Romanticism: Computational Kabbalah of Rabbi Pinchas Elijah Hurwitz;HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF LOGIC;;;;;;;;;;;;This article shows that Rabbi Pinchas Elijah Hurwitz, a major eighteenth-century kabbalist, Orthodox rabbi and Enlightenment thinker, who merged Lurianic Kabbalah with Kantian philosophy, attempted to describe God and the world in terms of formal grammars and abstract information processes. He resolves a number of Kant's dualistic views by introducing prophecy as a tool that allows a mystic's mind to perform transfinite hypercomputation and to obtain a priori knowledge about things usually known only a posteriori. According to Hurwitz, the reality consists of Divine names, which generate an infinite network of recursive string rewriting systems, some of which are identical to what is known today as Lindenmayer systems. Hurwitz is also one of the first thinkers, who raised questions about non-human and artificial intelligence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0144-5340;;;;;FEB;2011;32;1;;;;;85;101;;10.1080/01445340.2010.506106;;;;;;;WOS:000287100300008;;;;;;

Thus, motion artifacts cancellation is important for the monitoring system of wearable health shirt. This paper proposes an artificial intelligence algorithm in estimating the motion artifacts occurred to the Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals captured by wearable health shirt. The major limitation of involving artificial intelligence in motion artifacts cancellation is the long duration of time required to complete the motion artifacts cancellation process. This was due to the complexity of the training process. This paper proposes a new method to overcome this limitation and enables the involvement of artificial intelligence in real-time motion artifacts cancellation.

When a skin lesion presents these features it is excised as prevention. Using a non-invasive technique called dermoscopy, dermatologists can give a more accurate evaluation of skin lesions, and can therefore avoid the excision of lesions that are benign. However, dermatologists need to achieve a good dermatoscopic classification of lesions prior to extraction. In this paper we propose a procedure called LazyCL to support dermatologists in assessing the classification of skin lesions. Our goal is to use LazyCL for generating a domain theory to classify melanomas in situ. Methods: To generate a domain theory, the LazyCL procedure uses a combination of two artificial intelligence techniques: case-based reasoning and clustering. First LazyCL randomly creates clusters and then uses a lazy learning method called lazy induction of descriptions (LID) with leave-one-out on them. By means of LID, LazyCL collects explanations of why the cases in the database should belong to a class. Then the analysis of relationships among explanations produces an understandable clustering of the dataset. After a process of elimination of redundancies and merging of clusters, the set of explanations is reduced to a subset of it describing classes that are almost discriminant. The remaining explanations form a preliminary domain theory that is the basis on which experts can perform knowledge discovery. Results: We performed two kinds of experiments. First ones consisted on using LazyCL on a database containing the description of 76 melanomas. The domain theory obtained from these experiments was compared on previous experiments performed using a different clustering method called self-organizing maps (SOM). Results of both methods, LazyCL and SOM, were similar. The second kind of experiments consisted on using LazyCL on well known domains coming from the machine learning repository of the Irvine University. Thus, since these domains have known solution classes, we can prove that the clusters build by LazyCL are correct. Conclusions: We can conclude that LazyCL that uses explained case-based reasoning for knowledge discovery is feasible for constructing a domain theory. On one hand, experiments on the melanoma database show that the domain theory build by LazyCL is easy to understand. Explanations provided by LID are easily understood by domain experts since these descriptions involve the same attributes than they used to represent domain objects. On the other hand, experiments on standard machine learning data sets show that LazyCL is a good method of clustering since all clusters produced are correct. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, CBR applications to the medical domain are considered. Methods and material: After a quick survey on the definition and on the role of context in artificial intelligence research, we have focused on CBR, with a particular emphasis on medical applications. In this field, we have identified a number of very recent contributions, which strongly recognize context per se as a major knowledge source. These contributions propose to maintain and to rely on contextual information, in order to support human reasoning in different fashions. Results: We have distinguished three main directions in which contextual knowledge can be resorted to, in order to optimize physicians' decision making. Such directions can be summarized as follows: (1) to reduce the search space in the case retrieval step: (2) to maintain the overall knowledge content always valid and up to date, and (3) to adapt knowledge application and reasoning to local/personal constraints. We have also properly categorized the surveyed works within these three clusters, and identified the most significant ones, able to exploit contextual knowledge along more than one direction. Conclusions: Innovative applications of the contextual knowledge recorded in the case library, described and systematized in this paper, can trace promising research directions for the future.

J;Pieters, W;;;;Pieters, Wolter;;;Explanation and trust: what to tell the user in security and AI?;ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY;;;;;;;;;;;;There is a common problem in artificial intelligence (AI) and information security. In AI, an expert system needs to be able to justify and explain a decision to the user. In information security, experts need to be able to explain to the public why a system is secure. In both cases, an important goal of explanation is to acquire or maintain the users' trust. In this paper, I investigate the relation between explanation and trust in the context of computing science. This analysis draws on literature study and concept analysis, using elements from system theory as well as actor-network theory. I apply the conceptual framework to both AI and information security, and show the benefit of the framework for both fields by means of examples. The main focus is on expert systems (AI) and electronic voting systems (security). Finally, I discuss consequences of the analysis for ethics in terms of (un)informed consent and dissent, and the associated division of responsibilities.;;;;Pieters, Wolter/M-8847-2017;;;;;;;;;;;;;1388-1957;1572-8439;;;;MAR;2011;13;1;;;;;53;64;;10.1007/s10676-010-9253-3;;;;;;;WOS:000287581900006;;;;;;

Substances and methods used to increase oxygen blood transport and physical performance can be detected in the blood, but the screening of the athletes to be tested remains a critical issue for the International Federations. This project, AR.I.E.T.T.A., aimed to develop a software capable of analysing athletes' hematological and performance profiles to detect abnormal patterns. Methods. One-hundred eighty athletes belonging to the International Biathlon Union gave written informed consent to have their hematological data, previously collected according to anti-doping rules, used to develop the AR.I.E.T.T.A. software. Results. Software was developed with the included sections: 1) log-in; 2) data-entry: where data are loaded, stored and grouped; 3) analysis: where data are analysed, validated scores are calculated, and parameters are simultaneously displayed as statistics, tables and graphs, and individual or subpopulation profiles; 4) screening: where an immediate evaluation of the risk score of the present sample and/or the athlete under study is obtained. The sample risk score or AR.I.E.T.T.A. score is calculated by a simple computational system combining different parameters (absolute values and intra-individual variations) considered concurrently. The AR.I.E.T.T.A. score is obtained by the sum of the deviation units derived from each parameter, considering the shift of the present value from the reference values, based on the number of standard deviations. Conclusion. AR.I.E.T.T.A. enables a quick evaluation of blood results assisting surveillance programs and perform timely target testing controls on athletes by the International Federations. Future studies aiming to validate the AR.I.E.T.T.A. score and improve the diagnostic accuracy will improve the system.";;;;"Malagoni, Anna Maria/K-4974-2016; Manfredini, Fabio/ABG-2372-2020";"Malagoni, Anna Maria/0000-0002-3362-4691; Manfredini, Fabio/0000-0001-9476-6434";;;;;;;;;;;;0022-4707;1827-1928;;;;MAR;2011;51;1;;;;;153;159;;;;;;;;;WOS:000289590400020;21297575;;;;;
J;Kane, B;;;;Kane, Brian;;;Excavating Lewin's Phenomenology;MUSIC THEORY SPECTRUM;;;;;;;;;;;;"David Lewin's Music Theory, Phenomenology, and Modes of Perception is a touchstone for phenomenologically influenced music theory, yet something puzzling remains about the role of perception in Lewin's phenomenology. On the one hand, Lewin emphasizes the embodied nature of perception by arguing that perception is itself a type of skill, a mode of response, which manifests itself in an infinite number of creative acts. On the other hand, he explicitly employs phenomenology in only a limited manner; in Parts I-III of his essay, he sets up his phenomenological p-model, and then, in Part V, critiques it as ultimately inadequate for forging a link between perception and creation. In this essay, I offer a solution to this puzzle by examining Lewin's sources. I argue that he is indebted to the school of West Coast phenomenology in two respects: (1) that Lewin's style of phenomenology is influenced by the Fregean interpretation of Husserl, which supports the ontological and categorical split between perceptual sense and reference presented in the p-model; (2) that the general argument presented in Lewin's essay, which moves from the p-model toward a critique of disembodied perception, is modeled on Hubert Dreyfus's two-stage argument against Artificial Intelligence.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0195-6167;;;;;SPR;2011;33;1;;;;;27;36;;10.1525/mts.2011.33.1.27;;;;;;;WOS:000290001000002;;;;;;

We begin with an analysis of a philosophical model of trust based on Richard Holton's interpretation of P. F. Strawson's writings on freedom and resentment, and we show why this account of trust is difficult to extend to artificial agents (AAs) as well as to other non-human entities. We then examine Margaret Urban Walker's notions of default trust and default, diffuse trust to see how these concepts can inform our analysis of trust in the context of AAs. In the final section, we show how ethicists can improve their understanding of important features in the trust relationship by examining data resulting from a classic experiment involving AAs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1388-1957;;;;;MAR;2011;13;1;;;;;39;51;;10.1007/s10676-010-9249-z;;;;;;;WOS:000287581900005;;;;;;
J;Niiniluoto, I;;;;Niiniluoto, Ilkka;;;Abduction, tomography, and other inverse problems;STUDIES IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE;;;;;;;;;;;;Charles S. Peirce introduced in the late 19(th) century the notion of abduction as inference from effects to causes, or from observational data to explanatory theories. Abductive reasoning has become a major theme in contemporary logic, philosophy of science, and artificial intelligence. This paper argues that the new growing branch of applied mathematics called inverse problems deals successfully with various kinds of abductive inference within a variety of scientific disciplines. The fundamental theorem about the inverse reconstruction of plane functions from their line integrals was proved by Johann Radon already in 1917. The practical applications of Radon's theorem and its generalizations include computerized tomography which became a routine imaging technique of diagnostic medicine in the 1970s.

The more important variables in the process are the aluminum concentration generated in the system and pH, but the concentration of pollutant, salinity, electrocoagulation time, and operation current density also significantly affect the process performance. The process is complex and phenomenological models usually are unsuccessful in reproducing experimental observations. In this work, an artificial intelligence modeling tool based on neural networks has been applied in order to study the electrocoagulation process of a synthetic wastewater polluted with colloids. The obtained results were useful in clarifying the mechanisms that are involved in the electrocoagulation of this kind of wastes and also in studying the influence of the operation conditions on the efficiency of the process. Different types of neural networks were used to predict the increasing of the removal turbidity and voltage current as a result of the influence of other parameters such as: current density, time, pH, concentrations of kaolin and NaCl. The best results, with global errors under 2.5 % in the validation stage, were obtained using a multilayer perceptron network and a generalized feed-forward neural network.;;;;"Pislaru, Marius/G-4452-2011; Pislaru, Marius/AAQ-2446-2020; Curteanu, Silvia/D-7347-2011; Piuleac, Ciprian G/C-3848-2012";"Curteanu, Silvia/0000-0002-5281-1265; Piuleac, Ciprian G/0000-0003-1006-5425; Pislaru, Marius/0000-0003-3695-3463";;;;;;;;;;;;1582-9596;1843-3707;;;;MAR;2011;10;3;;;;;375;380;;;;;;;;;WOS:000290921300008;;;;;;

In the present study the changing processes of digital pathology in Japan were investigated and trends to future were discussed. Methods: The changing status of digital pathology was investigated through reviewing the records of annual meetings of the Japanese Research Society of Telepathology and Pathology Informatics (JRST-PI) and of the Japanese pathology related medical and informatics journals. The results of the Japanese questionnaire survey conducted in 2008-2009 on telepathology and virtual slide were also reviewed. In addition effectiveness of an experimental automatic pathology diagnostic aid system using computer artificial intelligence was investigated by checking its rate of correct diagnosis for given prostate carcinoma digital images. Results: Telepathology played a central role in the development of digital pathology in Japan. Both macroscopic and microscopic pathology digital images were routinely generated and used for diagnostic purposes in major hospitals. Virtual slide (VS) digital images were used first for education then for conference, consultation and also gradually for routine diagnosis and telepathology. The experimental automatic diagnostic aid system achieved the rate of correct diagnosis around 95% for prostate carcinoma and its use for automatic mapping of cancerous areas in a given tissue image was successful. Conclusions: Advance in the digital information technologies gave revolutionary impacts on pathology education, conference, consultation, diagnosis, telepathology and also on pathology diagnostic procedures in Japan. The future will be bright for pathologists by the advanced digital pathology but we should pay attention to make the technologies and their effects under our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1746-1596;;;;;MAR 30;2011;6;;;1;;;;;S19;10.1186/1746-1596-6-S1-S19;;;;;;;WOS:000290234600019;21489189;;;;;

This problem was first formulated in 1981 by Ken Knowlton in a patent application, which was finally granted in 1983. Domino portraits have been generated most often using integer linear programming techniques that provide optimal solutions, but these can be slow and do not scale well to larger portraits. In this paper we propose a new approach that overcomes these limitations and provides high quality portraits. Our approach combines techniques from operations research, artificial intelligence, and computer vision. Starting from a randomly generated template of blank domino shapes, a subsequent optimal placement of dominoes can be achieved in constant time when the problem is viewed as a minimum cost flow. The domino portraits one obtains are good, but not as visually attractive as optimal ones. Combining techniques from computer vision and large neighborhood search we can quickly improve the portraits.

It is explained how defeasible reasoning of the most common sort can deteriorate into fallacious argumentation in some instances. Conditions are formulated that can be used as normative tools to judge whether a given defeasible argument is fallacious or not.

J;Prakken, H;;;;Prakken, Henry;;;Argumentation Without Arguments;ARGUMENTATION;;;;;;;;;;;;A well-known ambiguity in the term 'argument' is that of argument as an inferential structure and argument as a kind of dialogue. In the first sense, an argument is a structure with a conclusion supported by one or more grounds, which may or may not be supported by further grounds. Rules for the construction and criteria for the quality of arguments in this sense are a matter of logic. In the second sense, arguments have been studied as a form of dialogical interaction, in which human or artificial agents aim to resolve a conflict of opinion by verbal means. Rules for conducting such dialogues and criteria for their quality are part of dialogue theory. Usually, formal accounts of argumentation dialogues in logic and artificial intelligence presuppose an argument-based logic. That is, the ways in which dialogue participants support and attack claims are modelled as the construction of explicit arguments and counterarguments (in the inferential sense). However, in this paper formal models of argumentation dialogues are discussed that do not presuppose arguments as inferential structures. The motivation for such models is that there are forms of inference that are not most naturally cast in the form of arguments (such as abduction, statistical reasoning and coherence-based reasoning) but that can still be the subject of argumentative dialogue. Some recent work in artificial intelligence is discussed which embeds non-argumentative inference in an argumentative dialogue system, and some general observations are drawn from this discussion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0920-427X;;;;;MAY;2011;25;2;;;;;171;184;;10.1007/s10503-011-9208-9;;;;;;;WOS:000292158300004;;;;;;

We demonstrate that is possible to learn to use episodic memory retrievals while simultaneously learning to act in an external environment. In a series of three experiments, we investigate using RL to learn what to retrieve from episodic memory and when to retrieve it, how to use temporal episodic memory retrievals, and how to build cues that are the conjunctions of multiple features. In these experiments, our empirical results demonstrate that it is computationally feasible to learn to use episodic memory; furthermore, learning to use internal episodic memory accomplishes tasks that reinforcement learning alone cannot. These experiments also expose some important interactions that arise between reinforcement learning and episodic memory. In a fourth experiment, we demonstrate that an agent endowed with a simple bit memory cannot learn to use it effectively. This indicates that mechanistic characteristics of episodic memory may be essential to learning to use it, and that these characteristics are not shared by simpler memory mechanisms.

To do so, we must learn an accurate environment model, and then plan to maximize reward. Unfortunately, learning algorithms often recover a model that is too inaccurate to support planning or too large and complex for planning to succeed; or they require excessive prior domain knowledge or fail to provide guarantees such as statistical consistency. To address this gap, we propose a novel algorithm which provably learns a compact, accurate model directly from sequences of action-observation pairs. We then evaluate the learner by closing the loop from observations to actions. In more detail, we present a spectral algorithm for learning a predictive state representation (PSR), and evaluate it in a simulated, vision-based mobile robot planning task, showing that the learned PSR captures the essential features of the environment and enables successful and efficient planning. Our algorithm has several benefits which have not appeared together in any previous PSR learner: it is computationally efficient and statistically consistent; it handles high-dimensional observations and long time horizons; and, our close-the-loop experiments provide an end-to-end practical test.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0278-3649;;;;;JUN;2011;30;7;;;SI;;954;966;;10.1177/0278364911404092;;;;;;;WOS:000291929100010;;;;;;

Advocates of AI argue the contrary. Even so, both Descartes and classical AI envisage the possibility that thought and intelligence need not be instantiated by physical properties. Such a possibility is entertained by Descartes through a modal intuition according to which mind can exist without body, an idea which seems to have been endorsed by classical AI when it reduces mind to a Turing Machine whose physical realization is irrelevant. Even though both arguments presuppose different theories and consequences, Functionalism turns out to be compatible with a form of Dualism, which discards the Materialism that originally inspired classical Artificial Intelligence.;;;;Gonzalez, Rodrigo/P-3907-2018;Gonzalez, Rodrigo/0000-0001-9693-0541;;;;;;;;;;;;0718-2201;;;;;JUL;2011;;32;;;;;181;198;;;;;;;;;WOS:000305982300014;;;;;;

Previous research on Groebner Bases expert systems has so far been connected to modeling expert systems based on propositional logics. Our approach instead is based on the well-known Artificial Intelligence 'Concept-Attribute-Value' paradigm for representing knowledge. More precisely, our research is based on translating an already existent expert system described in terms of the 'Concept-Attribute-Value' paradigm to a new algebraic model which represents knowledge by means of polynomials. In this way, issues about consistence and inference within this expert system will be, through this new model, transformed into algebraic problems involving calculating Groebner Bases. By using this new model of ours, some interesting advantages ensue: on the one hand, knowledge representation may be performed in a more straightforward and intuitive way; on the other, calculating the Groebner Bases associated to our algebraic model is usually faster adopting this new 'Concept-Attribute-Value'-based paradigm than it was in previous propositional logic-based expert systems.

Pre and post-condition rules for the speech acts determine when a particular speech act can be put forward as a move in the dialogue, and what type of move or moves must follow it. A successful explanation has been achieved when there has been a transfer of understanding from the party giving the explanation to the party asking for it. The dialogue has an opening stage, an explanation stage and a closing stage. Whether a transfer of understanding has taken place is tested by a dialectical shift to an examination dialogue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0039-7857;;;;;OCT;2011;182;3;;;;;349;374;;10.1007/s11229-010-9745-z;;;;;;;WOS:000294542100002;;;;;;

The article argues that progress in philosophy has been impeded, in part, by two specific constraints imposed on us by the natural architecture of our cognitive systems. Both of these constraints, though, could in principle be overcome by certain cognitive technologies currently being researched and/or developed. It surveys a number of these technologies, and then looks at a particular metaphilosophical stance (called inflationism) that advocates amplifying the abilities of philosophers rather than reducing the ambitions of philosophy, given the apparent teleological gap between philosophy's ultimate goal (i.e., the truth) and the limited capacities of our evolved mental machinery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0026-1068;1467-9973;;;;OCT;2011;42;5;;;;;682;707;;10.1111/j.1467-9973.2011.01715.x;;;;;;;WOS:000296044600009;;;;;;

Although, in many cases, what we find under this label are computerized routines mainly used in e-learning collaborative proceses involving argumentation, either as an educational means or an educational goal, there are also other studies in which the concept of script plays a more theoretical role as the kind of commonly human cognitive structure that could account for the way in which argumentation might develop in ordinary language and ordinary settings. We aim at exploring these latter possibilities, differentiating between the global ascription of the script concept to argumentation practices as procedural and regulated actions from the somewhat more suggestive association between socially shared scripts (expected narratives, plausible sequences, customary experiences, etc.) and the way some enthymemes work from an interactive, rhetorical perspective. The concept of script could help us understand some more procedural than propositional aspects of the cognitive sets shared by arguer and audience and account for the communicative success of apparently defective argumentation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0920-427X;;;;;NOV;2011;25;4;;;;;415;426;;10.1007/s10503-011-9212-0;;;;;;;WOS:000296833900001;;;;;;

Although used abundantly to justify our interest in ancient societies, this statement lacks practical meaning due to the high degree of uncertainty which cloaks archaeological studies and theories, and the fact that there is no real way to prove or validate them. That is why it is so important to approach this study from a multidisciplinary point of view, providing several inputs which complement each other and so maximize the amount of factual information drawn from the analysis. Even then, the study will never be truly complete because there will always be a missing document, a small trace of an object (Verhagen, 2008), that still needs to be analysed. This paper aims to be a useful contribution to historical research, specifically to the study of architectural history. Its purpose is to create a series of methods and tools for testing and analysing theories and hypotheses for historical scenarios (Vasaros, 2008) through the use of 3D modelling tools and Virtual Reality (VR) engines. The project was developed in two stages: The first was the creation of several three-dimensional (3D) models, each representing a different theory or hypothesis. The models were based on accurate Computer Assisted Design (CAD) (Autodesk (R) AutoCAD) models for the reconstruction of the buildings, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) (ESRI (R)) for the recreation of the terrain, thereby creating a realistic representation of what exists now, and a close approximation to what may have once existed. In the second stage, a simplified version of the models was imported into a Virtual Reality (VR) game engine (Bethesda Softworks (R)) to create the ambience of the villa at the time, allowing full exploration of the space. It also includes fauna and flora, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven avatars, as can be seen in the Video 1 provided in the electronic version of this manuscript. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

D.";;;Intelligent Production Modeling Using Full Field Pattern Recognition;SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION & ENGINEERING;;;;;SPE Western Regional Meeting;MAY 27-29, 2010;Anaheim, CA;SPE;;;;Production-data analysis has been applied extensively to predicting future production performance and field recovery. These applications operate mostly on a single-well basis. This paper presents a new approach to production-data analysis using artificial-intelligence (AI) techniques in which production history is used to build a fieldwide performance-prediction model. In this work, AI and data-driven modeling are used to predict future production of both synthetic- (for validation purposes) and real-field cases. In the approach presented in this article, production history is paired with field geological information to build data sets containing the spatio-temporal dependencies among different wells. These dependencies are addressed by compiling information from closest offset wells (COWs) that includes their geological and reservoir characteristics (spatial data) as well as their production history (temporal data). Once the data set is assembled, a series of neural networks are trained using a back-propagation algorithm. These networks are then fused together to form the intelligent time-successive production-modeling (ITSPM) system. This technique uses only the widely available measured data such as well logs and production history of existing wells to predict future performance of the existing wells and production performance of the new (mull) wells. To demonstrate the applicability of this method, a synthetic oil reservoir is modeled using a commercial simulator. Production and well-log data are extracted into an all-inclusive data set. Several neural networks are trained and validated to predict different stages of the production. The ITSPM method is used to estimate the production profile for nine new wells in the reservoir. Furthermore, ITSPM is also applied to two giant oil fields in the Middle East. The first one has more than 200 wells and 40 years of production history. ITSPM's production predictions of the four newest wells in this reservoir are compared with their actual production. The second real field has hundreds of wells producing from multiple layers. The field has undergone waterflooding for almost its whole life. This case also shows the capabilities of this technique in more-complex scenarios and especially multiphase systems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1094-6470;;;;;DEC;2011;14;6;;;;;735;749;;10.2118/132643-PA;;;;;;;WOS:000299192000008;;;;;;

Because of the vigorous research taking place in fields related to osteoporosis, bone biologists are overwhelmed by the amount of literature being generated on a regular basis. This problem can be alle-viated by inferring and extracting novel relationships among biological entities appearing in the biological literature. With the development of large online publicly available databases of biological literature, such an approach becomes even more appealing. The novel relationships between biological terms thus discovered constitute new hypotheses that can be verified using experiments. This paper presents a novel method called multilevel text mining for the extraction of potentially meaningful biological relationships. Multilevel mining uses transitive maximum flow graph analysis coupled with set combination operations of union and intersection. Set operators are applied along and across the paths of a transitive flow graph to combine the data. In the first level of the multilevel mining process, protein domain names are used. Novel relationships between domains are extracted by the transitive text mining analysis. In the second level, these newly discovered relationships are used to extract relevant protein names. Set operators are used in various combinations to obtain different sets of results.

In this frame, background subtraction (BS) method is a well-known method in video processing and it is based on frame differencing. The basic idea is to subtract the current frame from a background image and to classify each pixel either as foreground or background by comparing the difference with a threshold. Therefore, the moving object is detected and tracked by using frame differencing and by learning an updated background model. In addition, simulated annealing (SA) is an optimization technique for soft computing in the artificial intelligence area. The p-median problem is a basic model of discrete location theory of operational research (OR) area. It is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. The main aim in the p-median problem is to find p number facility locations, minimize the total weighted distance between demand points (nodes) and the closest facilities to demand points. The SA method is used to solve the p-median problem as a probabilistic metaheuristic. In this paper, an SA-based hybrid method called entropy-based SA (EbSA) is developed for performance optimization of BS, which is used to detect and track object(s) in videos. The SA modification to the BS method (SA-BS) is proposed in this study to determine the optimal threshold for the foreground-background (i.e., bi-level) segmentation and to learn background model for object detection. At these segmentation and learning stages, all of the optimization problems considered in this study are taken as p-median problems. Performances of SA-BS and regular BS methods are measured using four videoclips. Therefore, these results are evaluated quantitatively as the overall results of the given method.

Data clustering under rough set theory can be considered as a technique for medical decision making. One possible application is the clustering of student suffering study's anxiety. In this paper, we present the applicability of variable precision rough set model for clustering student suffering studies anxiety. The proposed technique is based on the mean of accuracy of approximation using variable precision of attributes. The datasets are taken from a survey aimed to identify of studies anxiety sources among students at Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP). At this stage of the research, we show how variable precision rough set model can be used to groups student in each study's anxiety. The results may potentially contribute to give a recommendation how to design intervention, to conduct a treatment in order to reduce anxiety and further to improve student's academic performance.

The second part describes our solution - an expert system for evaluation of ecological stability and function of the landscape, which is based on ArcGIS products and EMDS. Expert systems are computer programmes able to simulate actions of an expert in a particular field when solving complicated tasks. They are considered a sub-category of knowledge-bases systems. Spatial Decision Support Systems are closely related to knowledge-based and expert systems whose creation was possible due to artificial intelligence. Generally it is credited two basic roles in the process of decision support: a) GIS is used for better decision support, because it helps to collect, organize, analyse and properly visualize data that the user uses to solve the problem. The decision on the appropriateness of solutions can be used modelling alternative scenarios and then compare their critical parameters, b) GIS is widely used in solving specific SDSS problems, which are geared to location and allocation problems and highly applicable in the event of network analysis. For the application of GIS in the SDSS it is specific that, in addition to building a data structure, which is the primary reason for deployment, significantly applied and specific methods for determining their own GIS technology. The designed expert system enables a multidisciplinary view of a landscape being assessed from the four given viewpoints by the chosen methodologies. The used methods of assessment have been known for some time and occasionally used for GIS. The expert system is beneficial for these two aspects: i) determining all four relations from minimum consistent data at the same time, ii) formalised marking of reclassifying, assigning coefficients and ascribing weights to the factors. Thanks to the documented methodologies for data preparation, development of particular dependency networks and assessment procedure in EMDS, the expert system can be also used for other areas of interest.;;;;"Pechanec, Vilem/J-1877-2014; Brus, Jan/D-8406-2013";"Pechanec, Vilem/0000-0001-6728-6646; Brus, Jan/0000-0001-5613-9798";;;;;;;;;;;;1314-2704;;;;;;2012;;;;;;;369;376;;;;;;;;;WOS:000348533800050;;;;;;

This engine applies a competitive coevolutionary algorithm that uses the concept of Hall-of Fame to establish a long-term memory that is employed in the evaluation process. An empirical analysis of the performance of two different versions of this coevolutionary algorithm is conducted in the context of the RTS game.

The algorithms used for outlier detection are based mainly on statistics and artificial intelligence. Our long-term goal is to study and apply the principles of human vision for solving outlier detection problems. Here we present an algorithm suitable for outlier detection based on the principles of Gestalt psychology. We demonstrate the algorithm's main properties on an example taken from human perception, the recognition of continuous curves formed of Gabor patches embedded into a noisy background. We show that the algorithm is tolerant with respect to added noise and is orientation independent. As a potential application we present the problem of filtering proteomics mass spectrometry data. The true peaks within a measured mass spectrum can be represented as a graph in which nodes are fragment peaks while edges represent equivalents of proximity, similarity and continuity defined in terms of chemical rules.

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) attempt to achieve this feat by taking the class experience, as it is, online. These special types of learning courses have boomed vastly in the past year, triggered by an Artificial Intelligence course offering of Stanford fellows Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig. MOOC is different in the aspect that they generally have deadlines and provide certificates of accomplishments. Homework assignment deadlines are mostly weekly on the topics taught in a given week.

The advantages of the multi-agent approach, in conjunction with other techniques as artificial intelligence, have supported different sciences professionals to execute simulations that analyse society behaviours under different circumstances. This paper presents an analysis of the previous work generated in the field of agent-based social simulation. First, it exposes those sociological theories that have driven the use of agents and different types of models proposed. It then develops an analysis of the requirements that have the existing models and the perspectives in this field for a country like Colombia, taking into account the social work developed by the PROSOFI program in the Engineering Department of Javeriana University.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2378-8216;;978-1-4673-1476-3;;;;2012;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000395420100033;;;;;;

These models present a wide variety of techniques, most of them using novel artificial intelligence approaches. Load forecasting is a complex matter and it is the result of several processes that, depending on the database, may be of more or less importance. However, most models focus their attention only on one process like the forecasting engine, neglecting other processes like variable selection or pre-processing. This paper proposes a standard scheme for load forecasting models that includes all sub-processes within load forecasting. The analysis of load forecasting models through this scheme allows identifying the effect of each process on the overall performance of the model. Also, proposing load forecasting models following this scheme will enhance benchmarking possibilities and hybridization of models. Finally, this paper presents such analysis of an actual load forecasting model.;;;;"Gabaldon, Antonio/I-4252-2015; Aparicio, Juan/P-6348-2015; Aparicio, Juan/Z-5005-2019";"Gabaldon, Antonio/0000-0002-0952-4607; Aparicio, Juan/0000-0002-0867-0004; Aparicio, Juan/0000-0002-0867-0004";;;;;;;;;;;;2165-4077;;"978-1-4673-0832-8; 978-1-4673-0834-2";;;;2012;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000321504700088;;;;;;

The middle school teachers received professional development and mentoring from their high school peers in addition to hands-on training with their students throughout the program. The students participated in activities that explore artificial intelligence and virtual reality which in turn cultivated their interest in the science and engineering aspects of cyberspace through interactive hands-on robotics and 3-D modeling. Socratic discussions concerning the social implications of the concepts presented were explored in depth through the use of movies that directly related to artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Examples from the camp will be presented along with lessons learned. The United States faces an unprecedented challenge in foreign competition in math, science, and engineering. Locally, we face the challenge of preparing a workforce versed in cyber issues as well as math, science, and engineering to fulfill the needs of the region. The problem over the last decade is that there has been a 50% decline in the students' interest in engineering and a 14% decrease in engineering degrees with only 2.1% of high school graduates likely to earn an engineering degree. This project cultivates an interest in cyber, computer programming, math, science, and engineering by exposing middle school teachers and their students to the new technology. The Cyber Discovery model was developed through a collaboration of mathematics, science, engineering, and liberal arts faculty from Louisiana Tech University and by staff from Cyber Innovation Center. The total immersive experience was aimed at high school teachers and their student teams. The culminating week-long residential camp exposed student participants to multiple topics of cyberspace including: history of cyberspace, ethical and social issues, applications, and the need for and use of security in cyberspace. Similar to Cyber Discovery, where the focus is on building relationships between university and high school faculty; Junior Cyber Discovery is a collaboration between teams of STEM and humanities teachers at the high school and middle school levels. Junior Cyber Discovery model engages middle school students.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2153-5965;;;;;;2012;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000380252705035;;;;;;

Competitions may be internal within a single class or course, or vie school against school as regional, national, or international competitions and exist at all levels including 9-12 grades. These competitions have different formats and focuses such as vulnerability assessments, forensic challenges, offensive, and defensive competitions (or a combination of these). Some competitions require simple scripts and are considered ideal for script kitties while others require in-depth understanding of computer security and networking techniques to successfully compete in the competition While the number of competitions and students participating in them have increased, it is unclear whether the stated academic goals of the competition are being met. In some cases, it appears that the focus of the student and institutional effort is more on the competition itself than on learning underlying concepts and developing skills. At our institution, students participate in several cyber-competitions, some of which we have initiated The purpose of this paper is to survey existing cyber-competitions to understand the purpose of the competition, review underlying stated educational goals, and explore how the competition meets these goals. We compare the role of cyber competitions with the role of other computer-related competitions such as robotics, programming, unmanned aerial vehicles, and artificial intelligence comparing and contrasting the educational impact of the competitions on the participants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0190-5848;;978-1-4673-1351-3;;;;2012;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000356489200266;;;;;;

Researchers have always tried to put the human intelligence into machines by the ways of algorithms, codes or symbols that could be understood and executed by machines, thus, we may be bounded to Turing model too tightly. In Internet and World Wide Web and developing cloud computing, network has changed the role from a single huge Turing machine or sum of some Turing machines to the collective intelligence, where the inputs or outputs of nodes in network are happening not only among computers, but also among people, such that Internet has been beyond Turing machine. Users in Internet who own similar interests may cluster naturally into scalable and boundless communities with uncertainty, where online interaction avoids the difficulty of common sense representation in traditional artificial intelligence. Furthermore, collective intelligence may emerge from the crowds interaction. Those would become the new research frontiers in intelligence science.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2376-5933;;"978-1-4673-1855-6; 978-1-4673-1857-0";;;;2012;;;;;;;1171;1177;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392849600242;;;;;;

This paper presents a novel multi-sensor health diagnosis method using Deep Belief Networks (DBN). The DBN has recently become a popular approach in machine learning for its promised advantages such as fast inference and the ability to encode richer and higher order network structures. The DBN employs a hierarchical structure with multiple stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines and works through a layer by layer successive learning process. The proposed multi-sensor health diagnosis methodology using the DBN based state classification can be structured in three consecutive stages: first, defining health states and preprocessing the sensory data for DBN training and testing; second, developing DBN based classification models for the diagnosis of predefined health states; third, validating DBN classification models with testing sensory dataset. The performance of health diagnosis using DBN based health state classification is compared with support vector machine technique and demonstrated with aircraft wing structure health diagnostics and aircraft engine health diagnosis using 2008 PHM challenge data.";;;;Wang, Pingfeng/D-3764-2011;Wang, Pingfeng/0000-0002-2160-4917;;;;;;;;;;;;1095-323X;;978-1-4577-0557-1;;;;2012;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000309105303086;;;;;;

This article proposes two fairly simple and computationally feasible AMR algorithms, based on the principles of cyclostationarity and multi-fractals, suitable for practical real-time software radio communications applications for distinguishing Linear Frequency Modulation (LFM or Chirp), Pulse Width and Pulse Position Modulations (PWM/PPM) waveforms used in Radar systems, both commercial and military, from other commonly employed modulations such as, for example, BPSK, BFSK, GMSK. In these techniques, the incoming received signal is processed to determine the cyclostationary and multifractal features of the waveforms which are later matched by a neural network classifier with corresponding feature patterns of stored modulated waveforms, declaring the appropriate modulation present for whichever waveform produces the highest matching output.

The micro component concerns the fine-tuning of technical indicators with population based optimization algorithms. This entails learning a set of parameters that optimize some economically desirable fitness function as to create a dynamic signal processor which adapts to changing market environments. The macro component concerns combining the heterogeneous set of signals produced from a population of optimized technical indicators. The combined signal is derived from a Learning Classifier System (LCS) framework that combines population based optimization and reinforcement learning (RL). This research is motivated by two factors, that of non-stationarity and cyclical profitability (as implied by the adaptive market hypothesis [10]). These two properties are not necessarily in contradiction but they do highlight the need for adaptation and creation of new models, while synchronously being able to consult others which were previously effective. The results demonstrate that the proposed system is effective at combining the signals into a coherent profitable trading system but that the performance of the system is bounded by the quality of the solutions in the population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2380-8454;2640-7701;978-1-4673-1803-7;;;;2012;;;;;;;40;47;;;;;;;;;WOS:000310365100008;;;;;;

However, a proper characterization of price impacts is still lacking. This study models the price impact using an agent-based modeling approach. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether agent intelligence is a necessary condition when seeking to construct realistic price impact with an artificial market simulation. We build a zero-intelligence based artificial limit order market model. Our model distinguishes limit orders according to their order aggressiveness and takes into account some observed facts including log-normal distributed order sizes and power-law distributed limit order placements. The model is calibrated using trades and orders data from the London Stock Exchange.

Although big size data may be helpful while retrieving information, storing, processing, transmission etc., is expensive. Therefore, image compression techniques are introduced to represent the data by less bits. One of the compression techniques, wavelet transform, is used especially to compress images. By the wavelet packets decomposition, both approximation and detail coefficients of an image are extracted repeatedly up to a filtering level. In order to decompose an image by wavelet packets, there are some parameters to be set such as main wavelet type, filtering level, and threshold values at each level. Selecting the best values for these parameters affects the performance of the compression. Therefore, assigning the parameters that yield the optimum compression is a design problem. Moreover, since the filtering type and filtering level are related with the topology of the filter and the level of filtering changes the number of parameters to be optimized, the problem can be considered as a structural optimization problem. In order to solve this problem, two swarm-intelligence based optimization algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization and Artificial Bee Colony algorithms, are employed and compared in terms of compression and quality metrics.;;;;Akay, Bahriye Basturk/A-8934-2012;Akay, Bahriye Basturk/0000-0001-6575-4725;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4673-1509-8;;;;2012;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000312859300063;;;;;;

A prominent Artificial Intelligence research area is automatic programming - the generation of a computer program by another computer program. Clustering is an important data mining task with many useful real-world applications. Particularly, the class of clustering algorithms based on the idea of data density to identify clusters has many advantages, such as the ability to identify arbitrary-shape clusters. We propose the use of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms for the artificial generation of density-based clustering algorithms. In order to guarantee the generation of valid algorithms, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) was defined where each node represents a procedure (building block) and each edge represents a possible execution sequence between two nodes. The Building Blocks DAG specifies the alphabet of the EDA, that is, any possibly generated algorithm.

The idea of dividing participants into several groups is introduced to achieve budget balance in a redistribution mechanism, i.e., the payment (money) collected in one partition is distributed in another partition. Furthermore, this idea has been used to adjust parameters of a mechanism (e.g., the reservation price in an auction) based on the information of participants in one partition in order to improve the mechanism's efficiency or revenue. This paper presents a unified framework called a generalized partition mechanism, in which information, money, and unsold goods can be transferred among partitions. This framework is very general and thus can be applied to various settings, including cases where a redistribution mechanism must adjust parameters to obtain a better social surplus. We provide a sufficient condition on the flow of information, money, and goods among partitions so that the generalized partition mechanism is strategy-proof, assuming that each mechanism applied to the partition is strategy-proof. We can use this sufficient condition as a guideline for combining multiple mechanisms. To show the applicability of this guideline, we develop new redistribution mechanisms based on this guideline, in which the utility of a participant can be non-quasi-linear.;;;;Sakurai, Yuko/M-5465-2018;Sakurai, Yuko/0000-0002-0642-3878;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-0-7695-4880-7;;;;2012;;;;;;;502;509;;10.1109/WI-IAT.2012.256;;;;;;;WOS:000423016900072;;;;;;

As result of which, diagnosis of cancer especially in lungs becomes less accurate and unreliable. So, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system, based on artificial intelligence that efficiently detects nodules of any shape and size, is used for diagnosis without human intervention. In this work, we have developed a two stage CAD system in which the first stage involves pre-processing applied for a better quality image to enable higher success rate on detection following which the cancerous nodule region is segmented. The second stage involves artificial neural network (ANN) architecture which is trained using a modified BFGS algorithm. The proposed system was trained, tested, and evaluated specifically on the problem of detecting lung cancer nodules found on CT images to give a positive detection. A significant comparative analysis was done between the proposed method and several existing CAD systems used for lung nodule diagnosis and the proposed method using training-based neural networks prove to provide accuracy of 96.7% and also better specificity; thus, the overall performance of the CAD scheme was improved substantially.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2472-8438;;"978-1-4673-4634-4; 978-1-4673-4633-7";;;;2012;;;;;;;135;142;;;;;;;;;WOS:000394811900022;;;;;;

Several studies using different methods were applied to predict ROP. This importance stems from cost reducing of drilling projects. The objective of this paper is to compare the traditional multiple regression method with Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) and Radial Basis Function Network (RBF) as applied to predict ROP. ELM and RBF are artificial neural network (ANNs) techniques. ANNs are cellular systems which can acquire, store, and utilize experiential knowledge. For ELM, the activation functions, number of hidden neurons, and number of data points in the training data set are varied to find the best combination. The dataset is composed of seven input parameters. These are depth, bit weight, rotary speed, tooth wear, Reynolds number function, equivalent circulating density (ECD), and pore gradient. Prediction results found in Eren's multiple regression study are used in the comparison. The comparison is made based on field data of two different wells with no correction, then with weight on bit (WOB) vertical correction, and finally with interpolated WOB and rotary speed (RPM) motor correction. The techniques are compared in terms of training time and accuracy, and testing time and accuracy. Different input parameters of ELM and RBF give different results. The decision makers are advised, according to the results of this study, to choose ELM with sigmoidal activation function, training data = 80% and number of hidden neurons = 10 as ROP prediction technique.;;;;"Khoukhi, Amar/AAZ-7364-2020; Eren, Tuna/E-3217-2016";;;;;;;;;;;;;2473-3539;;978-0-7695-4926-2;;;;2012;;;;;;;33;38;;10.1109/EMS.2012.79;;;;;;;WOS:000392818500006;;;;;;

Moreover, various comparative studies clearly reports robust convergence of ABC algorithm than other bio-inspired optimization algorithms. Nevertheless, like other optimization algorithms, ABC suffers from slower convergence and tendency towards local optima trappings. Therefore, various amendments have been proposed to avert the flaws of ABC algorithm. Nonetheless, the variants are either computationally intensive or could not avert the flaws of the algorithms. Hence, this research work proposes an efficient variant of ABC algorithm. The proposed variant capitalizes on the global-best food-source. The proposed variant has been compared with various existing variants of ABC algorithm on a few benchmark functions. Significance of the proposed variant has also been analyzed statistically.

One of the methods is to reconfigure the traffic signal timing plan. However, dynamic characteristic of the traffic flow is not able to be resolved by the conventional traffic signal timing plan management. As a result, traffic congestion still remains as an unsolved problem. Thus, in this study, artificial intelligence algorithm has been introduced in the traffic signal timing plan to enable the traffic management systems' learning ability. Q-Learning algorithm acts as the learning mechanism for traffic light intersections to release itself from traffic congestions situation. Adjacent traffic light intersections will work independently and yet cooperate with each other to a common goal of ensuring the fluency of the traffic flows within traffic network. The experimental results show that the Q-Learning algorithm is able to learn from the dynamic traffic flow and optimized the traffic flow.;;;;"Tan, Min Keng/E-5333-2012; Tan, Min Keng/K-5286-2019";"Tan, Min Keng/0000-0003-4420-186X; Tan, Min Keng/0000-0003-4420-186X";;;;;;;;;;;;2473-3539;;978-0-7695-4926-2;;;;2012;;;;;;;343;348;;10.1109/EMS.2012.75;;;;;;;WOS:000392818500056;;;;;;

It is regarded as fifth generation (5G) mobile system. Cognitive radio research can be categorized in three parts, which are Spectrum Management, Intelligence Management and Interference Management. Spectrum management detects white space and manages different spectrum issues between primary and secondary users. Intelligence management on the other hand use different artificial intelligence techniques such as Neural Networks, Rule based system, Genetic Algorithm etc. in order to develop efficient cognitive engine. Finally Interference management focus on implementation issues of cognitive radio by dealing with channel awareness, link quality and resource allocation which mainly depend on the right choice of transmit power. This paper proposes an algorithm based on MAC scheduling techniques and uses two parallel processes to control transmit power. The first process go through different mathematical calculations of SINR, channel capacity etc of all links between different radio nodes within a network. The second process deals with environmental conditions with the help of Fuzzy logic. These both processes works together to adjust the value of transmit power of every node in order to mitigate interference and maintain QoS of the service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2157-0647;;"978-1-4673-2591-2; 978-1-4673-2589-9";;;;2012;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392696600020;;;;;;

The tests are performed on a specific simulator for mobile sensors networks and we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with the bang-bang and bang-bang improved algorithms. Finally, we highlight the improvement in speed and accuracy of the proposed algorithm by applying two metrics for comparison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"978-1-4673-0793-2; 978-1-4673-0794-9";;;;2012;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392840200125;;;;;;

Early steps towards this goal in the 1980s made clear that reasoning and human insights will not suffice. Instead, new hope has been offered by the rise of modern machine learning approaches. However, to date, it becomes increasingly clear that off-the-shelf machine learning approaches will not be adequate for robot skill learning as these methods often do not scale into the high-dimensional domains of manipulator and humanoid robotics, nor do they fulfill the real-time requirement of the domain. As an alternative, we propose to divide the generic skill learning problem into parts that can be well-understood from a robotics point of view. After designing appropriate learning approaches for these basic components, these will serve as the ingredients of a general approach to robot skill learning. In this paper, we discuss our recent and current progress in this direction. As such, we present our work on learning to control, learning elementary movements, as well as our steps towards the learning of complex tasks. We show several evaluations using both real robots as well as physically realistic simulations.;;;;"Peters, Jan/P-6027-2019; Kober, Jens/I-9119-2017";"Peters, Jan/0000-0002-5266-8091; Kober, Jens/0000-0001-7257-5434";;;;;;;;;;;;0922-6389;1879-8314;"978-1-61499-098-7; 978-1-61499-097-0";;;;2012;242;;;;;;40;45;;10.3233/978-1-61499-098-7-40;;;;;;;WOS:000349006300010;;;;;;

After exploring existing heuristic solutions as well as classical algorithms from the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL), we design an original algorithm, LSDP (Least Square Dynamic Programming), which uses simulated trajectories to solve approximately any finite-horizon MDP problem. Based on an empirical study of the behaviour of these different approaches on binary models, we derive the following conclusions: i) a naive heuristic, consisting in sampling sites where marginals are the most uncertain, is already an efficient sampling approach; ii) LSDP outperforms all the classical RL approaches we have tested; iii) LSDP outperforms the heuristic in cases when reconstruction errors have a high cost, or sampling actions are constrained.

Although learning agents are able to produce intelligent behavior with less human knowledge engineering than in the past, intelligent agent developers are still required to manually encode much prior domain knowledge. We recently proposed an efficient algorithm that acquires representations of the world using an unsupervised grammar induction algorithm, and integrated this representation learner into a simulated student, SimStudent. In this paper, we use the representation learner to automatically generate a set of feature predicates based on the acquired representation, and provide the automatically generated feature predicates to SimStudent as prior domain knowledge. We show that with the automatically-generated feature predicates, the learning agent can perform at a level comparable to when it is given manually-constructed feature predicates, but without the effort required to create these feature predicates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0922-6389;;"978-1-61499-098-7; 978-1-61499-097-0";;;;2012;242;;;;;;534;539;;10.3233/978-1-61499-098-7-534;;;;;;;WOS:000349006300092;;;;;;

Non-engineering approaches to nearness such as the abstract mathematical approach based on proximity spaces do not deal with the implementation aspects but axiomatically formalize intuitions on nearness relations and provide insights on their nature. Combining the ideas of the engineering approach with the mathematical approach of proximity spaces, we define and analyze new nearness relations that provide a good compromise between implementation needs and the need for an appropriate approximation of the natural nearness concept.;;;;;Moller, Ralf/0000-0002-1174-3323;;;;;;;;;;;;0922-6389;;"978-1-61499-098-7; 978-1-61499-097-0";;;;2012;242;;;;;;636;+;;10.3233/978-1-61499-098-7-636;;;;;;;WOS:000349006300109;;;;;;

The POMDP model deals in a single framework with both perception actions (controlling the camera's view angle), and mission actions (moving between zones and flight levels, landing) needed to achieve the goal of the mission, i. e. landing in a zone containing a car whose model is recognized as a desired target model with sufficient belief. We explain how we automatically learned the probabilistic observation POMDP model from statistical analysis of the image processing algorithm used on-board the UAV to analyze objects in the scene. We also present our optimize-while-execute framework, which drives a POMDP sub-planner to optimize and execute the POMDP policy in parallel under action duration constraints, reasoning about the future possible execution states of the robotic system.

It does this by creating simplified clones of its own behavior control structure. Secondary motivations and action preferences are linked to locations.

Training of such networks is a difficult problem that requires an effective search algorithm to find optimal weight values. While gradient-based methods, such as backpropagation, are frequently used to train multi-layer feedforward neural networks, such methods may not yield a globally optimal solution. To overcome the limitations of gradient-based methods, evolutionary algorithms have been used to train these networks with some success. This paper proposes an overlapping swarm intelligence algorithm for training neural networks in which a particle swarm is assigned to each neuron to search for that neuron's weights. Unlike similar architectures, our approach does not require a shared global network for fitness evaluation. Thus the approach discussed in this paper localizes the credit assignment process by first focusing on updating weights within local swarms and then evaluating the fitness of the particles using a localized network. This has the advantage of enabling our algorithm's learning process to be fully distributed.;;;;;"Sheppard, John/0000-0001-9487-5622; Fortier, Nathan/0000-0002-9499-0249";;;;;;;;;;;;2377-6870;;"978-1-4673-2743-5; 978-1-4673-2742-8";;;;2012;;;;;;;1420;1425;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392950200272;;;;;;

The database UBV consists of the operating variables of the furnace. These Fuzzy algorithms were used as a tool to help selecting the most adequate temperature necessary to process the patterned glass, and so reduce defects in end products. For this purpose a Model of Manufactures was used to study the process of manufacturing patterned glass. The classification obtained through the Fuzzy Decision Tree was compared with the results obtained in the manufacture of patterned glass. The classifications obtained in the manufacture and in the FID 3.4 software were also compared with the classification obtained with different algorithms, such as CART (Classification and Regression Tree) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2377-6870;;"978-1-4673-2743-5; 978-1-4673-2742-8";;;;2012;;;;;;;1643;1648;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392950200313;;;;;;

Nowadays, NAOC is the headquarters of the Regional Warning Center of China (RWC-China), which is one of the members of the International Space Environment Service (ISES). NAOC is responsible for exchanging data, information and space weather forecasts of RWC-China with other RWCs. The solar weather forecasting services at NAOC cover short-term prediction (within two or three days), medium-term prediction (within several weeks), and long-term prediction (in time scale of solar cycle) of solar activities. Most efforts of the short-term prediction research are concentrated on the solar eruptive phenomena, such as flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar proton events, which are the key driving sources of strong space weather disturbances. Based on the high quality observation data of the latest space-based and ground-based solar telescopes and with the help of artificial intelligence techniques, new numerical models with quantitative analyses and physical consideration are being developed for the predictions of solar eruptive events. The 3-D computer simulation technology is being introduced for the operational solar weather service platform to visualize the monitoring of solar activities, the running of the prediction models, as well as the presenting of the forecasting results. A new generation operational solar weather monitoring and forecasting system is expected to be constructed in the near future at NAOC.;;;;He, Han/M-2136-2014;"He, Han/0000-0001-9352-9189; Zhang, Liyun/0000-0003-3959-6895";;;;;;;;;;;;;;"978-981-4405-74-4; 978-981-4405-73-7";;;;2012;;;;;;;117;126;;;;;;;;;WOS:000345700300008;;;;;;

However, dynamic and unpredictable topology has great influence on the successful completion of military tasks. As one of the most important performance measures of Tactical Internet (TI), reliability (the capacity of communication during movement) will be expected. To ensure reliability is achieved, this work describes the unique characteristics of TI, such as tactical intention, the fuzziness of upper-level intention and the randomness of lower-level mobility patterns. Cloud Model from Artificial Intelligence with Uncertainty is imported as a key algorithm to deal with the mobility model. The new methods adapt to cloudy-mobility model by treating the configuration probabilistically. Then presents a new method for approximating the wireless link and TI's reliability, which is transmission distance and capacity constrained. Thus, this paper expands upon these works by modifying the problem formulation to utilize a Monte Carlo simulation technique for the reliability analysis of a cloudy-mobility-based TI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"978-0-203-13510-5; 978-0-415-68379-1";;;;2012;;;;;;;2662;2668;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392426504022;;;;;;

Such processes, applied by immune systems trying to protect organisms from biologically and biochemically hazardous entities, intensely increase the learning performance and accuracy of Multi-Layer Perceptrons performing a stochastic search in a space. This is achieved by applying a combination of immunological operations in each population ' s evolution cycle, which are clonal selection and somatic hypermutation, negative selection and danger theory. Furthermore, causality plays an important role within the introduced paradigm, as the solution population does not only change from generation to generation, but also within each generation. For the immune system-based operations only the individuals of the current generation do matter. Thus, the in-and outputs a population in consideration processes when learning admittedly have a significance over time for the genetic evolution of a single individual (chromosome). However, all of the immune systembased operations do not need to consider these, as only the current population of genomes matters.

Our case study is focused on applying artificial intelligence techniques to support scientists working on bio-nutritional trials, which rely on the study of the effect of consuming food with biomarkers on human health. This work is developed under the HENUFOOD2 project. In order to simplify the domain, two trial stages are considered: the trial experimental execution and the trial data analysis. It is after the trial has been executed and all the information collected, when we try to discover non obvious knowledge among the trial data and support the scientists on their everyday analytical tasks. On the one hand, this analysis includes generic statistical manipulation and data discovery empowered by data mining techniques. On the other hand, a scientist support engine has been developed in order to allow non data manipulation and analysis experts to access the information and ask for new analysis processes. The approach, thanks to a user friendly interface enabled with query answering techniques, is able to interact with the user in a conversational mode and run analytical or data discovery processes, do a semantic search on previous indexed works or, finally, infer new rules to feed the expert system ontology.

Currently, building automation controls commercial and residential buildings to try to satisfy energy saving goals. However, the use of this kind of systems does not assure an optimal energy behavior. An intelligent energy management approach based on Artificial Intelligence techniques arise as a most advantageous solution to improve the benefits provided for new control systems. This paper describes an approach, developed under the EU project called KnoHolEM(2), to elaborate a Knowledge based Intelligent Building Energy Management system. The main goal is to include an intelligent energy management strategy with focus on the behavior of building users. The proposed approach uses the building occupant's activities, the inter-dependency and interaction between building facilities and users, and the building infrastructure as a basis to improve the building energy usage. All of the collected information is managed by a knowledge base. This knowledge base is supported by data mining algorithms, focused on enhancing ontology rules by pattern and anomaly detection, and a distributed intelligent architecture.

Emergence seems to have become a magic solution (or at least apparent solution) of many old problems. The article aims to answer the question why we do discuss emergence in relation to connectionist paradigm (not only in artificial intelligence), or in other words whether it is appropriate to talk about connectionism as about cradle and breeding ground for a new concept of emergence as it is usual. The contribution argues that this view is inaccurate, what's more it leads to a paradox that will be also outlined in the paper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-80-261-0102-4;;;;2012;;;;;;;130;137;;;;;;;;;WOS:000393059500012;;;;;;

This paper presents a dynamic adaptive algorithm selection framework for online trading with the goal of maximizing overall revenue (lower competitive ratio). We integrate the algorithm selection ([ 1]) and probabilistic graphs to transform the algorithm selection model of offline algorithms for a dynamically adaptive model of online trading. Unlike the traditional static approach of algorithm selection, where a single algorithm is executed over the whole investment horizon, we dynamically select and update the trading algorithm by analyzing the time series features. The time series is partitioned in different windows and each window's features are extracted sequentially using real time hybrid pattern matching approach. The extracted features of current window w(i) are analyzed and the decision making module determines the best suitable algorithm for next window w(i+1) on the basis of underlying probabilistic graphical model. The process is repeated until all windows in a time series are processed. Our dynamic adaptive algorithm selection model outperforms the static model on real world datasets of DAX30 and S&P500.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1865-1348;;"978-3-642-30359-3; 978-3-642-30358-6";;;;2012;117;;;;;;236;248;;;;;;;;;WOS:000345321800021;;;;;;

Currently, the web requires new forms of learning and knowledge; with the globalization of information, connectivity and virtuality have a bearing on human thought. Digital thinking is shaping our reality and its organizational form. Natural memory, considered to be a process that requires the structure of natural language and human capabilities, is interwoven with a subject and a conscience; memory preserved through writing required other tools to assist it, and classifications, cataloguing, organization or other KOS were created. The new tool for recovering digital memory is the semantic web. This points to information's future on the Internet and seems to approach the utopia of global, organized information and attempts to give the website greater significance. The Web 3.0 incorporates a proliferation of languages, concepts and tools that are difficult to govern and are created by users. The semantic web seems to be a natural evolution of the participative web in which we find ourselves, and if an effective combination is achieved between the inclusion of semantic content in web pages and the use of artificial intelligence it will be a revolution; semantic codification will be a fact when it is totally automated. Based on this, a collective digital intelligence is being constituted. We find ourselves before intelligent multitudes with broad access to enormous amounts of information. The intelligent multitude emerges when technologies interconnect. In this global interconnection of semantic information an exponential pattern of technological growth can take place.";;;;Martinez-Avila, Daniel/H-8349-2016;Martinez-Avila, Daniel/0000-0003-2236-553X;;;;;;;;;;;;0938-5495;;978-3-89913-902-0;;;;2012;13;;;;;;206;211;;;;;;;;;WOS:000342292200032;;;;;;

However, keywords may not be sufficiently representative for the main topic of a web page. When searching for a topic, users input their desirable topic in terms of keywords. Keyword-based search engines will return pages that contain the keywords even though these pages are not about the topic. This limits the efficiency of these engines as they may return undesirable result. In this paper, we present an approach to improve the quality of search engines by focusing on web pages related to specific topics. Our system includes three main components: a crawler for gathering web pages, a classifier for classifying web pages by topics, and a hyperlink filter (or distiller) for filtering hyperlinks. We propose Naive Bayes algorithms for classifier and distiller to enhance the accuracy of the system. We also implement and examine the efficiency of our system by gathering web pages in two topics: Artificial Intelligence and Motorcycle. The result shows that our crawler achieves performance improvements in efficiency over the ones that search by keywords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;;978-3-642-34630-9;;;;2012;7653;;;;;;525;535;;;;;;;;;WOS:000340573000054;;;;;;

We propose to employ abstract argumentation for this purpose. Specifically, we present a translation of action domains from a specification language into Dung-style argumentation frameworks (AFs). As the key advantage of our approach, we use existing semantics for argumentation to make predictions about the domain in various manners and utilise existing results about argumentation to show that the approach can be efficiently implemented. This demonstrates the practical value not only of its theoretical results, but also abstract argumentation itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0922-6389;;"978-1-61499-111-3; 978-1-61499-110-6";;;;2012;245;;;;;;297;309;;10.3233/978-1-61499-111-3-297;;;;;;;WOS:000349004000029;;;;;;

Logic Comput. 13, 2003), which has been established as a fruitful model to study abstract argumentation systems. It takes into account the relative importance among arguments which reflects the value system of an audience. The central issue in the study of VAFs is the decision problems of subjective acceptance and objective acceptance: an argument is subjectively (objectively, resp.) accepted if it is accepted with respect to one audience (all possible audiences, resp.) An important limitation for using VAFs in real-world applications is the computational intractability of the acceptance problems. We identify nontrivial classes in terms of structural restrictions on the underlying graph structure of VAFs and present a polynomial-time algorithm in the spirit of dynamic programming. We supplement the tractability by the hardness result. This extends and generalize the results of Dunne (COMMA 2010) and Kim et al.

The progress of medical diagnosis using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used for the treatment of neurological diseases; it allows obtaining, increasingly, more functional and anatomical information from the brain of the patients, with a great precision in time and space. However, this big amount of data and images are impossible to analyze directly, is necessary to develop methodologies of calculus for quantified the parameters more relevant in the MRI. This work proposes a methodology for the diagnosis of dementia based on Alzheimer's disease combining imaging processing and artificial intelligence techniques. We created an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) of classification based on architecture Multilayer Perceptron. In order to construct a complete dataset for training and testing of the network, initial inputs-target variables were obtained from the database OASIS (Open Access Series of imaging studies) with a total of instances equal to 235. The variables were classified into 3 groups: demographic, clinical and morphometric data. Task of training and testing were applied on initial data, obtained a 48% of confusion of the diagnosis. For minimize this percentages of error, image processing and Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) techniques were implemented to obtain new morphometric variables of three areas of the brain: White Matter (WM), Gray Matter (GM) and fluid (CSF) cerebro-espinal. In this way, we reduced the percentage of confusion to 17%. The results obtained with the ANN, demonstrated that the demographic and clinical information from patients, combined with morphometric information of areas of the brain, are input variables useful to train an ANN of diagnosis of dementia with 83% of reliability, and in this way, help to the early diagnosis of AD.";;;;Soudah, Eduardo/J-4429-2012;"Soudah, Eduardo/0000-0002-2301-4718; Gavidia, Giovana/0000-0002-5743-1800";;;;;;;;;;;;;;"978-0-203-12818-3; 978-0-415-68395-1";;;;2012;;;;;;;51;55;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392382300011;;;;;;

All the algorithms are based on the application of artificial neural networks to the hyperspectral data. In the first algorithm the neural networks are applied at the level of individual pixels of the image. The second algorithm is a multiresolution based approach to scale invariant target identification using a hierarchical artificial neural network architecture. The third algorithm is a refinement of the previous one but including also the ability to detect the orientation of the targets in cases for which this information is relevant. We have studied the main issues for the efficient implementation of the algorithms in GPU: the exploitation of thousands of threads that are available in this architecture and the adequate use of bandwidth of the device. The tests we have performed show both the effectiveness of detection of the algorithms and the efficiency of the GPU implementation in terms of execution times and bandwidth usage.

These would include factors such as the student's learning style, motivation for learning, decisions about relevant learning resources and consequently, dynamics of learning and teaching. Many of mentioned factors are inter-correlated and recent research is mostly focused on retrieval of relevant learning materials adaptive to the capabilities of learner and available resources. The adaptive e-learning system is typically presented with a block diagram, which consists of the domain ontology, student model, adaptive retrieval module and the learning object repository. Student model is seen as an abstract entity and the student profile represents an instantiation of the student model for a particular user. It integrates his/her personal preferences and in the literature, many different strategies are adopted for providing the personalized information. The adaptivity of such systems are mainly focused on allocation of available resources based on general requirements, about further and additional learning of segments of lectures that student previously did not adequately learn and understand.* In this paper we put the attention on the teachers who define different kinds of requirements describing the conditions and circumstances which the selection of appropriate learning resources depends on. They may integrate a variety of different information and characteristics, contained either in a student model, or even in any other part of a system (e. g. environmental characteristics such as time features, etc). For example, teacher may define requirement in the form: if a student did not successfully master the previous lectures and there is only few days left to the exam, student should be concentrated on the basic concepts of the whole course. Otherwise, if there is more time for preparation, basic concepts with additional practical exercises should be dedicated to the student. These conditional requirements define the recommendation of resources dynamically in relation to the most characteristics of student model on one side, and available resources, on another. More precisely, even if the teacher defines requirements about the most suitable plan of learning guidance, the second phase includes findings of the most appropriate learning resources related to teachers' requirements and potentially defined students' preferences in his profile. Thus, the elicitation and processing of such requirements enable dynamical construction of learning resources adaptive to the students, available resources and learning environment characteristics. The representation of preferences and its processing has been studied in many fields such as economics, especially in project and risk management, decision theory, social choice theory, with further developments and applications in areas such as operational research, databases, security analysis, and artificial intelligence. The main goal of this paper is to analyze the possibilities of their integration in the learning environment for the both participants in the learning process, i.e. students and teachers. The availability of automated analyzes of defined requirements allows for more subtle personalization and dynamically allocated higher quality recommendation.;;;;Sendelj, Ramo/AAN-2533-2020;Sendelj, Ramo/0000-0002-9973-6426;;;;;;;;;;;;2340-1117;;978-84-695-3491-5;;;;2012;;;;;;;2252;2261;;;;;;;;;WOS:000326239302047;;;;;;

It uses a concept of digital damage fingerprints (DDFs) extracted from scattered wave signals, which are the input for training of artificial neural network. The trained neural network was used for inverse assessment of the damage, and the algorithm was validated by experiments with actual damage introduced in aluminum plates and laminate composite beams or plates, where DDFs were extracted from networks of piezoelectric elements (PZT) attached to the surface of the structures for activating and capturing of guided ultrasonic wave signals. The results predicted by the algorithm show good accuracy in defining damage parameters, such as central position, size, orientation etc., for cracks and delamination in the structures.;;;;SU, Zhongqing/G-9560-2015;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-7-5628-3389-5;;;;2012;;;;;;;35;42;;;;;;;;;WOS:000393849100005;;;;;;

However, this tendency leaves aside key issues, namely the context information that was previously available in traditional Alternative Dispute Resolution processes. The main weakness of this approach is that conflict resolution may become focused solely on objective issues. In order to overcome this inconvenience, we move forward to incorporate context and behavioural information in an Online Dispute Resolution platform. In particular, we consider the estimation of the level of stress and the prediction of the stress state evolution. As a result, the conflict resolution platform or the mediator may predict to what extent a party is affected by a particular matter, allowing one to adapt the conflict resolution strategy to a specific scenario in real time.;;;;"Novais, Paulo/M-4053-2013; NEVES, JOSE/M-4203-2013; Carneiro, Davide/A-3490-2014; Gomes, Marco/M-9101-2016";"Novais, Paulo/0000-0002-3549-0754; NEVES, JOSE/0000-0002-8863-0351; Carneiro, Davide/0000-0002-6650-0388; Gomes, Marco/0000-0001-6370-9955";;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-642-28941-5; 978-3-642-28942-2";;;;2012;7208;;;;;;533;544;;;;;;;;;WOS:000309166900048;;;;;;

Search on dynamic graphs, i.e. graphs that can change their layout while searching, receives plenty of attention today - mostly in the planning domain. Approaches often assume global knowledge on the dynamic graph, i.e. that topology and dynamic operations are known to the algorithm. There exist use-cases however, where this assumption cannot be made. In vehicular ad-hoc networks, for example, a vehicle is only able to recognize the topology of the graph within wireless network transmission range. In this paper, we propose a combined uniform and heuristic search algorithm, which maintains shortest paths in highly dynamic graphs under the premise that graph operations are not globally known.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-989-8425-95-9;;;;2012;;;;;;;119;126;;10.5220/0003742401190126;;;;;;;WOS:000327208400013;;;;;;

Temporal information is presented to the user as anchored time intervals with optional beginning and end dates. The model accounts for both instants and intervals, and can be applied to uncertain dates by leaving days and months optional, or by using symbolic constraints that present additional time granularities. The model is defined using conventional relational database structures to support ease of deployment and integration to legacy systems with efficient query capabilities. The model is based on experiences with an existing museum database and highlights challenges related to temporal representation of cultural-historical data in practice. The model is compared with temporal representations used in other museum information systems and collections management standards.

Artificial intelligence involves two basic ideas[4]. First, it involves studying the thought processes of human beings. Second, it deals with representing those processes via machines (like computers, robots, etc.). AI is behavior of a machine, which, if performed by a human being, would be called intelligent. It makes machines smarter and more useful, and is less expensive than natural intelligence. Othello is one example of game playing using AI. Even though it may appear as though Othello is a fairly simple game, there still are many important aspects of the game to consider. The most important of these are the evaluation function and searching algorithms. Why are these important? First of all, the game would be nothing without an evaluation function. And there are many interesting aspects of the evaluation which can greatly affect both efficiency as well as game play. Second, a good searching algorithm can fulfill the ideal properties of a good heuristic, providing a good answer in a reasonable amount of time.

This paper focuses on developing artificial intelligence tool to diagnose Keratoconus. This tool can help manufactures in improving their devices to assist experts and improves the Keratoconus recognition phase either automatically or by expert. Our Artificial intelligence algorithm finds Keratoconus by employing features of topographical map of eye. These features are obtained by Pentacam and extracted by topographical images of eye via image processing techniques. We provide a dataset of the topographical images of eye by Pentacam in about six months and experts provide labels explaining if the images show sign of Keratoconus or they are suspect to keratoconus. This paper employs 82 topography maps of eye from dataset and classifies them into two categories: Normal (n=47) and Keratoconus (n=35). We use 12 features of each map as the input of a classifier. These classifiers are artificial Neural Network (NN) including MultiLayer-Perceptron, RBFNN, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree. These classifiers are trained to detect Keratoconus or suspect to Keratoconus by part of dataset images and they are tested by the rest. The final result shows that we can detect Keratoconus, suspect to Keratoconus and normal eye by the proposed algorithm with about 91 percents accuracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2078-0958;;978-988-19251-1-4;;;;2012;;;;;;;89;91;;;;;;;;;WOS:000396916800018;;;;;;

However, underlying this evolution, there are processes that cannot be easily captured through the use of simple methods/statistical tools. Nevertheless, thanks to the emergence in the past few decades of artificial intelligence based models such as cellular automata and neural network models, this paper proposes to simulate future spatial evolution in Luxembourg and the Greater region up to 2020.

The proposed architecture is expected to produce an optimum control gains in both pitch and yaw responses by introducing decoupling function between pitch and yaw responses. The internal change corresponds to coupling effects, gust and wind turbulence are very difficult to compensate by the classical PID control, but both of them are stamped out as AFC scheme is implemented into the control strategy. The performance of TRMS is further optimized by the realization of hybrid strategy in which an artificial intelligence Fuzzy Logic is integrated into the control architecture. (C) 2012 The Authors.

The situated and embodied view of cognition rejects the notion that intelligence could arise in a closed 'brain-in-a-vat' system, because intelligence is rooted in a high-bandwidth, sensory-motor interaction with the outside world. Instead, it is proposed that superhuman intelligence can emerge only in a distributed fashion, in the form of a self-organizing network of humans, computers, and other technologies: the 'Global Brain'.;;;;Heylighen, Francis/B-8048-2009;Heylighen, Francis/0000-0001-5823-5898;;;;;;;;;;;;1355-8250;;;;;JAN-FEB;2012;19;1-2;;;SI;;126;142;;;;;;;;;WOS:000319627600008;;;;;;

Therefore, there is a growing need for automated tools for obtaining valuable information from these raw data in different data warehouses. Data Mining represents the process of extracting valuable and useful knowledge from large amounts of data. Generating appropriate abstractions from these distributed data warehouses is a challenging task for data mining tools. Data mining is a multidisciplinary research area and it includes database technology, neural networks, artificial intelligence and machine learning etc. It enables valuable information to the end users. However, if the system is newly set and it is in the cold start position with no or little processed data, this influences the system efficiency.

To prevent premature convergence and degeneration phenomenon, this paper proposes a new optimization computation approach, human-simulated immune evolutionary algorithm (HSIEA). Considering that the premature convergence problem is due to the lack of diversity in the population, the HSIEA employs the clonal selection principle of artificial immune system theory to preserve the diversity of solutions for the search process. Mathematical descriptions and procedures of the HSIEA are given, and four new evolutionary operators are formulated which are clone, variation, recombination, and selection. Two benchmark optimization functions are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HSIEA.;;;;peng, chen/L-7111-2019;"Tian, Yu-Chu/0000-0002-8709-5625; Tang, Maolin/0000-0002-2416-4101";;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;978-3-642-34487-9;;;;2012;7665;;;;;;92;99;;;;;;;;;WOS:000345089800012;;;;;;

The doctor regularly uses a temporal recording of ECG and waveforms characteristics to study and diagnose the overall heart functioning. In some heart diseases, the correct diagnosis in an early time is essential for the patient survival. This need leads to the necessity to automate normal beat signals discrimination from abnormal beat signals. In our study, we have chosen the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) as a classifier for this type of signals into two categories: normal (N) and pathological (V).

However, this method is seldom used for hyperspectral image classification due to its complexity. To address this problem, a class-specific model based on AIRS, named as Single Class Learning Network AIRS (SCLN-AIRS), is proposed in this paper to improve the classification accuracy for hyperspectral images compared with AIRS based method. For SCLN-AIRS, the outliers of training samples from irrelevant classes are ignored first. Then, a novel MC evolution strategy is proposed to prevent memory cells being affected by other ones from different classes. In the novel model, the calculation complexity is guaranteed by the fact that the class is expressed only by few memory cells while classification result is improved.

The target is that animation information of mobile phone message is extracted and 3D animation is generated automatically under computer aided and sent to the receiver of message. Motion planning is one of the core modules in mobile phone 3D animation auto-generation system. In this thesis , we build action's ontology using semantic web technology. Firstly, motion planning module uses topic and action atoms extracted from message to reasoning the corresponding action. Secondly, it processes the capture data of action using motion editing technology according to the animation scenes selected in plot planning.

The already introduced, computationally intelligent Data Mining system System applying High Order Computational Intelligence in Data Mining (SHOCID) applies such for Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learning by the combination of one of its learning approaches with a host organism, serving as genetic pool, and transgenetic vectors. The application of an algorithm combining horizontal gene transfer between a host and a symbiont is a completely new ANN learning approach, which increases both learning performance and accuracy to a considerable degree. A further advantage is that the application of transgenetic vectors massively increases the chance of reaching the desired stopping criteria (like a minimum Root Mean Squared Error [RMSE]) instead of abort criteria (like the evolutionary stop after 5,000 generations without improvement although the desired have not been fulfilled), as even learning algorithms like back propagation cannot oscillate or get stuck in local minima due to the inescapable transfer of host genetic material.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1842-0133;;;;;;2012;;;;;;;1120;1125;;;;;;;;;WOS:000398866700167;;;;;;

Intelligence-led counterterrorism framework based on data mining can be divided into four function modules: data storage, data pretreatment, data analysis and data visualization processor. The data mining process of counterterrorism's information analysis includes problem identification of counterterrorism, data preparation, data mining, model assessment and knowledge representation. Bayesian Belief Network is a very useful tool for data mining in intelligence-led counterterrorism. Terrorists more or less will leave the corresponding clues in premeditated, planning and implementing crime. However, it is harder than looking for a needle in a bottle of hay to use the existing technology and method to extract the anti-terrorist information from the clues! Because this kind of terrorism information which is covered in the magnitude of the general information is indefinite and unknown in time series and space. The traditional database retrieval system cannot respond to this inquiry. Artificial identification, mutatis mutandis, monitoring technology and the implementation of known goal detection all need lots of manpower, and it is powerless to search unknown target in voluminous information.

Yet, these services are really fragmented and, in some cases, lack critical mass to become useful tools for the scientific community. Furthermore, most of them have failed to create a virtual environment where users' needs and activities are supported. In this paper, we present an entity-based platform aimed at integrating papers, persons, events and the services they enable. Conferences (events) are used as a starting point for collecting a critical mass of users: upon registration attendees become part of the community and can contribute to it, discussing publications, sharing content (e. g. presentations, videos, notes and pictures), or adding additional information on their page.

A well-known technique is data mining and pattern recognition, which are disciplines dependent of artificial intelligence that from some data, allow the acquisition of knowledge and in particular, within data mining, a great application in the field of bioinformatics has been found. What is more, the big and diverse expansion of the amount of data produced by problems related to biological behavior has generated the necessity of constructing precise algorithms of prediction and classification. The precision of classification algorithms can be affected by diverse factors, some of them considered generics in any automatic learning algorithm and, therefore, applicable to the distinct research areas. These factors are the ones that have received attention in the field of automatic learning and pattern recognition, where different clustering algorithms are observed, in particular the automatic classification or better known as classification by partitions. In this scenery, is important to discover an analogy about the way that some living beings form groups to survive in their environment finding an optimal sequence or structure or, that group their objects or belongings, against a classification by partitions algorithm. The partitioning is an NP-hard problem, thus the incorporation of approximated methods is necessary. The heuristic that we expose here is Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) focusing in the way that this heuristic does the search of neighbor conditions by means of neighborhoods to get a satisfactory solution, just like some living beings usually do it when they try to adapt to a neighborhood close to theirs or to the current space. In this work, we focus on describing in a bioinspired way, a technique of data mining known as partitional grouping with the inclusion of VNS with the purpose of finding approximated solutions for a clustering problem.;;;;Olivares-Benitez, Elias/R-7075-2018;"Olivares-Benitez, Elias/0000-0001-7943-3869; Bernabe Loranca, Maria Beatriz/0000-0003-3014-4139";;;;;;;;;;;;2164-7364;;978-1-4673-4768-6;;;;2012;;;;;;;150;155;;;;;;;;;WOS:000332794600024;;;;;;

Evidence shows that these two processes interact extensively in the human brain. In fields such as human-computer interactions and artificial intelligence, computational models of attention and emotions have been developed to be included in cognitive agent architectures. However, these have been implemented as two separated processes. Although this strategy has allowed the development of intelligent agents capable of showing very believable behavior, the modeling of the interactions between the attention and emotion processes has been widely ignored. In this paper, we propose a biologically inspired computational model of emotional attention.

This is particularly evident in the developments apparent in the ongoing 'Deconstructing Duchamp' project, where 'flocking' behaviours have been applied to Duchampian digitised items to observe the familial relations within, and key to his work, at play. Following this project, a second work 'Shift-Life' has proceeded to further develop the idea of allotting animal-like behaviours to electronic data items giving them the appearance of possessing a basic intelligence. By then observing their response to our physical interactions we can glean a clearer understanding, from their interrelationships, of a complex conceptual framework. While Marcel Duchamp offered the art world one of the most complex and formative pieces of art ever, initiating the shift of values from aesthetics to idea, Charles Darwin developed the theory of evolution, the 'big' idea of survivability through adaptation. Shift-Life was created as part of the national Darwin 200 project for the international bicentenary in 2009. It is a complex system of virtual life-forms struggling to survive in an environment made volatile through human interaction. Central to this installation work is the artificial life ecosystem as a self-sustaining, self-reproducing equilibrium of creatures and plants living in it. The general behaviour of each organism was more sophisticated than for the Duchampian creatures in that they were equipped for survival strategies and the reproduction of progenies. An exposition of the Shift-Life program is therefore presented followed by reflection on both projects and future directions for this collaborative research where potential emergent behaviours are concerned.;;;;Chng, Eugene/Q-8277-2019;"Chng, Eugene/0000-0003-3992-8335; Harrison, Dew/0000-0003-4002-0113";;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-0-7695-4814-2;;;;2012;;;;;;;290;295;;10.1109/CW.2012.49;;;;;;;WOS:000341886500044;;;;;;

Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a famous combinatorial optimization problem which has been used in many fields such as network communication, transportation, manufacturing and logistics. However, it requires a considerably large amount of computational time and resources for solving TSP. To dealing with this problem, we present a Parallel Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (PABCA) in several computers which operation system is Linux based on the Message Passing Interface (MPI). The entire artificial bee colony is divided into several subgroups by PABCA equally. Each subgroup performs an ABCA for TSP on each processor node, respectively. Each sub-colony on every processor node communicates the current best fitness function and parameters of current best fitness function according to ring topological structure during calculation process. Some well-known benchmark problems in TSP are used to evaluate the performance of ABCA and PABCA. Meanwhile, the performance of PABCA is compared with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Experimental results show that the PABCA can obtain solutions with equal precision and reduce the time of computation obviously in comparison with serial ABCA. And PABCA have much better performance in contrast with GA and PSO.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-94-91216-41-1;;;;2012;;;;;;;663;667;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392928800160;;;;;;

A major challenge exists in team overall performance optimization because there are a large number of uncertainties in agents' complex processes of interactions. In our previous work, we have found that a small change of a parameter may influence the performance significantly. On the other hand, existing researches of large-scale multi-agent coordination algorithm only proved the evidences by simply comparing with the non-intelligent coordination method, where a general simulation platform is required that can abstract the details of environment but is able to simulate the complex coordination activities for each agent. In this paper, we have designed such a general platform for large-scale multi-agent team coordination. This platform is able to simulate a variety of tasks that are imperative to agents' team coordination. In addition, by varying the setting of giving team coordination parameters as well as loading different coordination strategies, it is capable of simulating and evaluating system performance according to different properties and provides the clue on building optimization algorithms in future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2161-2927;;978-988-15638-1-1;;;;2012;;;;;;;6467;6471;;;;;;;;;WOS:000393905906103;;;;;;

Fuzzy logic can assist in this endeavor because political science is largely subjective and often demands the use of uncertain terms in describing events in international relations. Such an index would be a beneficial reference tool for individuals in the political arena. For politicians trying to gain a deeper understanding of global issues, knowledge of the impact and function of the relevant governments is essential. In an internal conflict, the rankings within this study may provide insight into the motivations and reasons for the contention. They could even possibly be used to predict controversies, such as when the freedoms that a government advertises or that the people want do not match the reality within a state. States striving for democracy would also be able to see areas where improvement is needed or to make sure that efforts to progress are having effect. Overall, this paper proposes a useful application of fuzzy logic for grading democratization within countries based on expert knowledge and the political histories of a variety of states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4503-1203-5;;;;2012;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000395791900014;;;;;;

There is a growing interest in an offshoot of the basic idea of machine intelligence called socially intelligent computing, which is not focused on independent machine intelligence, but on how systems that involve machines and people through different forms of interactions create new types of intelligent systems. Today's entering college freshman are often already experienced with collaborative technologies and social computing systems, so it makes sense to consider introducing topics on socially intelligent computing in introductory computer science courses. This is because there is a clear connection between social computing and socially intelligent computing, and these topics might also provide some students with a new incentive to consider pursuing formal study in computer science. In this paper, a framework is presented for teaching socially intelligent computing principles at the level of an introductory Computer Science course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4503-1203-5;;;;2012;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000395791900027;;;;;;

The actual practice of designing is applying a combination of scientific principles and making decisions based on experimental knowledge. Visualization of calculation results is useful at any stage of the design process. What is nice to look at, is usually constructively right - a known Estonian engineer and designer of bridges, prof. Otto-mar Maddison, once said. This applies to contemporary design process as well - a lot of elements and parts of drawings are often designed using estimation by sight. On the other hand, designing is often based on approximate calculations like it is usual in the conceptual design. Developing and using problem solvers for design has been a scientific activity in Institute of Cybernetics at Tallinn University of Technology for a long time. Several solver based software environments have been developed. Quite well-known environments from last decades ExpertPRIZ and NUT are simple to learn and they perform automatic calculations in different fields of engineering. A new system CoCoViLa -Compiler Compiler for Visual Languages - has been under development for the last five years. In recent years, the authors have prepared some experimental CAD packages with artificial intelligence features for automatic calculations of machine elements like gear drives, shafts, bearings, belt drives, fits and tolerances. These packages are helpful especially at a conceptual design stage to find standard parameters from tables and to visualize the results. Some examples of using these systems in conceptual design of machine elements are introduced.;;;;Kalja, Ahto/I-3267-2015;Kalja, Ahto/0000-0001-6416-0503;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-9949-23-265-9;;;;2012;;;;;;;357;360;;;;;;;;;WOS:000392535600058;;;;;;

Mechatronics means the close interaction of mechanics, electronics, control engineering and software engineering in order to achieve a better systems behavior. Due to the outstanding deployment of information and communication technologies, the functionality of mechatronic systems will go far beyond the known standards with the intention to increase their robustness, flexibility and reliability. The objective is to develop intelligent systems that react autonomously on changing environmental conditions and optimize their behavior during operation. The design of such advanced mechatronic systems is a challenge. Additionally to mechanical, electrical, control and software engineers also expertise from mathematical optimization, artificial intelligence and even cognitive science is necessary. This requires an effective and continuous cooperation and communication between developers from different domains during the whole development process. As a consequence a domain-spanning methodology is necessary in order to guarantee an effective work flow between the participating developers from various domains and their domain-specific methods, terminologies and solutions. For this purpose an ontology-based computer support will be presented, that facilitates the systems engineer by analyzing the functional system model and identifying convenient solutions.

A new hierarchical learning architecture based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and reinforcement learning (RL) is considered utilizing the information of the system interactions with the environment or situation awareness. The situation information is represented in form of a reinforcement signal generated by a reference module within the framework of the adaptive critic design (ACD). The action and critic modules in ACD are generally implemented using traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP) type artificial neural networks (ANN). In this paper, an alternative form of ANN, namely, single multiplicative neuron (SMN) model is considered in place of MLP for representing action, critic and reference modules. The network modules are trained using a variation of particle swarm optimization.

This is because it is likely that the combustion will become increasingly unstable as the biomass proportion increases. In order to develop a flame monitoring and control system, flame signal data sets were collected from combustion measurements taken on a 500kW pilot scale combustion test facility. The sensors used were photodiodes with sensitivities in the UV, visible and IR wavelengths. The analysis of these data, identified flame features that can be related to operational parameters such as flame stability, excess air level, NOx and CO emissions. These features were then applied in the development of an intelligent flame monitoring and optimisation system for individual burners based on these low cost sensors.

Decisions made during this phase can have a significant impact on product cost, quality and build time; therefore, it is important that process planners have intuitive tools to aid them in effectively creating process plans. However, in spite of being a strong research area, the actual application of CAPP systems in industry is limited and new modem 3D digital tools in this area have not been researched to any real degree. Traditional process planning is carried out either manually or via a CAPP interface and, from this activity, a set of instructions are generated for the shop floor. However, these CAPP processes can be time consuming and subject to inconsistencies. Current research seeks to automate the generation of work instructions by using previous designs and/or artificial intelligence. However, due to the complexity of manufacturing a wide range of products, the limited range of tools available and differing skills of the workforce, it is difficult to reach a generic solution for practical application. The novel pilot study given in this paper presents one of the first pieces of research comparing and contrasting a traditional manual approach to machined part process planning with an alternative haptic virtual environment. Within this, an operator can simulate the machining of a simple part using a virtual drilling and milling process via a haptic routing interface. All of the operator input is logged in the background with the system automatically generating shop floor instructions from this log file. Findings show that users found the virtual system to be more intuitive and required less mental workload than traditional manual methods. Also their perceptions for the future were that they would need less support for learning and would progress to final planning solutions more quickly.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-0-7918-4501-1;;;;2012;;;;;;;231;236;;;;;;;;;WOS:000335932700027;;;;;;

Successful health diagnostics requires the knowledge of system failures. However, with an increasing complexity it is extraordinarily difficult to have a well-tested system so that all potential faulty states can be realized and studied at product testing stage. Thus, real time health diagnostics requires automatic detection of unexampled faulty states through the sensory signals to avoid sudden catastrophic system failures. This paper presents a hybrid inference approach (MA) for structural health diagnosis with unexampled faulty states, which employs a two-fold inference process comprising of preliminary statistical learning based anomaly detection and artificial intelligence based health state classification for real time condition monitoring. The HIA is able to identify and isolate the unexampled faulty states through interactively detecting the deviation of sensory data from the known health states and forming new health states autonomously. The proposed approach takes the advantages of both statistical approaches and artificial intelligence based techniques and integrates them together in a unified diagnosis framework. The performance of proposed MA is demonstrated with a power transformer and roller bearing health diagnosis case studies, where Mahalanobis distance serves as a representative statistical inference approach.;;;;Wang, Pingfeng/D-3764-2011;Wang, Pingfeng/0000-0002-2160-4917;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-0-7918-4502-8;;;;2012;;;;;;;349;360;;;;;;;;;WOS:000335932800034;;;;;;

Many a times those applications demand complex shapes and intricate profiles with stringent design requirements which are not completely achieved by conventional sheet cutting methods. Laser cutting has capability of quality cutting with above requirements in thin sheetmetals. But highly reflective and thermally conductive sheetmetals like Duralumin pose difficulty in achieving quality cuts by laser beam. The kerf taper always occurs in laser cut specimen due to inherent converging-diverging profile of laser beam. The optimization of kerf taper and other cut qualities such as surface roughness, heat affected zone and recast layer formation in difficult-to-laser-cut sheetmetals like Duralumin or Aluminium alloy has become recent research interests. The aim of present research is to optimize kerf taper in pulsed laser cutting of Duralumin sheet using hybrid approach of 'design of experiment (DOE)' and 'artificial intelligence tool' such as genetic algorithm.

Within the SI field, social insects and the concept of stigmergy, in particular, have inspired several significant artworks that question the borders and nature of creativity. This paper addresses generative art created with SI systems and presents a set of images that correspond to a working mechanism of an ant-based clustering algorithm, which uses data samples that interact via the environment and generate what we call abstract swarm paintings. The algorithm, called KANTS, consists in a simple set of equations that model the local behavior of the ants (data samples) in a way that, when travelling on a heterogeneous 2-dimensional lattice of vectors, they tend to form clusters according to the class of each sample. The algorithm was previously proposed for clustering. In this paper, KANTS is used outside a purely scientific framework and applied to data extracted from sleep-Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. With such data, the lattice vectors have three variables, which are used for generating the RGB values of a colored image. Therefore, from the action of the swarm on the environment, we get 2-dimensional colored abstract sketches of human sleep. We call these images pherogenic drawings, since the data used for creating them are actually visual representations of the algorithm's pheromone maps. As a visualization and creative tool, the method is contextualized within the swarm art field.;;;;"Fernandes, Carlos M./N-7928-2016; Merelo, Juan/Z-1636-2019; Rosa, Agostinho/J-8337-2012";"Fernandes, Carlos M./0000-0002-1594-6785; Merelo, JJ/0000-0001-8956-5304; Rosa, Agostinho/0000-0001-5165-3114";;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4503-1178-6;;;;2012;;;;;;;435;442;;;;;;;;;WOS:000394287200057;;;;;;

A good prediction of the behavior of the hazards is a crucial issue to fight against them and to minimize the damages. The models that represent these phenomena need several input parameters and in many cases, such parameters are difficult to know or even to estimate in a real scenario. So, a methodology based on the DDDAS paradigm was developed to calibrate the input parameters according to real observations of the behavior and evolution of the hazard. Such calibrated parameters are then used to provide an improved prediction for the next time interval. This methodology was tested on Forest Fire Propagation Prediction with significant results. The developed methodology takes the fire behavior and propagation during a time interval and then searches for the values of the input parameters that best reproduce the propagation of the fire during that interval. Several Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods were applied to carry out this search as fast as possible. The values of the parameters that best reproduce the behavior of the fire were then used as input parameters to predict the propagation during the next time interval. These parameters were considered constant during both time intervals and a single value for each parameter was used for the calibrating process and for the prediction stage. This methodology fits on the DDDAS paradigm since the prediction is dynamically driven by the system evolution. However, there are several parameters that are not constant through time, but they may vary dynamically. In the case of forest fires, a typical example is the wind. In some cases, when the time interval is short an average value for the wind can be a feasible value, but when the time interval is longer, in most cases, a single value cannot represent the variability of the wind. We can estimate wind behavior applying some complementary model. In this work, we are going a step further considering the dynamic behavior of such parameters. We propose an extension of the existing prediction scheme that takes into account the dynamically changing parameters by coupling a weather prediction system on a DDDAS Forest Fire Propagation Prediction system.;;;;"Cortes, Ana/J-6299-2014; Margalef, Tomas/J-6277-2014";"Cortes, Ana/0000-0003-1697-1293; Margalef, Tomas/0000-0001-6384-7389";;;;;;;;;;;;1877-0509;;;;;;2012;9;;;;;;1110;1118;;10.1016/j.procs.2012.04.120;;;;;;;WOS:000306288400118;;;;;;

This technique initially proposed in the first approaches related to landmarks in classical planning has been outperformed by landmark-based heuristics and has not been paid much attention over the last years. We believe that it is still a promising research direction, particularly for devising distributed search algorithms that could explore different landmark orderings in parallel. To this end, we propose a new method for problem splitting based on landmarks, which has three advantages over the original technique: it is complete (if a solution exists, the algorithm finds it), it uses the precedence relations over the landmarks in a more flexible way (the orderings are explored by way of a best-first search algorithm), and finally it can be easily performed in parallel (by e.g. following the hash-based distribution principle). We lay in this paper the foundations of a meta best-first search algorithm, which explores the landmark orderings and can use any embedded planner to solve each subproblem. It opens up avenues for future research: among them are new heuristics for guiding the meta search towards the most promising orderings, different policies for expanding nodes of the meta search, influence of the embedded subplanner, and parallelization strategies of the meta search.;;;;;Infantes, Guillaume/0000-0001-8940-2433;;;;;;;;;;;;0922-6389;;"978-1-61499-096-3; 978-1-61499-095-6";;;;2012;241;;;;;;336;+;;10.3233/978-1-61499-096-3-336;;;;;;;WOS:000349025700031;;;;;;

It leads to the safety survey of pharmaceutical products. The pharmacovigilance process benefits from the traditional statistical approaches and also from the qualitative information on semantic relations between close ADR terms, such as SMQs or hierarchical levels of MedDRA. In this work, our objective is to detect the semantic relatedness between the ADR MedDRA terms. To achieve this, we combine two approaches: semantic similarity algorithms computed within structured resources and terminology structuring methods applied to a raw list of the MedDRA terms. We compare these methods between them and study their differences and complementarity. The results are evaluated against the gold standard manually compiled within the pharmacovigilance area and also with an expert.

In the present paper we prove a quantitative version of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem for general social choice functions for any number k >= 3 of alternatives. In particular we show that for a social choice function f on k >= 3 alternatives and n voters, which is epsilon-far from the family of nonmanipulable functions, a uniformly chosen voter profile is manipulable with probability at least inverse polynomial in n, k, and epsilon(-1). Removing the neutrality assumption of previous theorems is important for multiple reasons. For one, it is known that there is a conflict between anonymity and neutrality, and since most common voting rules are anonymous, they cannot always be neutral. Second, virtual elections are used in many applications in artificial intelligence, where there are often restrictions on the outcome of the election, and so neutrality is not a natural assumption in these situations. Ours is a unified proof which in particular covers all previous cases established before. The proof crucially uses reverse hypercontractivity in addition to several ideas from the two previous proofs. Much of the work is devoted to understanding functions of a single voter, and in particular we also prove a quantitative Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem for one voter.;;;;;Mossel, Elchanan/0000-0001-7812-7886;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4503-1245-5;;;;2012;;;;;;;1041;1060;;;;;;;;;WOS:000494971000073;;;;;;

First, we present an abstract model that describes the performance of a swarm depending on the swarm density based on the dichotomy between cooperation and interference. Second, we give an abstract model for decision making that is inspired by urn models.

Meanwhile, learning which is a distinctive feature of education is now found so difficult than ever due to lot of interlocking technological changes associated with factors such as lack of skilled teachers/lecturers, materials and tools, infrastructures and funds, just few to mention, that have severely dragged our educational standard to the brim of extinction. Thus, this has also tremendously influenced the direction of modern education.

In this research, the pattern of blood donors' behaviors based on factors influencing blood donation decision is conducted using online questionnaire. These factors, i.e., altruistic values, knowledge in blood donation, perceived risks, attitudes towards blood donation, and intention to donate blood, are analyzed to find out the possibilities for individuals to become blood donors. The surveyed data are used for machine learning techniques of Artificial Intelligence to classify the blood donor group into donors and non-donors. Moreover, the accuracy testing of the surveyed information is conducted using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Decision Tree techniques in order to predict from a series of individual blood behavior data whether or not each individual is a donor. The results indicate that the accuracy, precision, and recall values of ANN technique are higher than those of the Decision Tree technique.

Data aggregation is defined as the process of aggregating the data from multiple sensors to eliminate redundant transmission and provide fused information to the base station. The main goal of data-aggregation algorithms is to gather and aggregate data in an energy efficient manner so that network lifetime is enhanced. Data aggregation helps in improving the performance of the wireless sensor network protocols especially the routing protocols which in turn improve the overall performance of the network. Hierarchical networks or Clustering is very important for data aggregation, where the sensor nodes are divided into groups and assigned various roles. Computational Intelligence combines elements of learning, adaptation, evolution and fuzzy logic to solve complex problems. The paradigms of CI include neuro-computing, reinforcement learning, evolutionary computing and fuzzy computing, techniques that use swarm intelligence, artificial immune systems and hybrids of two or more of the above. Paradigms of CI have found practical applications in areas such as product design, robotics, intelligent control, biometrics, and sensor networks. Researchers have successfully used CI techniques to address many challenges in WSNs in various fields including data aggregation. In this paper, the prospects and considerations for a CI based data aggregation technique in clustered networks is discussed and concluded that apart from the conventional data aggregation techniques, there is a need to look for non conventional solutions like CI for making efficient data aggregation techniques.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2078-0958;;978-988-19252-4-4;;;;2012;;;;;;;919;924;;;;;;;;;WOS:000398980000045;;;;;;

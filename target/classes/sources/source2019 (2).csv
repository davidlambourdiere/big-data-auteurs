In this direction, the principle of fuzzy logic, a paradigm of AI technique, is effectively being utilized to predict various performance measures (responses) and control the parametric settings of those machining processes. This paper presents the application of fuzzy logic to model two non-traditional machining (NTM) processes, i.e. electrical discharge machining (EDM) and electrochemical machining (ECM) processes, while identifying the relationships present between the process parameters and the measured responses. Moreover, the interaction plots which are developed based on the past experimental observations depict the effects of changing values of different process parameters on the measured responses. The predicted response values derived from the developed models are observed to be in close agreement with those as investigated during the past experimental runs. The interaction plots also play significant roles in identifying the optimal parametric combinations so as to achieve the desired responses for the considered NTM processes.;;;;Das, Partha Protim/AAI-4761-2020;;;;;;;;;;;;;2080-8208;2082-1344;;;;SEP;2019;10;3;;;;;111;123;;10.24425/mper.2019.130504;;;;;;;WOS:000488074200011;;;;;;

For purposes of these research a dataset of 5608 marine object images is collected by using Google satellite imagery and Google Image Search. The dataset is divided in two main classes (Vessels and Other objects) and each class is divided into four sub-classes (Vessels sub-classes are Cargo ships, Cruise ships, War ships and Boats, while Other objects sub-classes are Waves, Marine animals, Garbage patches and Oil spills). For recognition of marine objects, an algorithm constructed with three CNNs is proposed. The first CNN for classification on the main classes achieves accuracy of 92.37 %. The CNN used for vessels recognition achieves accuracies of 94.12 0 /0 for cargo ships recognition, 98.82 % for cruise ships recognition, 97.64 % for war ships recognition and 95.29 % for boats recognition. The CNN used for recognition of other objects achieves accuracies of 88.56 % for waves and marine animals recognition, 96.92 %for garbage patches recognition and 89.21 0 /0 for oil spills recognition.This research has shown that CNN is appropriate artificial intelligence (Al) method for marine object recognition from aerial imagery.;;;;"Mrzljak, Vedran/L-1153-2017; Lorencin, Ivan/S-7228-2018; Car, Zlatan/L-6484-2015";"Mrzljak, Vedran/0000-0003-0323-2600; Lorencin, Ivan/0000-0002-5964-245X; Car, Zlatan/0000-0003-2817-9252";;;;;;;;;;;;0469-6255;1848-6320;;;;SEP;2019;66;3;;;;;112;119;;10.17818/NM/2019/3.3;;;;;;;WOS:000488263600004;;;;;;
J;Jackson, BL;;;;Jackson, Barry L.;;;Future Shock Revisited;POSTMODERN OPENINGS;;;;;;;;;;;;In 1970, Alvin Toffler wrote his ground breaking and alarming book warning of the psychological shock people face as technologies were developing at a pace faster than ever before. He predicted the technical evolution would cause major disruption in society and values. It would force worker dislocation, generational conflicts and moral and ethical challenges. The time period of which Toffler wrote is now often referred to as the Third Industrial Revolution. Today we are witnessing vet another Industrial Revolution in the Western and Developed nations. Innovations in instant communications, quantum computing, nanotechnologies, bioengineering, three-dimensional printing, artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous vehicles, etc. are already reshaping the world. These advances in science are redistributing resources and wealth, changing the methods of manufacturing of goods, altering the delivery systems of consumer and human services, and challenging the very notion of What or Who is alive as robots become more human-like, and displace millions of workers whose livelihood depends on jobs which will be lost to robots and three-dimensional printing. The social and psychological impacts of these exponentially increasing changes are Future Shock on a much larger scale perhaps than ever before experienced. Traditional ethics, morals, religions and social interactions, even politics and national boundaries are strained by mass migration as people seek safety and new economic opportunity in technologically advanced nations. Psychologists, counsellors, social workers, social engineers, philosophers and politicians need to act now as the future has already forced the presence's door open to this latest revolution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2068-0236;2069-9387;;;;SEP;2019;10;3;;;;;102;116;;10.18662/po/84;;;;;;;WOS:000488263200006;;;;;;
J;Rotila, V;;;;Rotila, Viorel;;;The Future of Social Dialogue in the Age of Artificial Intelligence;POSTMODERN OPENINGS;;;;;;;;;;;;The survival of social dialogue depends on the extent of the social changes, being conditioned by the maintenance of the labour relations and by the models of representation of trade union type. Uncertainties regarding the future of work are automatically transformed into uncertainties regarding the future of trade unionism and social dialogue. Work is a type of social relationship that has significantly contributed to who we are. We can assume that as long as humanity lasts, work will exist (not necessarily with its present significance). We consider that the fate of social dialogue is linked to the future of trade unionism. Unions try to defend a model of balance needed within a specific type of social relations called labour relations. In order for the unions to have chances of survival (and, together with them, the social dialogue as well) these must embrace change, orientating it in the directions appropriate to their purpose. We use the phrase cyber-unionism because the main recommended way is the involvement of the unions in the use and development of Al, respectively of the new technologies and of the specific research. The overall solution: a reform of trade unionism based on a new ideology and the increase of power as a result of the use of new technologies. The scenarios proposed in this article go beyond an obvious limit: they explore the possibilities of evolution of the society using possible solutions in order to meet our current goals. The solutions discussed do not take into account the change of the wishes of the people in time, being impossible to anticipate the directions of evolution of the objectives of humanity. Our approach is between what we think it will be and what we think it should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2068-0236;2069-9387;;;;SEP;2019;10;3;;;;;151;189;;10.18662/po/87;;;;;;;WOS:000488263200009;;;;;;

Because of growing market and increasing the loan applications, this field still continues its concern in terms of rating the applicants and assessing the credit amounts. To reduce the number of wrong decisions in the credit evaluation process, the decision makers focus on estimating more robust models. However, the traditional methods are criticized due to various pre-requisites and linear approximations in the high dimensional and excessive nonlinear cases. For this reason, artificial intelligence techniques are mostly preferred to handle the credit scoring problems accurately. This study presents an efficient procedure that is based on ANNs with cross-entropy and fuzzy relations in the context of the credit scoring. In the implementations, the proposed procedure is applied to a couple of benchmark credit scoring data sets and its performance is compared with traditional approaches.;;;;"Kocadagli, Ozan/AAW-4669-2020; Ilter, Damla/AAN-8883-2020";Ilter, Damla/0000-0002-9844-4616;;;;;;;;;;;;1304-7205;1304-7191;;;;SEP;2019;37;3;;;;;855;870;;;;;;;;;WOS:000488302000013;;;;;;

A Game Theory Perspective on Self-Access Learning;STUDIES IN SELF-ACCESS LEARNING JOURNAL;;;;;;;;;;;;The applicability of game theory (Osborne, 2004) to the design and management of learning activities within a self-access learning center is discussed in relation to encouraging unmotivated students to engage more with autonomous study. Through discussion of some basic principles of game theory and how they might apply to self-access learning, a theoretical example is used to demonstrate how the costs and rewards of activities can be balanced using game theory in such a way as to encourage students to complete activities in order to foster autonomy and motivation. Further examples from game theory are provided to show how it can explain some of the counterintuitive results often seen in self-access learning at Japanese universities. Possible future quantification metrics are briefly discussed in relation to the human-capital and social-capital costs and payoffs involved in student use of self-access learning centers. A game theory perspective on self-access learning may offer the potential benefit of providing a quantitative model that might allow the application of artificial intelligence and a complex dynamic systems approach to student usage data.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2185-3762;;;;;SEP;2019;10;3;;;;;223;238;;10.37237/100302;;;;;;;WOS:000488631100002;;;;;;
J;"Ruohomaa, H; Salminen, V; Kunttu, I";;;;"Ruohomaa, Heikki; Salminen, Vesa; Kunttu, Iivari";;;Towards Smart City Concept in Small Cities;TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MANAGEMENT REVIEW;;;;;;;;;;;;The smart city concept brings together technology, government and different layers of society, utilizing technological enablers, such as the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). These enablers, in turn, facilitate development of various aspects of the smart city including, e.g., transportation, governance, education, safety and communications. However, the transition towards smarter cities involves not only technological development but also the changing and evolving roles of citizens, service providers and city authorities. In this transition, the key issue is creating and growing roles of collaboration, participation and coordination. Whereas mainstream research focuses on smart city transformation in big cities, aspects of this transformation in the context of small cities has been a widely neglected topic. This paper presents three cases of smart city development in small cities in Finland, each concentrating on a different aspect of smart city development. The cases reveal how a relatively small-sized city may take remarkable steps in smart city development by selecting a specific theme on which to build smart city activities. These examples also emphasize the critical role of public sector actors, showing that the public sector has a key role in creating the foundations for fruitful ecosystem-based development work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1927-0321;;;;;SEP;2019;9;9;;;;;5;14;;10.22215/timreview/1264;;;;;;;WOS:000488302700002;;;;;;
J;Madsen, DO;;;;Madsen, Dag Oivind;;;The Emergence and Rise of Industry 4.0 Viewed through the Lens of Management Fashion Theory;ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES;;;;;;;;;;;;The Industry 4.0 (I4.0) concept is concerned with the fourth industrial revolution in manufacturing, in which technological trends such as digitalization, automation and artificial intelligence are transforming production processes. Since the concept's introduction at the Hannover Fair in Germany in 2011, I4.0 has enjoyed a meteoric rise in popularity and is currently high on the agenda of governments, politicians and business elites. In light of these observations, some commentators have asked the question of whether I4.0 is a concept that is hyped up and possibly just the latest in a long line of fashionable management concepts introduced over the course of the last few decades. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a critical outside-in look at the emergence and rise of I4.0. Theoretically, these processes are viewed through the lens of management fashion, a theoretical perspective well suited to examinations of evolutionary trajectories of management concepts and ideas. The findings indicate that the I4.0 concept has quickly become highly popular and is dominating much of the popular management discourse. The concept has migrated out of the specialized manufacturing discourse to become a more general concept with mainstream appeal and applicability, evidenced by a multitude of neologisms such as Work 4.0 and Innovation 4.0. The numbers 4.0 have spread in a meme-like fashion, evidenced by the fact that the combination of a noun and the numbers 4.0 are used to signal and usher in discussions about the future of business and society. While there is much evidence that clearly shows that the concept has had a wide-ranging impact at the discursive level, the currently available research is less clear about what impact the concept has had so far on industries and organizations worldwide.;;;;Madsen, Dag Oivind/I-1587-2016;Madsen, Dag Oivind/0000-0001-8735-3332;;;;;;;;;;;;;2076-3387;;;;SEP;2019;9;3;;;;;;;71;10.3390/admsci9030071;;;;;;;WOS:000487987200024;;;;;;

Stakeholders in social safety net programs (SSNPs) target vulnerable groups, such as the urban poor, women, the unemployed, and the elderly, with initiatives that have a transformative impact. Inadequate policy awareness remains a challenge, resulting in low participation rates in SSNPs. To achieve all-inclusive development, deliberate policies and programs that target this population have to be initiated by government, corporate bodies, and public-minded individuals. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques could play an important role in improving the managerial decision support and policy-making process of SSNPs and increasing the social resilience of urban populations. To enhance managerial decision-making in social investment programs, we used a Bayesian network to develop an intelligent decision support system called the Social Safety Net Expert System (SSNES). Using the SSNES, we provide an advisory system to stakeholders who make management decisions, which clearly demonstrates the efficacy of SSNPs and inclusive development.;;;;"Damasevicius, Robertas/E-1387-2017; Maskeliunas, Rytis/J-7173-2017; Misra, Sanjay/K-2203-2014";"Damasevicius, Robertas/0000-0001-9990-1084; Maskeliunas, Rytis/0000-0002-2809-2213; Misra, Sanjay/0000-0002-3556-9331";;;;;;;;;;;;;2076-3387;;;;SEP;2019;9;3;;;;;;;55;10.3390/admsci9030055;;;;;;;WOS:000487987200017;;;;;;

As attacks are on the rise, cybersecurity should be considered as a prime concern while developing new networks.

In this paper, we propose a new intrusion detection system using a random neural network and an artificial bee colony algorithm (RNN-ABC). The model is trained and tested with the benchmark NSL-KDD data set. Accuracy and other metrics, such as the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed RNN-ABC, are compared with the traditional gradient descent algorithm-based RNN. While the overall accuracy remains at 95.02%, the performance is also estimated in terms of mean of the mean squared error (MMSE), standard deviation of MSE (SDMSE), best mean squared error (BMSE), and worst mean squared error (WMSE) parameters, which further confirms the superiority of the proposed scheme over the traditional methods.";;;;"Javed, Abbas/AAD-7092-2019; Ahmad, Jawad/AAC-3119-2020";"Javed, Abbas/0000-0001-9243-4364; Ahmad, Jawad/0000-0001-6289-8248; Larijani, Hadi/0000-0002-6826-207X";;;;;;;;;;;;2073-431X;;;;;SEP;2019;8;3;;;;;;;59;10.3390/computers8030059;;;;;;;WOS:000487950600019;;;;;;
J;"Amini, S; Mohaghegh, S";;;;"Amini, Shohreh; Mohaghegh, Shahab";;;Application of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Proxy Modeling for Fluid Flow in Porous Media;FLUIDS;;;;;;;;;;;;Reservoir simulation models are the major tools for studying fluid flow behavior in hydrocarbon reservoirs. These models are constructed based on geological models, which are developed by integrating data from geology, geophysics, and petro-physics. As the complexity of a reservoir simulation model increases, so does the computation time. Therefore, to perform any comprehensive study which involves thousands of simulation runs, a very long period of time is required. Several efforts have been made to develop proxy models that can be used as a substitute for complex reservoir simulation models. These proxy models aim at generating the outputs of the numerical fluid flow models in a very short period of time. This research is focused on developing a proxy fluid flow model using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. In this work, the proxy model is developed for a real case CO2 sequestration project in which the objective is to evaluate the dynamic reservoir parameters (pressure, saturation, and CO2 mole fraction) under various CO2 injection scenarios. The data-driven model that is developed is able to generate pressure, saturation, and CO2 mole fraction throughout the reservoir with significantly less computational effort and considerably shorter period of time compared to the numerical reservoir simulation model.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2311-5521;;;;SEP;2019;4;3;;;;;;;126;10.3390/fluids4030126;;;;;;;WOS:000488029400032;;;;;;

However, to ensure their usefulness in practice, the credibility of the simulations needs to be established with uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods. The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) has been applying non-intrusive UQ methodologies to categorize and quantify uncertainties in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of gas-solid multiphase flows. To reduce the computational cost associated with gas-solid flow simulations required for UQ analysis, techniques commonly used in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) and data mining are used to construct smart proxy models, which can reduce the computational cost of conducting large numbers of multiphase CFD simulations. The feasibility of using AI and machine learning to construct a smart proxy for a gas-solid multiphase flow has been investigated by looking at the flow and particle behavior in a non-reacting rectangular fluidized bed. The NETL's in house multiphase solver, Multiphase Flow with Interphase eXchanges (MFiX), was used to generate simulation data for the rectangular fluidized bed. The artificial neural network (ANN) was used to construct a CFD smart proxy, which is able to reproduce the CFD results with reasonable error (about 10%). Several blind cases were used to validate this technology. The results show a good agreement with CFD runs while the approach is less computationally expensive. The developed model can be used to generate the time averaged results of any given fluidized bed with the same geometry with different inlet velocity in couple of minutes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2311-5521;;;;SEP;2019;4;3;;;;;;;123;10.3390/fluids4030123;;;;;;;WOS:000488029400026;;;;;;

The Colebrook's equation is implicit in the flow friction factor and, therefore, it needs to be solved iteratively or using explicit approximations, which need to be developed using different approaches. Various procedures can be used for iterative methods, such as single the fixed-point iterative method, Newton-Raphson, and other types of multi-point iterative methods, iterative methods in a combination with Pade polynomials, special functions such as Lambert W, artificial intelligence such as neural networks, etc. In addition, to develop explicit approximations or to improve their accuracy, regression analysis, genetic algorithms, and curve fitting techniques can be used too. In this learning numerical exercise, a few numerical examples will be shown along with the explanation of the estimated pedagogical impact for university students.

By utilizing the cloud computing concept, distributed, scalable and elastic computing resources are provided to the end-users over high speed computer networks (the Internet). Cloudlet scheduling that has a significant impact on the overall cloud system performance represents one of the most important challenges in this domain. In this paper, we introduce implementations of the original and hybridized monarch butterfly optimization algorithm that belongs to the category of swarm intelligence metaheuristics, adapted for tackling the cloudlet scheduling problem. The hybridized monarch butterfly optimization approach, as well as adaptations of any monarch butterfly optimization version for the cloudlet scheduling problem, could not be found in the literature survey. Both algorithms were implemented within the environment of the CloudSim platform. The proposed hybridized version of the monarch butterfly optimization algorithm was first tested on standard benchmark functions and, after that, the simulations for the cloudlet scheduling problem were performed using artificial and real data sets. Based on the obtained simulation results and the comparative analysis with six other state-of-the-art metaheuristics and heuristics, under the same experimental conditions and tested on the same problem instances, a hybridized version of the monarch butterfly optimization algorithm proved its potential for tackling the cloudlet scheduling problem. It has been established that the proposed hybridized implementation is superior to the original one, and also that the task scheduling problem in cloud environments can be more efficiently solved by using such an algorithm with positive implications to the cloud management.;;;;"Tuba, Eva/U-2526-2017; Tuba, Milan/B-6779-2009";"Tuba, Eva/0000-0003-4866-9048; Strumberger, Ivana/0000-0002-1154-6696; Tuba, Milan/0000-0003-3794-3056; Bacanin, Nebojsa/0000-0002-2062-924X";;;;;;;;;;;;;2224-2708;;;;SEP;2019;8;3;;;;;;;44;10.3390/jsan8030044;;;;;;;WOS:000488002000005;;;;;;

In this paper, we study a statistical modeling problem of data coming from a simulation model that investigates the correctness of autonomous agents' decisions in learning to cross a cellular automaton-based highway. The goal is a better understanding of cognitive agents' performance in learning to cross a cellular automaton-based highway with different traffic density. We investigate the effects of parameters' values of the simulation model (e.g., knowledge base transfer, car creation probability, agents' fear and desire to cross the highway) and their interactions on cognitive agents' decisions (i.e., correct crossing decisions, incorrect crossing decisions, correct waiting decisions, and incorrect waiting decisions). We firstly utilize canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to see if all the considered parameters' values and decision types are significantly statistically correlated, so that no considered dependent variables or independent variables (i.e., decision types and configuration parameters, respectively) can be omitted from the simulation model in potential future studies. After CCA, we then use the regression tree method to explore the effects of model configuration parameters' values on the agents' decisions. In particular, we focus on the discussion of the effects of the knowledge base transfer, which is a key factor in the investigation on how accumulated knowledge/information about the agents' performance in one traffic environment affects the agents' learning outcomes in another traffic environment. This factor affects the cognitive agents' decision-making abilities in a major way in a new traffic environment where the cognitive agents start learning from existing accumulated knowledge/information about their performance in an environment with different traffic density. The obtained results provide us with a better understanding of how cognitive agents learn to cross the highway, i.e., how the knowledge base transfer as a factor affects the experimental outcomes. Furthermore, the proposed methodology can become useful in modeling and analyzing data coming from other computer simulation models and can provide an approach for better understanding a factor or treatment effect.;;;;;Xie, Shengkun/0000-0002-9533-2096;;;;;;;;;;;;;2079-3197;;;;SEP;2019;7;3;;;;;;;53;10.3390/computation7030053;;;;;;;WOS:000487943500019;;;;;;

There is no close correlation between changes, and especially between the development of the brain and technologies sequentially controlled by humans. The materials science appeared as an independent branch of knowledge only in the late 1950s. Technical aspects of the product launch on the market relate to several technical aspects; engineering design is a significant conceptual phase of this activity, and within it, the material design. The expected functional properties of the product will be assured only if the right expected material is used and is produced in a suitably selected expected technological process that will provide both the expected shape and other geometric features of the product, including assembly and the expected structure of the material, ensuring the expected mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of the material, the use of which ensures the expected application of the product. The given rule defines the paradigm of contemporary materials science and engineering. Without the use of engineering materials and without the development of manufacturing processes, it is impossible to manufacture any product and make it available to consumers. The material design process in history has gone through a long period of changes. Initially, for millions of years and almost a century ago, materials were selected based on the trial and error method, which is stage Materials 1.0. Currently, about 80 % of work in the field of engineering materials development and material design is carried out in accordance with the Materials 2.0 protocol. The Materials 2.0 protocol includes more systematic material research, ranging from conceptualization, systematic laboratory experiments to verify the idea, prototyping in the laboratory and real conditions, and testing and validating prototypes and life cycle assessment to use the results of research in product production. Materials 3.0 use computational materials science materials, and materials are computationally designed with a target functionality. Only the idea of Materials 4.0 overcomes human limitations in applying existing knowledge about the theory of materials, processing, and properties through the use of cyber-physical space. In manufacturing processes generally after the era of water and steam and mass production based on the division of labor with the use of electricity, and then the use of electronics and information technology for the automation of production processes, there is a dynamic use of cyber-physical systems, the Internet of objects, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality, currently guaranteeing the production progress at the stage of the Industry 4.0 industrial revolution. So far, nine technologies have been designated as determining the change in industrial production at the Industry 4.0 stage. According to the authors of this article, it is necessary to augment this list by manufacturing processes and engineering materials as well as living and bioengineering machines; therefore, in total, there will be 12 technologies determining the changes in production in the Industry 4.0 stage. Omitting these issues would make it impossible to manufacture any products available on the market, and the idea of Industry 4.0 presented would be incomplete. The importance of carbon-based materials is also presented, and several results of our own research on various materials are presented, with an indication of application possibilities.";;;;Dobrzanska-Danikiewicz, Anna/M-9117-2016;Dobrzanska-Danikiewicz, Anna/0000-0001-7335-5759;;;;;;;;;;;;2379-1365;2165-3992;;;;SEP;2019;8;3;;;SI;;337;370;;10.1520/MPC20190145;;;;;;;WOS:000487699400001;;;;;;

We live in an era where data generation is exponential with time but if the generated data is not put to work or not converted to knowledge data, its generation is of no use. Similarly, in Healthcare also, data availability is high, so is the need to extract the information from it for better prognosis, diagnosis, treatment, drug development, and overall healthcare. In this research, we have tried to focus more on diagnosis of Diabetes disease, which is one of the fastest growing chronic diseases all over the world as declared by World Health Organization in the year 2014.

Indeed, ASP can model problems in NP in a compact and elegant way. However, modeling problems beyond NP with ASP is known to be complicated, on the one hand, and limited to problems in Sigma(P)(2) on the other. Inspired by the way Quantified Boolean Formulas extend SAT formulas to model problems beyond NP, we propose an extension of ASP that introduces quantifiers over stable models of programs. We name the new language ASP with Quantifiers (ASP(Q)). In the paper we identify computational properties of ASP(Q); we highlight its modeling capabilities by reporting natural encodings of several complex problems with applications in artificial intelligence and number theory; and we compare ASP(Q) with related languages. Arguably, ASP(Q) allows one to model problems in the Polynomial Hierarchy in a direct way, providing an elegant expansion of ASP beyond the class NP.";;;;Amendola, Giovanni/Q-1859-2018;Amendola, Giovanni/0000-0002-2111-9671;;;;;;;;;;;;1471-0684;1475-3081;;;;SEP;2019;19;5-6;;;SI;;705;721;;10.1017/S1471068419000140;;;;;;;WOS:000487090500006;;;;;;

J;Kato, Y;;;;Kato, Yukiko;;;Between Life and Non-Life: Sachiko Kodama's Black and Bridget Riley's Pink;AM JOURNAL OF ART AND MEDIA STUDIES;;;;;;;;;;;;"The contemporary world is so technological that humans are located on the verge of life and non-life. Computers, cyborgs, artificial intelligence, and androids permeate human society, and people are even fascinated by such menaces of the non-life. This paper clarifies why contemporary society loves the idea of the rise of artificial beings by analyzing the use of artificial colors - black and pink - by the cutting-edge female artists Sachiko Kodama and Bridget Riley. Media artist Kodama uses black liquid while the abstract artist Riley uses pink pigments as key materials. According to Asao Komachiya, black is the color of the blind; it appears on the verge of being and non-being. Meanwhile, Barbara Nemitz identifies pink as an artificial color that does not exist in the spectrum of sunlight. Both colors are highly evaluated in technological and consumer society and widely used on many goods. Kodama's and Riley's high reputation signifies that contemporary society likes the precarious artificial beings between life and non-life. Moreover, their original and unique works have realized the field of liberty as their extensive use of artificial colors black and pink indicates ultra-human. Kodama's and Riley's gender is also key. As Dora Haraway suggests in Cyborg Manifesto (1991), contemporary women, historically dealt with as peripheral existences, survive as ultra-human beings rather than the ancient goddesses. By considering significant female artists such as Kodama and Riley, we can understand not only the contemporary aesthetics of visual arts, but also the concurrent yearning of contemporary society for liberty, ultra- humanity, and non-life.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2217-9666;2406-1654;;;;SEP;2019;19;;;;;;109;115;;10.25038/am.v0i19.311;;;;;;;WOS:000486265600010;;;;;;

A computer based algorithm based upon standardized questionnaire (from established assessment tools) is designed to assess the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). In addition the incorporation of basic screening questions of anamnesis help in suggesting a probable diagnosis of sleep related disorder as well. The overall data at our center has been analyzed to establish the existing pattern of sleep related disorders. Of 850 healthy subjects screened, prevalence of snoring was 20.47% while OSAS was seen in 4.20% (N = 25) in males and 2.64% (N = 8) in females. The parasomnia was most prevalent (14.71%), followed by insomnia (10.24%), periodic leg movement (6.59%), bruxism (1.65%) and narcolepsy (0.59%). Hypertension, laryngopharyngeal reflux and obesity were the common co-morbidities in OSAS while family history of hypertension and diabetes were common in snorers. A significant association with OSA was seen with diabetes mellitus, neck circumference and nasal obstruction, while, obesity and apnoeic episodes were more significantly associated with OSA than snorers. Increased waist to hip ratio was appreciated in both the OSAS and snorers. The algorithm based online assessment is likely to diagnose the occult clinical cases as well as assess the risk of OSAS. In routine outpatient clinic, a clinician may better assess the patient morbidity with a comprehensive availability of symptoms and moreover enhance the post-treatment compliance. In addition a smartphone based computerized assessment for general population may be designed for other lifestyle disorders as well.;;;;;Mishra, Anupam/0000-0002-2289-9104;;;;;;;;;;;;2231-3796;0973-7707;;;;SEP;2019;71;3;;;;;352;359;;10.1007/s12070-019-01607-z;;;;;;;WOS:000486212200013;31559203;;;;;

The techniques of networks are recently being applied to biomedical disciplines, where the complexity of biomedical systems requires new schemes that can process elevated volumes of data with high efficiency. Artificial neural networks, on which much of artificial intelligence relies, are statistical models partially modeled on biological neural networks. They are capable of modeling and processing nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs in parallel-in opposition to deterministic models and classical computation schemes, which perform tasks in linear sequences of calculations and may fail to keep up with the challenges of complex biological systems. For these biological or bio-inspired systems, the performance of the networks depends on their topological characteristics. Here, we generated a large number of configurations of points in a plane, in which the entropy s of the configurations was varied over large intervals. Then, we connected points using the Waxman model to obtain the corresponding networks. In correlating the entropy (s) to the small-world coefficient (SW) of those networks, we found that SW varies hyperbolically with s as SW = 0.88 + 0.28/s, where s is expressed in millibits per node. Since the entropy of a distribution of points depends in turn on the density of those points in the plane, such a relationship suggests that the distribution of mass (s) in a complex system determines the topological characteristics (SW) of that system. The small-world-ness of the system, in turn, determines its information efficiency. These findings may have implications in neuromorphic engineering, where chips modeled on biological brains may lead to machines that are able, as for some examples, to diagnose diseases, develop drugs and drug delivery systems faster, design personalized treatments targeted to patient's needs.;;;;"Onesto, Valentina/S-6488-2017; amato, francesco/E-8757-2013";"Onesto, Valentina/0000-0002-2308-4126; amato, francesco/0000-0002-9053-3139";;;;;;;;;;;;2399-6528;;;;;SEP;2019;3;9;;;;;;;95011;10.1088/2399-6528/ab41e2;;;;;;;WOS:000486371400001;;;;;;

The utilitarian approach can be a solution, especially the one that uses agent-based theory. We have chosen two extreme cases: combat drones, vectors of death, and life supporting companion robots. The ethics of AI and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) must be studied on the basis of military ethics and human values when fighting. Despite the fact that they are not programmed to hurt humans or harm their dignity, companion robots can potentially endanger their social, moral as well as their physical integrity. An important ethical condition is that companion robots help the nursing staff to take better care of patients while not replacing them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1433-5298;1614-7456;;;;SEP;2019;24;3;;;;;291;296;;10.1007/s10015-019-00525-1;;;;;;;WOS:000484570200002;;;;;;

Prem";;;Artificial Intelligence based Network Intrusion Detection with hyper-parameter optimization tuning on the realistic cyber dataset CSE-CIC-IDS2018 using cloud computing;ICT EXPRESS;;;;;;;;;;;;One of the latest emerging technologies is artificial intelligence, which makes the machine mimic human behaviour. The most important component used to detect cyber attacks or malicious activities is the intrusion detection system (IDS). Artificial intelligence plays a vital role in detecting intrusions and widely considered as the better way in adapting and building IDS. In modern days, neural network algorithms are emerging as a new artificial intelligence technique that can be applied to real-time problems. The proposed system is to detect a classification of botnet attack which poses a serious threat to financial sectors and banking services. The proposed system is created by applying artificial intelligence on a realistic cyber defence dataset (CSE-CIC-IDS2018), the latest IDS Dataset in 2018 by Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC) on AWS (Amazon Web Services). The proposed system of Artificial Neural Networks provides an outstanding performance of Accuracy score 99.97%, an average area under ROC(Receiver Operator Characteristic) curve 0.999 and the average False Positive rate is a mere value of 0.03. The proposed system of Artificial Intelligence-based Intrusion detection of botnet attack classification is powerful, more accurate and precise. The novel proposed system can be applied to conventional network traffic analysis, cyber-physical system traffic analysis and also can be applied to the real-time network traffic data analysis.

The presence/absence tree species data were from 77 fragments sampled with 2,234 plots. We used 12 categorical environmental variables from the Economic Ecological Zoning of Minas Gerais (ZEE/MG), as well as variables related to soil water balance (current and potential evapotranspiration, aridity and alpha index). The parameterization of the three algorithms was done with cv parameter algorithm of the WEKA software. The results showed the applied algorithms were statistically similar for 60% of the tree species. The random forest and multilayer perceptron algorithms were statistically similar considering the Eugenia dysenterica and superior to J48 algorithm. However, the random forest algorithm was superior to the other for the three species of Qualea genera. The conclusion is the random forest was the most robust model for the potential distribution habitat of tree species.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2318-7670;;;;;SEP-OCT;2019;7;5;;;;;600;606;;10.31413/nativa.v7i5.7214;;;;;;;WOS:000485808600019;;;;;;

The rise of deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offers fascinating perspectives for the automation of medical image analysis. In this systematic review article, we screened the current literature and investigated the following question: Can deep learning algorithms for image recognition improve visual diagnosis in medicine?'' Materials and methods: We provide a systematic review of the articles using CNNs for medical image analysis, published in the medical literature before May 2019. Articles were screened based on the following items: type of image analysis approach (detection or classification), algorithm architecture, dataset used, training phase, test, comparison method (with specialists or other), results (accuracy, sensibility and specificity) and conclusion. Results: We identified 352 articles in the PubMed database and excluded 327 items for which performance was not assessed (review articles) or for which tasks other than detection or classification, such as segmentation, were assessed. The 25 included papers were published from 2013 to 2019 and were related to a vast array of medical specialties. Authors were mostly from North America and Asia. Large amounts of qualitative medical images were necessary to train the CNNs, often resulting from international collaboration. The most common CNNs such as AlexNet and GoogleNet, designed for the analysis of natural images, proved their applicability to medical images. Conclusion: CNNs are not replacement solutions for medical doctors, but will contribute to optimize routine tasks and thus have a potential positive impact on our practice. Specialties with a strong visual component such as radiology and pathology will be deeply transformed. Medical practitioners, including surgeons, have a key role to play in the development and implementation of such devices.

Considered is the case of a fully autonomous ship capable of making decisions and determining actions by itself without active supervision on the part of onboard crew or remote human operators. These techniques, when combined with advanced sensor capabilities, have been touted as a means to overcome existing technical and human limitations as unmanned and autonomous ships become operational presently and in upcoming years. Promises of the extraordinary capabilities of these technologies that may even exceed those of crewmembers for decision making under comparable conditions must be tempered with realistic expectations as to their ultimate technical potential, their use in the maritime domain, vulnerabilities that may preclude their safe operation; and methods for development, integration and test. The results of research performed by the author in specific applications of machine learning and AI to shipping are presented citing key factors that must be achieved for certification of these technologies as being suitable for their intended purpose.

J;Alop, A;;;;Alop, A.;;;The Main Challenges and Barriers to the Successful Smart Shipping;TRANSNAV-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON MARINE NAVIGATION AND SAFETY OF SEA TRANSPORTATION;;;;;;;;;;;;As with the powerful digitalization of the world in the 21st century, maritime affairs, like all other areas, are facing not only new opportunities, but also new big challenges and problems. From the point of view of the development of new technologies, it seems that everything is possible, for example the bringing of so-called intelligent ships and smart ports into one global system on base of internet of things and big data applications. However, if to look at the matter further, a number of factors and obstacles may appear which could be major threats to the normal functioning of such a system. While it is clear that systems with such high degree of complexity are even technically vulnerable, it seems to the author of this paper that questions that are no less difficult are in the field of human relations. For example, when ships and ports are becoming more and more smarter and need less and less people to intervene in their interactions, who at the end will be responsible for everything that can and definitely will happened at sea or in the port? What about liability of cargo carrier if carrier is an autonomous ship without any person on-board during the entire journey? How to ensure cyber security? How to be secured against the risks of so-called artificial intelligence systemic errors? It is possible that only new non-trivial approaches can lead to acceptable results in this area, but what they may be and whether these approaches are possible at all - these questions are still waiting for answers.;;;;Alop, Anatoli/AAE-9276-2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;2083-6473;2083-6481;;;;SEP;2019;13;3;;;;;521;528;;10.12716/1001.13.03.05;;;;;;;WOS:000484342700005;;;;;;

Although ultrasound (US) has been reported to be superior to needle electromyography (EMG) and visual inspection in terms of detection rates, other similar movements could lower the reliability of the result. Artificial intelligence, such as deep learning, promises to enhance the classification of visual data. Aim To classify fasciculation and its mimics by deep learning. Methods Using an 11-MHz linear-array transducer, muscle US was recorded from the biceps brachii and tibialis anterior muscles. Fasciculation for patients with ALS, and movements of voluntary muscles or the recording probe of healthy individuals were recorded. Background subtraction was performed to obtain binary images to infer movements. Deep learning was performed using five different networks with and without pre-trained weights. Results Three groups of images were divided into training, validation, and test (fasciculation: N = 1473; voluntary movement: N = 861; probe movement: N = 1626). The accuracy of detection with pre-trained weights (fine-tuning) ranged from 0.959 to 1.0. The best accuracy was obtained by VGG16/19 convolutional neural networks and the ResNet-152 network. Accuracy of prediction was considerably lower without the pre-trained weights. The mean white pixels (inferring movements) were lower in fasciculation than in the voluntary and probe movement groups; however, the non-fasciculation groups showed similar pixel counts (P = 0.95). Conclusions US accurately distinguished between fasciculation and its mimics by deep learning. Pixel counting could be a reliable quantitative method to detect fasciculation.";;;;;Nodera, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-5357-5081;;;;;;;;;;;;2049-4173;;;;;SEP;2019;7;5;;;;;267;275;;10.1111/ncn3.12307;;;;;;;WOS:000483566100003;;;;;;

This paper seeks to present an outline of Peirce's triadic logic as a practical new way to model vagueness in the context of artificial intelligence (AI). Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914) was an American scientist-philosopher and a great logician whose triadic logic is a culmination of the study of semiotics and the mathematical study of anti-Cantorean model of continuity and infinitesimals. After presenting Peircean semiotics within AI perspective, a mathematical formulation of a Peircean triadic set is given in relationship with classical and fuzzy sets. Using basic logical operators, all possible respective implication operators, bi-equivalence operators, valid rules of inference, and associative, distributive and commutative logical properties are derived and verified through the truth function approach. In order to suggest practical directions, aggregation operators for Peirce's triadic logic have been formulated. A mathematical formulation of a medical diagnostic problem and ER diagram of a library management system using Peirce's triadic relation show potential for further applications of the proposed triadic set and triadic logic. Alongside, a classical AI game-The Wumpus World-is implemented to show practical efficacy in comparison with binary implementation. Besides giving some preliminary formulations for trichotomous set theory and definition of finite automaton, development of hybrid architectures for intelligent agents and evolutionary computations are discussed as potential practical avenues for Peirce's triadic logic.;;;;Bakhshi, Asim D./AAZ-1697-2020;Bakhshi, Asim D./0000-0002-9516-9153;;;;;;;;;;;;0925-8531;1572-9583;;;;SEP;2019;28;3;;;;;389;426;;10.1007/s10849-019-09287-2;;;;;;;WOS:000481777000001;;;;;;

This article examines cinematic representations and imaginaries in order to understand the development of the self-driving technology and its integration in contemporary societies, drawing on examples such as The Love Bug, Knight Rider, Minority Report and I, Robot. Conceptually and methodologically, the article combines close readings of films with technological concerns and theoretical considerations, in an attempt to grasp the entanglement of cinematographic imaginaries, audiovisual technologies, artificial intelligence and human interactions that characterise the introduction of self-driving cars in contemporary societies. The human-Al machine interaction is considered both on technological and theoretical levels.

However, despite an apparent agreement that AI should be 'ethical', there is debate about both what constitutes 'ethical AI' and which ethical requirements, technical standards and best practices are needed for its realization. To investigate whether a global agreement on these questions is emerging, we mapped and analysed the current corpus of principles and guidelines on ethical AI. Our results reveal a global convergence emerging around five ethical principles (transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy), with substantive divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted, why they are deemed important, what issue, domain or actors they pertain to, and how they should be implemented. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating guideline-development efforts with substantive ethical analysis and adequate implementation strategies. As AI technology develops rapidly, it is widely recognized that ethical guidelines are required for safe and fair implementation in society. But is it possible to agree on what is 'ethical AI'? A detailed analysis of 84 AI ethics reports around the world, from national and international organizations, companies and institutes, explores this question, finding a convergence around core principles but substantial divergence on practical implementation.;;;;;Jobin, Anna/0000-0002-4649-7812;;;;;;;;;;;;;2522-5839;;;;SEP;2019;1;9;;;;;389;399;;10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2;;;;;;;WOS:000571252900003;;;;;;

Stanley; Xia, Qiangfei; Yang, J. Joshua";;;In situ training of feed-forward and recurrent convolutional memristor networks;NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE;;;;;;;;;;;;The explosive growth of machine learning is largely due to the recent advancements in hardware and architecture. The engineering of network structures, taking advantage of the spatial or temporal translational isometry of patterns, naturally leads to bio-inspired, shared-weight structures such as convolutional neural networks, which have markedly reduced the number of free parameters. State-of-the-art microarchitectures commonly rely on weight-sharing techniques, but still suffer from the von Neumann bottleneck of transistor-based platforms. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the in situ training of a five-level convolutional neural network that self-adapts to non-idealities of the one-transistor one-memristor array to classify the MNIST dataset, achieving similar accuracy to the memristor-based multilayer perceptron with a reduction in trainable parameters of similar to 75% owing to the shared weights. In addition, the memristors encoded both spatial and temporal translational invariance simultaneously in a convolutional long short-term memory network-a memristor-based neural network with intrinsic 3D input processing-which was trained in situ to classify a synthetic MNIST sequence dataset using just 850 weights. These proof-of-principle demonstrations combine the architectural advantages of weight sharing and the area/energy efficiency boost of the memristors, paving the way to future edge artificial intelligence.;;;;"wang, zhongrui/K-3043-2018; Li, Can/L-1011-2018";"wang, zhongrui/0000-0003-2264-0677; Li, Can/0000-0003-3795-2008";;;;;;;;;;;;;2522-5839;;;;SEP;2019;1;9;;;;;434;442;;10.1038/s42256-019-0089-1;;;;;;;WOS:000571252900007;;;;;;

J;Ishii, K;;;;Ishii, Kaori;;;Comparative legal study on privacy and personal data protection for robots equipped with artificial intelligence: looking at functional and technological aspects;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;This paper undertakes a comparative legal study to analyze the challenges of privacy and personal data protection posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) embedded in Robots, and to offer policy suggestions. After identifying the benefits from various AI usages and the risks posed by AI-related technologies, I then analyze legal frameworks and relevant discussions in the EU, USA, Canada, and Japan, and further consider the efforts of Privacy by Design (PbD) originating in Ontario, Canada. While various AI usages provide great convenience, many issues, including profiling, discriminatory decisions, lack of transparency, and impeding consent, have emerged. The unpredictability arising from the AI machine learning function poses further difficulties, which have only been partially addressed by legal frameworks in the aforementioned jurisdictions. However, analyzing the relevant discussions yielded several suggestions. The first priority is adopting PbD as the most flexible, soft-legal, and preferable approach toward AI-oriented issues. Implementing PbD will protect individual privacy and personal data without specific efforts, and achieve both the development of AI and the advancement of privacy and personal data protection. Technical measures that can adapt to an individual's dynamic choices according to the context should be further developed. Furthermore, alternative technical measures, including those to solve the algorithmic black box or achieve differential privacy, warrant thorough examination. If AI surpasses human intelligence, a terminating function, such as a kill switch will be the last resort to preserve individual choice. Despite numerous difficulties, we must prepare for the coming AI-prevalent society by taking a flexible approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;SEP;2019;34;3;;;;;509;533;;10.1007/s00146-017-0758-8;;;;;;;WOS:000480548600008;;;;;;
J;"Johnson, DG; Verdicchio, M";;;;"Johnson, Deborah G.; Verdicchio, Mario";;;AI, agency and responsibility: the VW fraud case and beyond;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;The concept of agency as applied to technological artifacts has become an object of heated debate in the context of AI research because some AI researchers ascribe to programs the type of agency traditionally associated with humans. Confusion about agency is at the root of misconceptions about the possibilities for future AI. We introduce the concept of a triadic agency that includes the causal agency of artifacts and the intentional agency of humans to better describe what happens in AI as it functions in real-world contexts. We use the VW emission fraud case to explain triadic agency since in this case a technological artifact, namely software, was an essential part of the wrongdoing and the software might be said to have agency in the wrongdoing. We then extend the case to include futuristic AI, imagining AI that becomes more and more autonomous.;;;;Verdicchio, Mario/AAJ-4038-2020;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;SEP;2019;34;3;;;;;639;647;;10.1007/s00146-017-0781-9;;;;;;;WOS:000480548600018;;;;;;

Seeing - as a position from a singular mode of observation - has become problematic since many visual elements, techniques, and forms of observing are highly distributed through data practices of collection, analysis and prediction. Such practices are subtended by visual cultural techniques that are grounded in the development of image collections, image formatting and hardware design. In this article, we analyze recent transformations in forms of prediction and data analytics associated with spectacular performances of computation. We analyze how transformations in the collection and accumulation of images as ensembles by platforms have a qualitative and material effect on the emergent sociotechnicality of platform 'life' and 'perception'. Reconstructing the visual transformations that allow artificial intelligence assemblages to operate allows some sense of their heteronomous materiality and contingency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0263-2764;1460-3616;;;;SEP;2019;36;5;;;;;3;22;;10.1177/0263276419847508;;;;;;;WOS:000480256600001;;;;;;

Field tests were conducted on three soil textures and obtained results were analyzed by application of a factorial experiment based on a Randomized Complete Block Design with five replications. The four independent variables of percentage of soil moisture content, soil bulk density, electrical conductivity and sampling depth were used to predict soil cone index by ANNs, ANFIS and a regression model. The ANNs design was that of back propagation multilayer networks. Predictions of soil cone index with ANFIS were made using the hybrid learning model. Comparison of results acquired from ANNs, ANFIS and regression models showed that the ANFIS model could predict soil cone index values more accurately than ANNs and regression models. Considering the ANFIS model, a novel result on soil compaction modeling, relative error (epsilon), and regression coefficient (R-2) were calculated at 2.54% and 0.979, respectively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1335-2555;1338-5267;;;;SEP;2019;22;3;;;;;80;85;;10.2478/ata-2019-0015;;;;;;;WOS:000480429800003;;;;;;

It shall refer to modeling the human ability to draw meaningful conclusions despite incomplete and inconsistent knowledge involving among others the representation of knowledge where all processes from the acquisition and update of knowledge to the derivation of conclusions must be implementable and executable on appropriate hardware.

The article analyzes biometrics, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain as part of a technological assemblage, which I term the biometric assemblage. The article identifies five intersecting logics that explain wider transformations within the humanitarian sector and in turn shape the biometric assemblage. The acceleration of the rate of biometric registrations in the humanitarian sector between 2002 and 2019 reveals serious concerns regarding bias, data safeguards, data-sharing practices with states and commercial companies, experimentation with untested technologies among vulnerable people, and, finally, ethics. Technological convergence amplifies risks associated with each constituent technology of the biometric assemblage. The article finally argues that the biometric assemblage accentuates asymmetries between refugees and humanitarian agencies and ultimately entrenches inequalities in a global context.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1527-4764;1552-8316;;;;SEP;2019;20;6;;;SI;;581;599;;10.1177/1527476419857682;;;;;;;WOS:000479295400004;;;;;;

Recent Findings Healthcare institutions are rapidly scaling up telehealth programs and embracing long-distance consultation. New developments in deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence, have reached dermatologist-level performance in diagnosing cases of melanoma from lesion images. The smartphone industry projects that next-generation devices and widespread adoption will put deep learning-capable hardware in the hands of consumers everywhere in the coming decade. Summary The expansion in teledermatology programs over the past decade is driven by efforts to lower cost of care, expand access to underserved areas, and improve the monitoring of chronic conditions. Although long-distance diagnosis still underperforms relative to traditional, in-person diagnosis, deep learning technologies have demonstrated the potential to achieve results on par with face-to-face care. Current mobile app diagnosis systems rely on unproven technologies which do not achieve the same standard of accuracy. Over the next few years, research in teledermatology must refine deep learning methods to work with highly variable smartphone images in order to achieve functional long-distance diagnoses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2162-4933;;;;;SEP;2019;8;3;;;;;85;90;;10.1007/s13671-019-0259-8;;;;;;;WOS:000477575500001;;;;;;

Recent Findings Major breakthroughs in recent years are likely related to advancements in utilization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for dermatologic image analysis, especially dermoscopy. Recent studies have shown that CNN-based approaches perform as well as or even better than human raters in diagnosing close-up and dermoscopic images of skin lesions in a simulated static environment. Several limitations for the development of AI include the need for large data pipelines and ground truth diagnoses, lack of metadata, and lack of rigorous widely accepted standards. Summary Despite recent breakthroughs, adoption of AI in clinical settings for dermatology is in early stages.

J;Heddam, S;;;;Heddam, Salim;;;Development of air-soil temperature model using computational intelligence paradigms: artificial neural network versus multiple linear regression;MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT;;;;;;;;;;;;A multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLPNN) model is proposed to estimate the soil temperature from air temperature. The results obtained using MLPNN are compared with those obtained using the multiple linear regression (MLR) using data measured at hourly time step. Firstly, the two models were developed and compared using only air temperature as input variable, and results obtained reveals that soil temperature can be estimated reliably with acceptable accuracy and the MLPNN was slightly more accurate than the MLR model. During the testing phase, the coefficient of correlation R, RMSE and MAE were calculated as 0.834, 7.476 degrees C, and 5.757 degrees C for the MLPNN model, while the MLR model provided an R, RMSE and MAE of 0.827, 7.646 degrees C and 6.039 degrees C. Secondly, in order to improve the accuracy of the models, the periodicity represented by the hours of the day number, the day of the month, and the month number, were included as input variable in addition to the air temperature. Results obtained demonstrated that the performances of the MLPNN model were significantly improved and the performances of the MLR model were marginally increased. Results demonstrated that MLPNN model is an excellent alternative to the direct measurement of soil temperature.;;;;HEDDAM, SALIM/B-8647-2015;HEDDAM, SALIM/0000-0002-8055-8463;;;;;;;;;;;;2363-6203;2363-6211;;;;SEP;2019;5;3;;;;;747;751;;10.1007/s40808-018-0565-3;;;;;;;WOS:000476822000001;;;;;;

While there are various types of problems in which it is applied, medical diagnosis is one of the most remarkable one among them. Moving from the explanations, objective of this study is to realize diabetes diagnosis by using intelligent optimization based Support Vector Machines (SVM). In this context, five ones of today's recent intelligent optimization algorithms were used for optimizing a non-linear SVM, which is using a Gaussian-RBF kernel function. Obtained findings showed that hybrid systems formed with different algorithms show different-level success but in general, good level accurate results can be achieved via intelligent optimization-SVM approach. Hereby, the study also confirms that this followed approach has a significant potential for Artificial Intelligence based diagnosis.;;;;Kose, Utku/C-8683-2009;Kose, Utku/0000-0002-9652-6415;;;;;;;;;;;;1302-0900;2147-9429;;;;SEP;2019;22;3;;;;;557;566;;10.2339/politeknik.418851;;;;;;;WOS:000475849300004;;;;;;
J;Calp, MH;;;;Calp, M. Hanefi;;;An Estimation of Personnel Food Demand Quantity for Businesses by Using Artificial Neural Networks;JOURNAL OF POLYTECHNIC-POLITEKNIK DERGISI;;;;;;;;;;;;Today, many public or private institutions provide professional food service for personnels working in their own organizations. Regarding the planning of the said service, there are some obstacles due to the fact that the number of the personnel working in the institutions is generally high and the personnel are out of the institution due to personal or institutional reasons. Because of this, it is difficult to determine the daily food demand, and this causes cost, time and labor loss for the institutions. Statistical or heuristic methods are used to remove or at least minimize these losses. In this study, an artificial intelligence model was proposed, which estimates the daily food demand quantity using artificial neural networks for businesses. The data are obtained from a refectory database of a private institution with a capacity of 110 people serving daily meals and serving at different levels, covering the last two years (2016-2018). The model was created using the MATLAB package program. The performance of the model was determinde by the Regression values, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the Mean Squared Error (MSE). In the training of the ANN model, feed forward back propagation network architecture is used. The best model obtained as a result of the experiments is a multi-layer (8-10-10-1) structure with a training R ratio of 0,9948, a testing R ratio of 0,9830 and an error rate of 0,003783, respectively. Experimental results demonstrated that the model has low error rate, high performance and positive effect of using artificial neural networks for demand estimating.;;;;CALP, M.

J;Barn, BS;;;;Barn, Balbir S.;;;Mapping the public debate on ethical concerns: algorithms in mainstream media;JOURNAL OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & ETHICS IN SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;Purpose Algorithms are in the mainstream media news on an almost daily basis. Their context is invariably artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning decision-making. In media articles, algorithms are described as powerful, autonomous actors that have a capability of producing actions that have consequences. Despite a tendency for deification, the prevailing critique of algorithms focuses on ethical concerns raised by decisions resulting from algorithmic processing. However, the purpose of this paper is to propose that the ethical concerns discussed are limited in scope and suggest that it is not clear what concerns dominate the debate. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses a systematic mapping study approach to review articles appearing in leading UK national papers from the perspective of the ethical concerns over a period of one year. The articles are categorised using a widely cited framework detailing a taxonomy of ethical concerns. The UK context is important because of UK public policy initiatives around AI. Findings The research presented in this paper contributes the first systematic mapping study of articles appearing in leading UK national papers from the perspective of widely accepted ethical concerns such as inscrutable evidence, misguided evidence, unfair outcomes and transformative effects. Originality/value The research presented in this paper contributes the first systematic mapping study of articles appearing in leading UK national papers from the perspective of the ethical concerns. The UK context is important because of UK public policy initiatives around AI.

J;Buckner, C;;;;Buckner, Cameron;;;Deep learning: A philosophical introduction;PHILOSOPHY COMPASS;;;;;;;;;;;;Absract Deep learning is currently the most prominent and widely successful method in artificial intelligence. Despite having played an active role in earlier artificial intelligence and neural network research, philosophers have been largely silent on this technology so far. This is remarkable, given that deep learning neural networks have blown past predicted upper limits on artificial intelligence performance-recognizing complex objects in natural photographs and defeating world champions in strategy games as complex as Go and chess-yet there remains no universally accepted explanation as to why they work so well. This article provides an introduction to these networks as well as an opinionated guidebook on the philosophical significance of their structure and achievements. It argues that deep learning neural networks differ importantly in their structure and mathematical properties from the shallower neural networks that were the subject of so much philosophical reflection in the 1980s and 1990s. The article then explores several different explanations for their success and ends by proposing three areas of inquiry that would benefit from future engagement by philosophers of mind and science.;;;;;Buckner, Cameron/0000-0003-0611-5354;;;;;;;;;;;;;1747-9991;;;;OCT;2019;14;10;;;;;;;e12625;10.1111/phc3.12625;;AUG 2019;;;;;WOS:000482260000001;;;;;;
J;Schalley, AC;;;;Schalley, Andrea C.;;;Ontologies and ontological methods in linguistics;LANGUAGE AND LINGUISTICS COMPASS;;;;;;;;;;;;In the last decade, linguists have started to develop and make use of ontologies, encouraged by the progress made in areas such as Artificial Intelligence and the Semantic Web. This paper gives an overview of notions and dimensions of ontology and of ontologies for and in linguistics. It discusses building blocks, design aspects, and capabilities of formal ontologies and provides some implementation pointers. The focus of this paper, however, is on linguistic research and what a modelling framework based on ontologies has to offer. Accordingly, the paper does not aim at providing an overview of specific models for computational processing. To illustrate the issues at hand, an example scenario from linguistic typology is selected instead, where the aim of describing the world's languages is approached through ontologies.;;;;;Schalley, Andrea/0000-0003-1323-1548;;;;;;;;;;;;1749-818X;;;;;NOV;2019;13;11;;;;;;;e12356;10.1111/lnc3.12356;;AUG 2019;;;;;WOS:000481882400001;;;;;;

The Reinforcement Learning agent interacts with the production system and learns the best actions for each state. The goal is to minimize the total, average cost that consists of holding and backorder costs. The Reinforcement Learning-based approach is compared to the standard CONWIP, the Dynamic CONWIP and a special case of the Generalized Kanban system in a series of simulation experiments. The proposed approach is found to outperform all alternative control policies in all cases. The Generalized Kanban policy is reported to be a good approximation of the control policies that are derived by the Reinforcement Learning approach in situations where the demand rate is low. A numerical investigation of the total cost function properties for the CONWIP, Dynamic CONWIP and Generalized Kanban is also provided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2168-1015;2168-1023;;;;AUG 18;2019;36;5;;;;;313;323;;10.1080/21681015.2019.1647301;;;;;;;WOS:000493554400005;;;;;;
J;Monajjemi, M;;;;Monajjemi, Majid;;;C-13-NMR sonification of human insulin: a method for conversion of amino-acid sequences to music notes;BIOINTERFACE RESEARCH IN APPLIED CHEMISTRY;;;;;;;;;;;;The concept of molecular sonification comprises total steps of methods that convert the physical data derived from chemical systems into acousmatic music. NMR data of the C-13 are especially well suited data sources for Insulin sonification. Even though their resonant frequencies are typically in the MHz region, the resonant frequencies span around kHz. The human insulin is consisting of 51 amino acids which can be divided into 7 series of amino acids for seven octaves of notes. During NMR calculation with ab-initio methods, these signals are routinely mixed down into the audible frequencies ranges, rendering the need for any additional frequencies transpositions unnecessary. By this work, insulin protein sequences into musical notes to reveal auditory algorithms have been converted. Calculation and optimization of 20 amino acids have been done and the total frequencies of each amino acid have been converted to 20 music notes and distinguishing those using variations of chemical shifts including pitch, time duration length of notes and even rhythm have been accomplished.;;;;Monajjemi, Majid/F-6526-2017;Monajjemi, Majid/0000-0002-6665-837X;;;;;;;;;;;;2069-5837;;;;;AUG 15;2019;9;4;;;;;4077;4084;;10.33263/BRIAC94.077084;;;;;;;WOS:000486974400015;;;;;;
J;Cukier, W;;;;Cukier, Wendy;;;Disruptive processes and skills mismatches in the new economy Theorizing social inclusion and innovation as solutions;JOURNAL OF GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY;;;;;;;;;;;;Purpose Analysts predict that disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, will have a monumental impact on the world of work in the coming decades, exacerbating existing skills gaps faster than education systems can adapt. This paper aims to review research on the forecasted impact of technology on labour markets and skill demands over the near term. Furthermore, it outlines how social innovations and inclusion can be leveraged as strategies to mitigate the predicted impact of disruptive technologies. Design/methodology/approach The paper engages in an overview of relevant academic literature, policy and industry reports focussing on disruptive technologies, labour market skills gaps and training to identify ongoing trends and prospective solutions. Findings This paper identifies an array of predictions, made in studies and reports, about the impact of disruptive technologies on labour markets. It outlines that even conservative estimates can be expected to considerably exacerbate existing skills gaps. In turn, it identifies work-integrated learning and technology-enabled talent matching platforms as tools, which could be used to mitigate the effects of disruptive technologies on labour markets. It argues that there is a need for rigorous evaluation of innovative programmes being piloted across jurisdictions. Research limitations/implications - This paper focusses on these dynamics primarily as they are playing out in Canada and similar Western countries. However, our review and conclusions are not generalizable to other regions and economies at different stages of development. Further work is needed to ascertain how disruptive technologies will affect alternative jurisdictions. Social implications - While future of work debates typically focus on technology and deterministic narratives, this paper points out that social innovations in training and inclusive technologies could prove useful in helping societies cope with the labour market effects of disruptive technologies. Originality/value This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the existing literature on the labour market effects of novel technologies. It contributes original insights into the future of work debates by outlining how social innovation and inclusion can be used as tools to address looming skills mismatches over the short to medium term.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2041-2568;2041-2576;;;;AUG 15;2019;10;3;;;SI;;211;225;;10.1108/JGR-11-2018-0079;;;;;;;WOS:000482124300003;;;;;;
J;"Thomas, TA; Ray, K";;;;"Thomas, Tessa A.; Ray, Korok";;;Online outsourcing and the future of work;JOURNAL OF GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY;;;;;;;;;;;;"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide an argument supporting the growth of online outsourcing, which will exponentially increase in the coming years with the spread of internet availability to the less-developed regions of the world. In addition, this paper stresses the role of human decision-making in fostering this growth, rather than promoting inhibitory policies because of nationalism or fear of change. Design/methodology/approach First, globalization and the three waves of outsourcing are discussed. Next, the economic principles guiding online outsourcing (disintermediation, the rise of global internet connectivity and the benefits of output-based pay over input-based pay) are discussed. After explaining how artificial intelligence will complement rather than replace human laborers, a case study and evidence are provided. Then, suggestions for government policies going forward, including skill development and education are provided. Finally, the debate that will inevitably emerge regarding online worker benefits is introduced. Findings Evidence points toward the growth of online outsourcing and the resulting increased efficiency and gains through this type of trade. The increase in freelance workers and their earnings, the investments of Google and Facebook to develop internet capabilities in less-developed regions and the reducing costs of technology (such as laptops) provide support for this argument (Elance, 2013; Forbes, 2014; Pofeldt, 2015). Finally, a case study provides evidence illustrating how individuals may gain from these advances. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature by providing a compelling argument for the upcoming transition to increased efficiency in work through online outsourcing. Technological advances will allow the modern worker to delegate his/her mundane tasks so that he/she is free to focus on more pressing issues. This shift will multiply the domestic and foreign labor markets, creating opportunities that have not been available to this point. As this transition is not inevitable, this paper further outlines suggestions for policymakers to ensure maximized gains in the future.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2041-2568;2041-2576;;;;AUG 15;2019;10;3;;;SI;;226;238;;10.1108/JGR-10-2018-0039;;;;;;;WOS:000482124300004;;;;;;

The introduction of artificial intelligence, especially machine learning algorithms, has made it possible to design more effective RO strategies. However, the model trained by current machine learning algorithms is only suitable for specific scenarios, and cannot be applied to new scenarios, resulting in the need to retrain the models in the new scenario and increase the training costs. Transfer learning (TL) can solve this problem by collecting a small amount of training data in the new scenario and strengthening the existing related models. This paper proposes a RO strategy for resource reservation based on TL in SDM-EONs. If the AR requests fail to reserve resources, TL will be used to predict the spectrum defragmentation time to complete the resource optimization before their start time. For the IR requests, they will occupy the low-level AR requests with the latest start time. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can decrease the probability for resource reservation failure and improve the resource utilization.;;;;;Yu, Ao/0000-0002-1520-1097;;;;;;;;;;;;0733-8724;1558-2213;;;;AUG 15;2019;37;16;;;;;4164;4172;;10.1109/JLT.2019.2902454;;;;;;;WOS:000478943700034;;;;;;
J;Aaronson, SA;;;;Aaronson, Susan Ariel;;;Data is different, and that's why the world needs a new approach to governing cross-border data flows;DIGITAL POLICY REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE;;;;;;;;;;;;Purpose Companies, governments and individuals are using data to create new services such as apps, artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). These data-driven services rely on large pools of data and a relatively unhindered flow of data across borders (few market access or governance barriers). The current approach to governing cross-border data flows through trade agreements and has not led to binding, universal or interoperable rules governing the use of data. The purpose of this article is to explain the new role of data in trade and to explain why data in trade is different from trade in other goods and services. We then suggest a new approach at the national and international levels. Design/methodology/approach The author uses a mixed methods approach to examine what the literature says about data as a traded good and or service, examines metaphors regarding the role of data in the economy, and then examines whether or not data is really traded. Findings Many countries do not know how to regulate data driven services. There is no consensus on what the appropriate regulatory environment looks like, nor is there a consensus on what are the barriers to cross-border data flows and what constitutes legitimate domestic regulation. Originality/value This is the first article to explain both the unique nature of data and the ineffectiveness of the trade system to address that distinctiveness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2398-5038;2398-5046;;;;AUG 12;2019;21;5;;;;;441;460;;10.1108/DPRG-03-2019-0021;;;;;;;WOS:000487249200001;;;;;;
J;Maouche, S;;;;Maouche, Seraya;;;Google AI: Opportunities, Risks, and Ethical Challenges;CONTEMPORARY FRENCH AND FRANCOPHONE STUDIES;;;;;;;;;;;;Emerging technologies (ET) are novel and relatively fast-growing technologies that can have massive socio-economic impact and bring new ethical and regulatory challenges. Although they cannot be considered as new technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and related data driven technologies are examples of ET. AI is advancing at a rapid pace, in both public and private sectors, and being more widely deployed in different domains, including healthcare and education. In today's digital age, our societies are facing rapid and massive technological transformations. It is important to ensure that the behavior of AI systems is beneficial to humanity. Policymakers and the research community need to identify the greatest barriers to AI adoption and related risks. In recent years, Google's plans and visions to use ET gained serious and intense criticism. This situation pushed Google in March 2019 to announce an AI ethics panel which is supposed to offer guidance on ethical issues relating to AI, machine learning, and related technologies. This AI ethics panel was shut down just days after it was launched. The episode illustrates how ethical debates relating to ET are often characterized by ambiguity, dishonesty, and demagoguery. In this paper, I discuss the ethics of ET, focusing on Google and its AI platform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1740-9292;1740-9306;;;;AUG 8;2019;23;4;;;SI;;447;455;;10.1080/17409292.2019.1705012;;;;;;;WOS:000521119500009;;;;;;
J;Constantine, P;;;;Constantine, Peter;;;Google Translate Gets Voltaire: Literary Translation and the Age of Artificial Intelligence;CONTEMPORARY FRENCH AND FRANCOPHONE STUDIES;;;;;;;;;;;;In the fall of 2016, users of Google Translate working from French to English and English to French saw a marked improvement in the quality of the translated texts. Google Translate was beginning to develop from a purely phrase-based statistical machine translation system into a system that uses deep learning and artificial neural networks that can adapt and learn in reaction to all they encounter. The Google Translate development team has been working on expanding and strengthening the system's capability of pragmatic analysis. This capability entails extracting useful information from a text so that its meaning can be accurately inferred in an attempt to overcome the vagueness and ambiguity inherent in language, which have remained the greatest hurdles to effective machine translation. This article explores the potential of Google Translate to provide increasingly competent translations of literary texts. Using passages from the works of Voltaire translated by Google Translate into English, this article explores both the successes and the ongoing problems faced by new generations of Google Translate, and of machine translation systems in general, as their developers seek to overcome the hurdles of identifying and rendering style, nuance, and ambiguity in language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1740-9292;1740-9306;;;;AUG 8;2019;23;4;;;SI;;471;479;;10.1080/17409292.2019.1694798;;;;;;;WOS:000521119500012;;;;;;

Participants were either told or shown how the autoparking feature worked. Results showed a significantly higher initial driver intervention rate when the participants were only told how to employ the autoparking feature, than when shown. However, the intervention rate quickly leveled off, and differences between conditions disappeared. The number of interventions and the distances from the parking anchoring point (a trashcan) were used to create a new measure of distrust in autonomy. Eyetracking measures revealed that participants disengaged from monitoring the center display as the experiment progressed, which could be a further indication of a lowering of distrust in the system. Combined, these results have important implications for development and design of explainable artificial intelligence and autonomous systems. Finally, we detail the substantial hurdles encountered while trying to evaluate autonomy in the wild. Our research highlights the need to re-evaluate trust concepts in high-risk, high-consequence environments.;;;;;Tenhundfeld, Nathan/0000-0002-3753-8096;;;;;;;;;;;;1555-3434;2169-5032;;;;DEC;2019;13;4;;;SI;;279;294;1,55534E+15;10.1177/1555343419869083;;AUG 2019;;;;;WOS:000480268600001;;;;;;

J;Wendin, G;;;;Wendin, Goran;;;Can Biological Quantum Networks Solve NP-Hard Problems?;ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES;;;;;;;;;;;;There is a widespread view that the human brain is so complex that it cannot be efficiently simulated by universal Turing machines, let alone ordinary classical computers. During the last decades the question has therefore been raised whether it is needed to consider quantum effects to explain the imagined cognitive power of a conscious mind. Not surprisingly, the conclusion is that quantum-enhanced cognition and intelligence are very unlikely to be found in biological brains. Quantum effects may certainly influence signaling pathways at the molecular level in the brain network, like ion ports, synapses, sensors, and enzymes. This might evidently influence the functionality of some nodes and perhaps even the overall intelligence of the brain network, but hardly give it any dramatically enhanced functionality. The conclusion is that biological quantum networks can only approximately solve small instances of nonpolynomial (NP)-hard problems. On the other hand, artificial intelligence and machine learning implemented in complex dynamical systems based on genuine quantum networks can certainly be expected to show enhanced performance and quantum advantage compared with classical networks. Nevertheless, even quantum networks can only be expected to solve NP-hard problems approximately. In the end it is a question of precision-Nature is approximate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2511-9044;;;;AUG;2019;2;7-8;;;SI;;;;UNSP 1800081;10.1002/qute.201800081;;;;;;;WOS:000548079200006;;;;;;

I also concede that, on some conceptions of autonomy, it is possible to build human-level AI servants that will enjoy full-blown autonomy.

We aimed to develop and validate a three-dimensional (3D) deep-learning system using SDOCT volumes to detect glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Methods We retrospectively collected a dataset including 4877 SDOCT volumes of optic disc cube for training (60%), testing (20%), and primary validation (20%) from electronic medical and research records at the Chinese University of Hong Kong Eye Centre (Hong Kong, China) and the Hong Kong Eye Hospital (Hong Kong, China). Residual network was used to build the 3D deep-learning system. Three independent datasets (two from Hong Kong and one from Stanford, CA, USA), including 546, 267, and 1231 SDOCT volumes, respectively, were used for external validation of the deep-learning system. Volumes were labelled as having or not having glaucomatous optic neuropathy according to the criteria of retinal nerve fibre layer thinning on reliable SDOCT images with position-correlated visual field defect. Heatmaps were generated for qualitative assessments. Findings 6921 SDOCT volumes from 1 384 200 two-dimensional cross-sectional scans were studied. The 3D deep-learning system had an area under the receiver operation characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.969 (95% CI 0.960-0.976), sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 83-93), specificity of 96% (92-99), and accuracy of 91% (89-93) in the primary validation, outperforming a two-dimensional deep-learning system that was trained on en face fundus images (AUROC 0.921 [0.905-0.937]; p<0.0001). The 3D deep-learning system performed similarly in the external validation datasets, with AUROCs of 0.893-0.897, sensitivities of 78-90%, specificities of 79-86%, and accuracies of 80-86%. The heatmaps of glaucomatous optic neuropathy showed that the learned features by the 3D deep-learning system used for detection of glaucomatous optic neuropathy were similar to those used by clinicians. Interpretation The proposed 3D deep-learning system performed well in detection of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in both primary and external validations. Further prospective studies are needed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of incorporation of an artificial intelligence-based model for glaucoma screening.

Discourse is one of the levels on which its existence and/or expression is usually studied and discussed. As subjectivity plays a central role in Discourse Analysis (DA), we consider it a potential determinant factor in the distinction between human and machine-generated discourse. However, the features of subjectivity expression in discourse are also the object of study of cognitive science, in which its neural correlates are moreover sought. It is, thus, highly relevant to include the cognitive perspective in the study of subjectivity by elaborating a synthesis of its contributions in this field at the levels DA considers constituents of subjectivity. It is the aim of this paper to present such a synthesis. In order to meet this aim, we proceed to the review of the cognitive approaches that take into account the features of subjectivity studied by DA. This way, we outline the trajectory of the concept of self in the above mentioned field and systematize the definitions suggested for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0718-4913;;;;;AUG;2019;14;1;;;;;36;42;;10.5839/rcnp.2019.14.01.05;;;;;;;WOS:000514301600005;;;;;;

The authors pay special attention to the conceptual meaning and consequences of the activists' use of the digital communication. Judging upon the theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of the activists' communication, the authors note that protest activity is seen as a reaction on the failure of communicative practices. But such an interpretation negates the constructive components typical for the current civil activity as a subject of communication of a new type. It is noted in the article that contemporary civil activity is based on the principles of a personal initiative inclusion rather than on a formal organizational membership like during the pre-digital era. Based on the ideas of the systemic communicative theory, the authors propose to consider civil activism as invariant communicative structures and note that activity's coordination is ensured by the discourse of activists' discussion or action. The authors claim that such a mechanism of coordination of the activists' organization could be interpreted as the priority of quasi-artificial intelligence in which specific neurons (that are represented by activists or discussion communities) communicate with discussion centers (these are network associations) through quasi-synaptic mechanisms (that are represented by the reaction to problems or events indicated in social networks). As it is noted in the article, if the reaction variety to digitally discussed events intensifies, several quasi-neural levels are formed (these are the levels of the network reaction to external network events, of the reaction to the reaction to non-network events, of active discussion). In turn, if activist unions are regularly disturbed by low-weight quasi-synaptic mechanisms (message of an insignificant or fake character), the protest communication reduces. The authors note that the horizontal rhizomatic structure of traditional activist movements, their decentralization and the low formalization of protest mobilization during the pre-digital era were objectively limited by the weak internal consolidation of associations. Asking a question about the conditions of network communities' coordination of their activity, the authors propose to reconstruct the activity of social networks by analogy with the structure of the organic nervous system or with the work of a complex mechanism. It is noted in the article that the network formed by the activist communication moves the internal logic of the participants' communication into a new more ordered format. It mainly concerns the making of collectively-binding decisions. The network mechanism of decision-making that is used by contemporary activist associations helps to compensate the deficit of central governance structures that was typical for the pre-digital era. As the authors note, the self-learning of the communicative system becomes possible due to the activist network's response to non-network events. That thus corresponds to the classical mechanisms of a positive feedback when more participation in activist actions generates a more active network's discussion of the actual context.;;;;"Barash, Raisa/P-1916-2014; Antonovskiy, Alexander/L-7762-2013";"Barash, Raisa/0000-0002-5899-973X; Antonovskiy, Alexander/0000-0003-4209-8213";;;;;;;;;;;;1998-863X;2311-2395;;;;AUG;2019;50;;;;;;5;20;;10.17223/1998863X/50/1;;;;;;;WOS:000500733100001;;;;;;

These devices when placed conformably on the human skin or any other artificial intelligence products must function in all their capacities to get a durable and highly sensitive device performance. Stretchable photodetectors are the core fundamental constituents that fall under the umbrella of flexible optoelectronic devices. Although a significant amount of research has been reported on stretchable photodetectors, good performance still remains a challenge. Nanometer-sized methylammonium lead bromide ((MA)-PbBr3) perovskite nanocrystals can significantly emit and absorb light in the visible spectrum. With high quantum yield and stable optical and electronic properties, when they are subjected to mechanically tunable two-dimensional (2D) composites, we obtain better performance from stretchable optoelectronic devices. Here, a hybrid photodetector composed of perovskite nanocrystals and graphene of rippled geometry is demonstrated, where a thin film of photon-absorbing perovskite nanocrystals is placed on rippled graphene that contributes to a photoresponsivity on the order of similar to 6 x 10(5) A W-1. The large photoresponsivity value places this hybrid stretchable device in the highest position among devices with similar functionality. It is found that the photoresponsivity of the perovskite nanocrystals and graphene hybrid rippled structure photodetector is strain tunable with a stretchability up to 100%. In addition, the hybrid rippled structure photodetector has wearability and durability. All of these superior functionalities lead the way toward fabricating stretchable optoelectronic devices suitable for applications in the fields of biomedicine, defense systems, fire detection, and flexible display panels.;;;;Wang, Wei-Hua/F-7911-2012;"Wang, Wei-Hua/0000-0003-1737-6648; Kataria, Monika/0000-0003-4912-340X";;;;;;;;;;;;2637-6113;;;;;AUG;2019;1;8;;;;;1517;1526;;10.1021/acsaelm.9b00308;;;;;;;WOS:000496315000021;;;;;;

Most of existing traditional medical systems are based on the knowledge of experts-doctors. In this thesis, the application of soft computing elements is considered to automate the process of diagnosing diseases, in particularly diagnosing of a heart attack. The research work will offer probable help to the medical practitioners and healthcare sector in making instantaneous resolution during the diagnosis of the diseases. The intelligent system will predict heart attacks from the patient dataset utilizing algorithms and help doctors in making diagnose of these illnesses. In this study, three techniques such as a neural network (back propagation), Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) and Adaptative Neuro-Fuzzy System (ANFIS) are considered for the design of the prediction system. The systems are designed using data sets. The data sets contain 1319 samples that includes 8 input attributes and one output. The output refers presence of a heart attack in the patient. For comparative analysis, the simulation results of the ANFIS model is compared with the simulation results of the neural network-based prediction model. The ANFIS model has shown better performance and outperformed NN based model.

Accordingly, researchers are currently comparing the significant amounts of data from Korea, China, and Japan. However, the amount of data required to be deciphered will gradually exceed human processing capabilities. The AI that employs character recognition technology is a 4IR technology that can be used to solve this problem. Hence, Japan developed the system MOJIZO in 2016, and the used it to decipher the text of ancient mokkan. Furthermore, in Korea, for each character, researchers are constructing primary data and secondary data in the form of databases. Thus, the development of an AI based mokkan deciphering system based on this data is required. Here, generalization by expanding the scope of the time and space of the training data can be achieved. However, understanding the context and comparing content are tasks that can only be completed by humans, the researchers of ancient history. The judgement of the researcher is required from the stage at which deciphering of training data for the AI. Korean ancient historical ruins are limited with respect to the invisibility of ruins. Therefore, as an alternative to actual restoration projects, VR and AR were employed for the restoration of ancient historical remains. However, until now, VR and AR content for Korean ancient historical remains were limited with respect to the authenticity of restoration, difficulty of simultaneous experience, absence of spatiality, and simplicity of information transmission. The solution of these issues requires the participation of expert researchers, the utilization of smartphones, and the application of VR content to history education and AR content in the sites of ruins. In particular, the ancient historical remains of the Anyang region were noted as an example in which VR and AR can be used to restore the various layers of time and space surrounding Anyangsaji (Chungch'osaji). VR and AR technologies are required for the restoration of the historicity of Anyangsaji, which also requires stages of academic research, restoration plan establishment, development, and utilization. Particularly, the participation of related experts is vital for storytelling and content authenticity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1598-2041;2508-5921;;;;AUG;2019;24;2;;;;;13;45;;10.22372/ijkh.2019.24.2.13;;;;;;;WOS:000486394900002;;;;;;

This article describes how Artificial Intelligence has been used since the 1980s to create translations and how it can be used to overcome the translation challenges that Korean historians face. It explains the work that the Institute for the Translation of Korean Classics has been doing to use Artificial Intelligence for the translation of historical Chinese texts, as well the current status of the work.

The advancement of big data technology will greatly transform these tasks, above all in collecting historical sources necessary for writing about our times. The collected data will include the type of materials that did not exist in the past. And it will be collected and used as a great historical source that enriches the historical writing and understanding of our times. Big data technology will also lead us to new methodologies for writing history, and this will require further research and development by research historians. Big data technology is advancing alongside AI technology. The role of AI will grow bigger and more pronounced in big data collection and analysis. However, it is important to note that collecting and analyzing big data still requires value judgments. In a deluge of data, historians must distinguish which are true and which are false; they have to filter through worthless data and find useful information. Moreover, researchers must take great pains to think about and persuade people regarding the use of personal information in the fierce controversy over privacy. This is an area that requires expertise and human judgment. The development of big data and artificial intelligence makes us realize that such objectivity and positivism should not stop at simply verifying the facts. The development of big data technology emphasizes the need for researchers to provide historical insights, ironically. It is now up to research historians to explore and search for different ways to write history by reaching beyond objectivity and positivism. Of course, historians are not the only ones to undertake this task; researchers in all disciplines must work together to find solutions.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1598-2041;2508-5921;;;;AUG;2019;24;2;;;;;99;131;;10.22372/ijkh.2019.24.2.99;;;;;;;WOS:000486394900005;;;;;;

At the core of IoT lies the early technology of radio frequency identification (RFID), which provides accurate location tracking of real-world objects. With its small size and convenience, RFID tags can be attached to everyday items such as books, clothes, furniture and the like as well as to animals, plants, and even humans. This phenomenon is the beginning of new applications and services for the industry and consumer market. IoT is regarded as a fourth industrial revolution because of its massive coverage of services around the world from smart homes to artificial intelligence-enabled smart driving cars, Internet-enabled medical equipment, etc. It is estimated that there will be several dozens of billions of IoT devices ready and operating until 2020 around the world. Despite the growing statistics, however, IoT has security vulnerabilities that must be addressed appropriately to avoid causing damage in the future. As such, we mention some fields of study as a future topic at the end of the survey.

Modern AI capabilities likewise offer an opportunity to dramatically improve the patent system. The patent systems of the world play a critical role in the global economy; strategic utilization of AI technology could bolster the innovative activity that patent systems support. Some straightforward uses of AI would be to assist the patent office in determining whether applications for patents should be granted or denied. Specially designed AI software could assist patent office examiners by finding relevant prior art, summarizing patent disclosures for efficient review, and helping to interpret difficult patent claim language. The increase in examination productivity could benefit users of the patent office by reducing fees, processing time, and error rates. Some less apparent possibilities for AI could provide new services to society. For example, AI could serve the public by summarizing the teachings of patent documents and automatically answering technical questions using information contained in millions of patent documents. While general-purpose AI techniques have many productive uses, AI techniques tailored to the problem domain have greater promise. Developing AI capabilities specifically optimized for the patent system will require significant research and experimentation. Carnegie Mellon University has launched a new center to help develop this nascent field. The Center for AI and Patent Analysis is an interdisciplinary initiative with a twofold mission. It conducts original research on AI tools and techniques to serve various users of the patent system.

Socio-cultural situations are one challenging area in which autonomous intelligent agents can acquire new knowledge or modify existing one. Socio-cultural situations can be best represented in the form of cognitive scripts that can allow different techniques to be used to facilitate knowledge transfer between scripts. Conceptual blending has proven successful in enhancing the social dynamics of cognitive scripts, where information is transferred from similar contextual scripts to a target script resulting in a new blended script. To the extent of our knowledge, there is no computational model available to evaluate these newly generated cognitive scripts. This work aims to develop a computational model to evaluate cognitive scripts resulting from blending two or more linear cognitive scripts. The evaluation process involves: 1) using the GloVe similarity to check if the transferred events conceptually fit the target script; 2) using the semantic view of text coherence to decide on the optimal position(s) to place the transferred event(s) in the target script. Results show that the GloVe similarity can be applied successfully to preserve the contextual meaning of cognitive scripts. Additional results show that GloVe embedding gives higher accuracy over Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) and Smooth Inverse Frequency (SIF) embedding but this comes with a high computational cost. Future work will look into reducing the computational cost and enhancing the accuracy.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2158-107X;2156-5570;;;;AUG;2019;10;8;;;;;333;340;;;;;;;;;WOS:000485681800044;;;;;;

YOLO framework has been trained with a modified configuration BCCD Dataset of blood smear images to automatically identify and count red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Moreover, this study with other convolutional neural network architectures considering architecture complexity, reported accuracy, and running time with this framework and compare the accuracy of the models for blood cells detection. They also tested the trained model on smear images from a different dataset and found that the learned models are generalised. Overall the computer-aided system of detection and counting enables us to count blood cells from smear images in less than a second, which is useful for practical applications.;;;;Islam, Mohammad Tariqul/M-7377-2016;Islam, Mohammad Tariqul/0000-0002-4929-3209;;;;;;;;;;;;;2053-3713;;;;AUG;2019;6;4;;;;;103;108;;10.1049/htl.2018.5098;;;;;;;WOS:000484660000004;31531224;;;;;
J;Chang, YC;;;;Chang, Yuchou;;;Improving the Otsu method for MRA image vessel extraction via resampling and ensemble learning;HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY LETTERS;;;;;;;;;;;;Accurate extraction of vessels plays an important role in assisting diagnosis, treatment, and surgical planning. The Otsu method has been used for extracting vessels in medical images. However, blood vessels in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) image are considered as a sparse distribution. Pixels on vessels in MRA image are considered as an imbalanced data in classification of vessels and non-vessel tissues. To extract vessels accurately, a novel method using resampling technique and ensemble learning is proposed for solving the imbalanced classification problem. Each pixel is sampled multiple times through multiple local patches within the image. Then, vessel or non-vessel tissue is determined by the ensemble voting mechanism via a p-tile algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to outperform the traditional Otsu method by extracting vessels in MRA images more accurately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2053-3713;;;;AUG;2019;6;4;;;;;115;120;;10.1049/htl.2018.5031;;;;;;;WOS:000484660000006;31531226;;;;;

Here, AI-based chatbot systems can act as automated conversational agents, capable of promoting health, providing education, and potentially prompting behaviour change. Exploring the motivation to use health chatbots is required to predict uptake; however, few studies to date have explored their acceptability. This research aimed to explore participants' willingness to engage with AI-led health chatbots. Methods The study incorporated semi-structured interviews (N-29) which informed the development of an online survey (N-216) advertised via social media. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. A survey of 24 items explored demographic and attitudinal variables, including acceptability and perceived utility. The quantitative data were analysed using binary regressions with a single categorical predictor. Results Three broad themes: 'Understanding of chatbots', 'AI hesitancy' and 'Motivations for health chatbots' were identified, outlining concerns about accuracy, cyber-security, and the inability of AI-led services to empathise. The survey showed moderate acceptability (67%), correlated negatively with perceived poorer IT skills OR = 0.32 [CI95%:0.13-0.78] and dislike for talking to computers OR = 0.77 [CI95%:0.60-0.99] as well as positively correlated with perceived utility OR = 5.10 [CI95%:3.08-8.43], positive attitude OR = 2.71 [CI95%:1.77-4.16] and perceived trustworthiness OR = 1.92 [CI95%:1.13-3.25]. Conclusion Most internet users would be receptive to using health chatbots, although hesitancy regarding this technology is likely to compromise engagement. Intervention designers focusing on AI-led health chatbots need to employ user-centred and theory-based approaches addressing patients' concerns and optimising user experience in order to achieve the best uptake and utilisation. Patients' perspectives, motivation and capabilities need to be taken into account when developing and assessing the effectiveness of health chatbots.";;;;;"Nadarzynski, Tom/0000-0001-7010-5308; Miles, Oliver/0000-0002-3214-2244";;;;;;;;;;;;2055-2076;;;;;AUG;2019;5;;;;;;;;2,05521E+15;10.1177/2055207619871808;;;;;;;WOS:000483763600001;31467682;;;;;

Adversarial attacks against artificial intelligence models become inevitable problems when there is a lack of research on the cross-site scripting (XSS) attack detection model for defense against attacks. It is extremely important to design a method that can effectively improve the detection model against attack. In this paper, we present a method based on reinforcement learning (called RLXSS), which aims to optimize the XSS detection model to defend against adversarial attacks. First, the adversarial samples of the detection model are mined by the adversarial attack model based on reinforcement learning. Secondly, the detection model and the adversarial model are alternately trained. After each round, the newly-excavated adversarial samples are marked as a malicious sample and are used to retrain the detection model. Experimental results show that the proposed RLXSS model can successfully mine adversarial samples that escape black-box and white-box detection and retain aggressive features. What is more, by alternately training the detection model and the confrontation attack model, the escape rate of the detection model is continuously reduced, which indicates that the model can improve the ability of the detection model to defend against attacks.;;;;;Huang, Cheng/0000-0002-5871-946X;;;;;;;;;;;;;1999-5903;;;;AUG;2019;11;8;;;;;;;177;10.3390/fi11080177;;;;;;;WOS:000482944400009;;;;;;

Data scientists have long struggled to maintain the quality of a dataset for machine learning by an AI entity. Datasets can be very expensive to purchase, as, depending on both the proper selection of the elements and the homogeneity of the data contained within, constructing and maintaining the integrity of a dataset is difficult. Blockchain as a highly secure storage medium presents a technological quantum leap in maintaining data integrity. Furthermore, blockchain's immutability constructs a fruitful environment for creating high quality, permanent and growing datasets for deep learning.

Therefore, research articles mainly deal with the design of new ODR solutions, without researching the social aspects of using different kinds of ODR solutions. For this reason, the main aim of the article is an empirical evaluation of two kinds of ODR solutions in business-to-business (B2B) relationships from the perspective of a selected social category. The article focuses on: (1) comparing unassisted and smart assisted negotiation while using the artificial intelligence approach; (2) the satisfaction and attitudes of Generation Y members from the Czech and Slovak Republic towards different ways of negotiating. The conclusions of this study can help researchers to design or improve existing ODR solutions, and companies to choose the most suitable managers from Generation Y for B2B negotiation. The results show that Generation Y members prefer computer-mediated communication as compared to face to face negotiation; the participants were more satisfied with the negotiation process when using smart assisted negotiation. Through a computer-mediated negotiation, even sellers with lower emotional stability can maintain an advantageous position. Similarly, buyers with lower agreeableness or higher extraversion can negotiate more favorable terms and offset their loss.";;;;"Simkova, Nikola/V-8092-2017; Smutny, Zdenek/L-7498-2016";"Simkova, Nikola/0000-0002-6390-1872; Smutny, Zdenek/0000-0002-6646-2991";;;;;;;;;;;;;2078-2489;;;;AUG;2019;10;8;;;;;;;263;10.3390/info10080263;;;;;;;WOS:000482973600007;;;;;;

The explosive revolution in multimedia research leads to the need for expanding the utility of texts in a machine vision environment to promote web search operation. Hence, extracting text from images forms the core aspect of information retrieval-based intelligent system. This article is aimed towards extracting text from unconstrained environments.

Consequently, it may result in economic losses and/or a rise of the operational cost, because most of the times the process will need to be interrupted. Therefore, the concern with the quality and security of the processes has stimulating studies of diagnosis and monitoring failures in industrial equipments. In light of this, the present article has as purpose to apply three different methods (Artificial Neural Networks - ANN, Fuzzy Logic - FL and Support Vector Machine - SVM). All of those were applied as detection and classification systems of failure in the processes of a case study in order to diagnose these artificial intelligence techniques so that the efficiency of each method can be compared. All investigation is done by modeling a reactor of Van der Vusse's kinetic causing four types of failures, in the concentration of a reagent (failure 1), in the sensor which measures the concentration of the interested product and temperature (failure 2 and 3), and in the valve locking (failure 4). The data used in this methodology is based in quantitative and qualitative historical information. All methods are able to detect failures, but in different times. ANN is the one which detects faster all the failures. SVM detects some minutes later, however with good precision, even though this method uses less computational effort compared to ANN. Fuzzy, in the most of the cases studied, takes hours to detect any change in the system, which makes this one the less effective among the ones studied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1806-0374;2179-0302;;;;AUG;2019;16;32;;;;;61;68;;;;;;;;;WOS:000482205600008;;;;;;

Their importance generated along-lasting debate on which connecting factor is betterand which one is compatible with internal market rules. However, technological developments and digitalisation shed a different light on this discussion. In order to understand how the current developments impact the discussion on company law connecting factors, it should first be clear what is really understood by connecting factors in the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. It is important to understand the relationship between substantive company law rules and those on conflict of laws. The outcome of the above analysis allows to add the digitalisation/new technologies factor into the equation. In this context, a closer look is given at the use of artificial intelligence applications in company law and the operation of a decentralised autonomous organisation within a blockchain network.

Transparency regarding training data, test data and results, interpretation of study results, and the sharing of algorithms and data are major areas for guaranteeing ethical standards in AI research. For transparency in training data, clarifying the biases and errors in training data and the AI algorithms based on these training data prior to their implementation is critical. Furthermore, biases about institutions and socioeconomic groups should be considered. For transparency in test data and test results, authors should state if the test data were collected externally or internally and prospectively or retrospectively at first. It is necessary to distinguish whether datasets were convenience samples consisting of some positive and some negative cases or clinical cohorts. When datasets from multiple institutions were used, authors should report results from each individual institution. Full publication of the results of AI research is also important. For transparency in interpreting study results, authors should interpret the results explicitly and avoid over-interpretation. For transparency by sharing algorithms and data, sharing is required for replication and reproducibility of the research by other researchers. All of the above mentioned high standards regarding transparency of AI research in healthcare should be considered to facilitate the ethical conduct of AI research.;;;;Park, Seong Ho/E-2271-2014;"Park, Seong Ho/0000-0002-1257-8315; Yoo, Soyoung/0000-0002-2953-508X";;;;;;;;;;;;2288-7474;2288-8063;;;;AUG;2019;6;2;;;;;91;98;;10.6087/kcse.164;;;;;;;WOS:000481664700002;;;;;;

In this study, artificial intelligence was applied to develop a proxy for layperson assessments, and compare sensitivity to existing outcome measures. Methods: Artificially intelligent emotion detection software was used to develop the emotionality quotient. The emotionality quotient was defined as the percentage probability of perceived joy over the percentage probability of perceived negative emotions during smiling, as predicted by the software. The emotionality quotient was used to analyze the emotionality of voluntary smiles of normal subjects and unilateral facial palsy patients before and after smile reanimation. The emotionality quotient was compared to oral commissure excursion and layperson assessments of facial palsy patients. Results: In voluntary smiles of 10 normal subjects, 100 percent joy and no negative emotion was detected (interquartile ranges, 0/1). Median preoperative emotionality quotient of 30 facial palsy patients was 15/-60 (interquartile range, 73/62). Postoperatively, median emotionality quotient was 84/0 (interquartile range, 28/5). In 134 smile reanimation patients, no correlation was found between postoperative oral commissure excursion and emotionality quotient score. However, in 61 preoperative patients, a moderate correlation was found between layperson-assessed disfigurement and negative emotion perception (correlation coefficient, 0.516; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Computer vision artificial intelligence software detected less joy and more negative emotion in smiles of facial palsy patients compared with normal subjects. Following smile reanimation, significantly more joy and less negative emotion were detected. The emotionality quotient was correlated with layperson assessments. The simplicity, sensitivity, and objectivity of the emotionality quotient render it an attractive tool to serve as a potential proxy for layperson assessment, an ideal outcome measure in facial palsy.";;;;"Dusseldorp, Joseph Richard/W-2485-2019; Guarin, Diego/AAF-1328-2019";"Dusseldorp, Joseph Richard/0000-0002-6392-7423; Jowett, Nate/0000-0002-5242-0264";;;;;;;;;;;;0032-1052;1529-4242;;;;AUG;2019;144;2;;;;;457;471;;10.1097/PRS.0000000000005865;;;;;;;WOS:000480746600066;31348360;;;;;

In this prospective, observational study, the authors aimed to delineate which plastic surgery-related topics evoked a significant emotional response within the study population and to assess the utility of motivational artificial intelligence within the field of plastic surgery. Methods: Over a 4-month period (January to April of 2018), Cognovi Lab's artificial intelligence technology was used to search and analyze emotional reactions to several commonly hashtagged words. This innovative software uses several key metrics to describe its findings, including awareness, engagement, and motivation. Results: Of the search terms examined, nose job had the most awareness during the study period, and the topic that most engaged consumers emotionally was liposuction. Interestingly, liposuction ranked only fifth in terms of awareness. Consumers showed the strongest positive motivation toward the subjects of plastic surgery and cosmetic surgery, and the lowest motivation toward the topic of tummy tucks. Conclusions: This analysis by Cognovi Labs is the first quantitative effort to use the plethora of data on social media to interpret patient motivations and subsequent behavior. Moving forward, artificial intelligence technology will make it possible to predict which plastic surgery products, procedures, and practices will be successful.

A pilot study is presented which aims to advance the (semi-)automatic difficulty scoring of grammar exercise items to be used in dynamic difficulty adaptation in an intelligent language tutoring system for practicing English tenses. In it, methods from item response theory and machine learning are combined with linguistic item analysis in order to calibrate the difficulty of an initial exercise pool of cued gap-filling items (CGFIs) and isolate CGFI features predictive of item difficulty. Multiple item features at the gap, context and CGFI levels are tested and relevant predictors are identified at all three levels. Our pilot regression models reach encouraging prediction accuracy levels which could, pending additional validation, enable the dynamic selection of newly generated items ranging from moderately easy to moderately difficult. The paper highlights further applications of the proposed methodology in the area of adapting language tutoring, item design and second language acquisition, and sketches out issues for future research.;;;;;Pandarova, Irina/0000-0003-1209-8511;;;;;;;;;;;;1560-4292;1560-4306;;;;AUG;2019;29;3;;;;;342;367;;10.1007/s40593-019-00180-4;;;;;;;WOS:000478671500002;;;;;;

CONTENT: Big data has arrived into medicine field, lead to potential enhancement in accountability, quality, efficiency, and innovation. Most updated, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning (ML) techniques rapidly developed, bring forth the big data analysis into more useful applications, from resource allocation to complex disease diagnosis. To realize this, a very large set of health-care data is needed for algorithms training and evaluation, including patients' treatment data, patients respond to treatment, and personal patient information, such as genetic data, family history, health behavior, and vital signs. SUMMARY: Precision Health involving preventive, predictive, personalized and precise. The arrival of AI and ML will enhance and facilitates the improvement of this relationship through better accuracy, productivity, and workflow, thus develop a health system that will go beyond just curing disease, but further into wellness that preventing disease before it strikes, thus the patient-doctor bond is expected to be reformed and not be eroded.;;;;Meiliana, Anna/ABC-9368-2020;;;;;;;;;;;;;2355-9179;;;;;AUG;2019;11;2;;;;;125;135;;10.18585/inabj.v11i2.844;;;;;;;WOS:000478574700002;;;;;;

The electronic health record (EHR) offers the potential for insight into real-world patient experiences and outcomes, but it is difficult to tap into. Our goal was to apply artificial intelligence technology to the EHR to characterize the clinical course of patients with stage III breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS Data from patients with stage III breast cancer who presented between 2013 and 2015 were extracted from the EHR, de-identified, and imported into the IBM Cloud. Specialized natural language processing (NLP) annotators were developed to extract medical concepts from unstructured clinical text and transform them to structured attributes. In the validation phase, these annotators were applied to 19 additional patients with stage III breast cancer from the same period. The resulting data were compared with that in the medical chart (gold standard) for nine key indicators. RESULTS Information was extracted for 50 patients, including tumor stage (94% stage IIIA, 6% stage IIIB), age (28% 50 years or younger, 52% between 51 and 70 years, and 24% older than 70 years), receptor status (84% estrogen receptor positive, 74% progesterone receptor positive), and first treatment (72% surgery, 26% chemotherapy, 2% endocrine). Events in the patient's journey were compiled to create a timeline. For 171 data elements, NLP and the chart disagreed for 41 (24%; 95% CI, 17.8% to 31.1%). With additional manipulation using simple logic, the disagreement was reduced to six elements (3.5%; 95% CI, 1.3% to 7.5%; F1 statistic, 0.9694). CONCLUSION It is possible to extract, read, and combine data from the EHR to view the patient journey. The agreement between NLP and the gold standard was high, which supports validity.

However, these models suffer the shortcomings of static nature, inability of self-evolution, and lack of adaptivity. Also, AR models cannot be made comprehensive enough to cater all the activities and smart home inhabitants may not be restricted to only those activities contained in AR model. So, AR models may not rightly recognise or infer new activities. Here, a framework has been proposed for dynamically capturing the new knowledge from activity patterns to evolve behavioural changes in AR model (i.e. ontology based model). This ontology-based framework adapts by learning the specialised and extended activities from existing user-performed activity patterns. Moreover, it can identify new activity patterns previously unknown in AR model, adapt the new properties in existing activity models and enrich ontology model by capturing change representation to enrich ontology model. The proposed framework has been evaluated comprehensively over the metrics of accuracy, statistical heuristics, and Kappa coefficient. A well-known dataset named DAMSH has been used for having an empirical insight into the effectiveness of proposed framework that shows a significant level of accuracy for AR models.;;;;Castro, Raul Garcia/AAU-4456-2020;Castro, Raul Garcia/0000-0002-0421-452X;;;;;;;;;;;;2043-6386;2043-6394;;;;AUG;2019;9;4;;;;;193;200;;10.1049/iet-wss.2018.5209;;;;;;;WOS:000476906000003;;;;;;
J;"Coyle, D; Nguyen, D";;;;"Coyle, Diane; Nguyen, David";;;Cloud Computing, Cross-Border Data Flows and New Challenges for Measurement in Economics;NATIONAL INSTITUTE ECONOMIC REVIEW;;;;;;;;;;;;When economists talk about 'measurement' they tend to refer to metrics that can capture changes in quantity, quality and distribution of goods and services. In this paper we argue that the digital transformation of the economy, particularly the rise of cloud computing as a general-purpose technology, can pose serious challenges to traditional concepts and practices of economic measurement. In the first part we show how quality-adjusted prices of cloud services have been falling rapidly over the past decade, which is currently not captured by the deflators used in official statistics. We then discuss how this enabled the spread of data-driven business models, while also lowering entry barriers to advanced production techniques such as artificial intelligence or robotic-process-automation. It is likely that these process innovations are not fully measured at present. A final challenge to measurement arises from the fragmentation of value chains across borders and increasing use of intangible intermediate inputs such as intellectual property and data. While digital technologies make it very easy for these types of inputs to be transferred within or between companies, existing economic statistics often fail to capture them at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0027-9501;1741-3036;;;;AUG;2019;249;1;;;;;R30;R38;;10.1177/002795011924900112;;;;;;;WOS:000476948500008;;;;;;

GP, M5P and ANN models were providing a good estimate of performance, whereas the RF model outperforms them. For this study, a dataset containing 52 observations obtained from the laboratory experiments. Total data set (52 observations) has been segregated in two different groups. The larger group (36) was used for model development and the smaller group (16) was used for testing the models. Input dataset consists of dispersive soil (%), cement clinker (%), fly ash (%) and curing time (days), whereas unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of soil (MPa) was taken as a target. Sensitivity testing results conclude that the curing time is the most essential factor in estimating the strength of dispersive soil with cement clinker and fly ash for RF-based modelling. The results of this study also suggest that the combined mix of cement clinker and fly ash are used to increase the UCS of dispersive soil than an alone mix.;;;;Singh, Suresh Prasad/M-9984-2018;SIHAG, PARVEEN/0000-0002-7761-0603;;;;;;;;;;;;0960-3182;1573-1529;;;;AUG;2019;37;4;;;;;2915;2926;;10.1007/s10706-019-00808-1;;;;;;;WOS:000474361400049;;;;;;

Thus, studies aiming to improve the performance of these vehicles are being proposed: from new sensing solutions to more robust control techniques. Additionally, the autonomous UAV has challenges in flight stages as the landing. This procedure needs to be performed safely with a reduced error margin in static and dynamic targets. To solve this imperative issue, many applications with computer vision and control theory have been developed. Therefore, this paper presents an alternative method to train a multilayer perceptron neural network based on fuzzy Mamdani logic to control the landing of a UAV on an artificial marker. The advantage of this method is the reduction in computational complexity while maintaining the characteristics and intelligence of the fuzzy logic controller. Results are presented with simulation and real tests for static and dynamic landing spots.

J;Khanapurkar, U;;;;Khanapurkar, Uday;;;India's Huawei Conundrum;INDIA QUARTERLY-A JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS;;;;;;;;;;;;Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, has emerged as a key player in the provision of infrastructure required to support 5G wireless networks, the adoption of which will be foundational to recipient countries' deployment of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of things. At the same time, however, security concerns with respect to Huawei's ties to the Chinese army and state abound, prompting a number of countries to ban the company from supplying them said telecom infrastructure. India, however, is on the fence in this regard. This article assesses India's Huawei conundrum through a conceptual framework of economic dependence wherein the costs of a ban and willingness to ban are examined in detail. It is argued that since the expected costs of banning Huawei equipment and the security risks of using them are both substantially high, India's course of action must be to defer a quick decision and bargain for benefits and assurances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0974-9284;0975-2684;;;;SEP;2019;75;3;;;;;380;394;9,74928E+14;10.1177/0974928419860924;;JUL 2019;;;;;WOS:000479429000001;;;;;;

Design/methodology/approach: In the study we conduct a software supported and iterative systematic literature review of the performance management field together with a keyword network analysis. The meta-analysis provided a quantitative method that identified gaps and directions. Findings: The findings suggest there is a link between performance measurement systems and dynamics, but the link is weak, and the main research does not incorporate dynamic elements. There is an observable research community interest in managing information for informed decisions through digitalization. However, two broad research perspectives on performance management systems in highly dynamic and competitive environments were identified, one group exploring dynamic conditions, and the other digital technologies and optimization. Researchers positioning themselves in the dynamic subgroup are likely take an organizational or human capital perspective when exploring applications of performance management systems, while the other group mainly pursues research within artificial intelligence, automatization, and optimization. There is limited research with coverage of both groups, highlighting a notable gap in the existing research.

The fast pace with which the multi-billion dollar AI industry advances toward the creation of human-level intelligence is accompanied by an increasingly exaggerated chorus of the 'incredible miracle', or the 'incredible horror', intelligent machines will constitute for humanity, as the human is gradually replaced by a technologically superior proxy, destined to be configured as a functional (data) component at best, a relic at worst. More than half a century ago, Gunther Anders sketched out this path toward technological obsolescence, and his work on 'Promethean shame' and 'Promethean discrepancy' provides an invaluable means with which to recognise and understand the relationship of the modern human to his/her technological products. In this article, I draw on Anders's writings to unpack and unsettle contemporary narratives of our relation to AI, with a view toward refocusing attention on the responsibilities we bear in producing such immersive technologies. With Anders, I suggest that we must exercise and develop moral imagination so that the human capacity for moral responsibility does not atrophy in our technologically mediated future.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0725-5136;1461-7455;;;;AUG;2019;153;1;;;SI;;94;112;7,25514E+14;10.1177/0725513619863854;;JUL 2019;;;;;WOS:000478363000001;;;;;;

This needs to be done while maintaining sustainable agricultural systems and simultaneously facing challenges such as a changing climate, depletion of water resources, and the potential for increased erosion and loss of productivity due to the occurrence of extreme weather events. Precision Agriculture emerged out of the advances in the 1980s because of the development of several key technologies like GPS and satellite imagery. This paper argues that with the increasing impact of climate change, the next revolution in precision agriculture and agriculture in general will be driven by Sustainable Precision Agriculture and Environment (SPAE, similar to the 7 Rs), which could leverage past technologies combined with Big Data analysis. This new, technology-focused SPAE transitions from a site-specific management focus to the notion of global sustainability. To accomplish this transition, we introduced the WebGIS framework as an organizing principle that connects local, site-specific data generators called smart farms to a regional and global view of agriculture that can support both the agricultural industry and policymakers in government. This will help integrate databases located in networks of networks into a system of systems to achieve the needed SPAE management and connect field, watershed, national, and worldwide sustainability. Automation and the use of artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), drones, robots, and Big Data serve as a basis for a global Digital Twin, which will contribute to the development of site-specific conservation and management practices that will increase incomes and global sustainability of agricultural systems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2571-581X;;;;JUL 16;2019;3;;;;;;;;54;10.3389/fsufs.2019.00054;;;;;;;WOS:000535744300001;;;;;;

It has revolutionized how physicians and patients view health and diseases. However, the dearth of radiologists to read these images has been an impending problem worldwide. Digitization of medical images in standard Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format and the seamless integration of imaging modalities through the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) has enabled easy acquisition and transfer of images across networks for viewing, enabling the teleradiology platform for reporting by radiologists from anywhere. CARE was one of the first to adopt this technology through a public private partnership model with district hospital, Mahabubnagar in 2001. Over the last 18 years, we are connected to district hospitals, private centres across India, small sized hospitals and also to some international diagnostic centres in Nigeria and Iraq. This paper highlights our experiences in Teleradiology across district hospitals, private centres and international centres and also showcases the turnaround time for reporting routine and emergency cases through this mode of technology. METHODS All imaging modalities namely computed radiography (CR), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that were used are DICOM compliant. These machines were seamlessly integrated and configured adhering to the DICOM protocol to push images through DICOM gateway service to receive images according to set predefined standards. The PACS server had MS SQL database to host all the patient demographics along with history for each case and all images were archived based on a file system architecture. Virtual assistants help radiologists by transcribing the report online, after which another team scrutinizes for quality assurance of the reports transcribed before finally signing off the report. RESULTS Teleradiology network was established with 3 district hospitals (Mahabubnagar, Tandur and Nalgonda), 9 private centres (Balaji Diagnostic Centre, Matrix Hospital, Holistic Hospital, Prime Hospital, KRSNA, KIMS, Archana, Sahasra, Kiran) and 2 international centres (Mecure Diagnostic Centre, Nigeria, Medya Diagnostic Centre-Iraq). More than 1,00,000 cases have been reported using this platform. The average turnaround time for routine cases was between 4-6 hours and for all emergency cases it was between 10-30 minutes. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, we found Teleradiology to be an effective methodology of reporting especially if virtual assistants are used in the reporting process, thereby optimizing the radiologist time. The turnaround time for cases significantly improved especially for emergency cases.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2278-4748;2278-4802;;;;JUL 8;2019;8;27;;;;;2144;2148;;10.14260/jemds/2019/470;;;;;;;WOS:000479117000002;;;;;;

Several industry buzzwords are addressed, such as IPR-linked open data (IPR LOD) databases, blockchain and IPR-related techniques, acknowledged for their contribution in moving towards artificial intelligence (AI) in IPRM. Design/methodology/approach The evaluation, following an original framework developed by the authors, is based on a literature review, web analysis and interviews carried out with some of the top experts from IPR-savvy multinational companies. Findings The paper presents the patent databases landscape, classifying patent offices according to the format of data provided and depicting the state-of-art in the IPR LOD. An examination of existing IPR tools shows that they are not yet fully developed, with limited usability for IPRM. After reviewing the techniques, it is clear that the current state-of-the-art is insufficient to fully address AI in IPR. Uses of blockchain in IPR show that they are yet to be fully exploited on a larger scale. Originality/value A critical analysis of IPR tools, techniques and blockchain allows for the state-of-art to be assessed, and for their current and potential value with regard to the development of the economy and wider society to be considered. The paper also provides a novel classification of patent offices and an original IPR-linked open data landscape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2444-8451;2444-8494;;;;JUL 8;2019;28;2;;;SI;;189;203;;10.1108/EJMBE-12-2018-0139;;;;;;;WOS:000477661600007;;;;;;

However, further innovation is still required to realize their full potential. Machine learning is an algorithm that learns from large datasets for pattern formation and classification. Deep learning, a form of machine learning, uses a multilayered neural network that mimics human neural circuit structure. Deep neural networks can automatically extract features from an image, although classical machine learning methods still require feature extraction by a human expert. Deep learning technology has developed recently; in particular, the accuracy of an image classification task by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) has exceeded that of humans since 2015. CNN is now used to address several tasks including medical issues. We believe that CNN would also have a great impact on the research of stem cell biology. iPSCs are utilized after their differentiation to specific cells, which are characterized by molecular techniques such as immunostaining or lineage tracing. Each cell shows a characteristic morphology; thus, a morphology-based identification system of cell type by CNN would be an alternative technique. The development of CNN enables the automation of identifying cell types from phase contrast microscope images without molecular labeling, which will be applied to several researches and medical science. Image classification is a strong field among deep learning tasks, and several medical tasks will be solved by deep learning-based programs in the future.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1880-8190;;;;JUL 5;2019;39;;;;;;;;14;10.1186/s41232-019-0103-3;;;;;;;WOS:000474384300001;31312276;;;;;

In the present research, first, an attempt was made to construct mechanical earth model based on well logging data, elastic moduli of rock, and appropriate failure criteria for the final purpose of calculating and determining safe mud weight window (SMWW). Finally, appropriate artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms were used to establish a relationship between well logging data and SMWW, which could be used to calculate and predict SMWW without using associated relationships with the mechanical earth model. This might end up with a decreased number of required parameters for calculating SMWW, including uniaxial compressive strength. In the present research, the learning process was conducted using datasets from three wells, two of which provided training data, with the other one used as testing data. The prepared model was finally used to predict corresponding pressures to SMWW and baseline pressures for hydraulic fracturing operation. The model gave a coefficient of determination of 0.93 when applied to the testing data using support vector regression algorithm with radial basis function kernel, indicating large capabilities of this algorithm in predicting non-foreseen data.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1226-9328;2166-3394;;;;JUL 4;2019;22;4;;;;;193;205;;10.1080/12269328.2018.1504697;;;;;;;WOS:000476917900002;;;;;;

The increasing demand for rail transport will lead to more pressure and stress on rail components and consequently higher rates of degradation. If degradation of railway components is not treated by means of effective maintenance strategies, catastrophic human casualties and massive financial losses are inevitable. Degradation prediction modelling is the key element in the establishment of cost-effective and efficient maintenance strategies in railway systems. This paper reviews different models proposed in the literature for rail track degradation prediction, including mechanistic models, statistical models and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of each model are explained, and factors influencing rail track degradation are investigated.;;;;"falamarzi, amir/I-1266-2013; Nazem, Majid/A-4267-2013";Nazem, Majid/0000-0002-6433-3416;;;;;;;;;;;;1448-8353;2204-2245;;;;JUL 3;2019;17;2;;;;;152;166;;10.1080/14488353.2019.1667710;;;;;;;WOS:000492779400008;;;;;;
J;Jones, A;;;;Jones, Adrian;;;New theories of mind and their implications for researching histories;RETHINKING HISTORY;;;;;;;;;;;;By considering new scholarship on the social distribution of cognition, artificial intelligence (AI) and philosophies of mind, this article suggests another epistemology for research in history. The contrast of new models of AI with old existentialist phenomenologies of being-in-time now suggests how meaningful action can operate without representations. These issues affect research in history. 'Picturing' theories of mind grounding Historicist and Poststructuralist academic historiographies are here re-appraised against these new trends. History research is found to be also now a quasi-ethnographic 'ontological' study of life-worlds in past being. The new epistemology I suggest here is a hermeneutic of inferences of descriptive disclosure of situated human predicaments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1364-2529;1470-1154;;;;JUL 3;2019;23;3;;;;;379;402;;10.1080/13642529.2019.1615701;;;;;;;WOS:000479085900007;;;;;;

However, AI has been creating much hype, too. In applying AI technology to patients, medical professionals should be able to resolve any anxiety, confusion, and questions that patients and the public may have. Also, they are responsible for ensuring that AI becomes a technology beneficial for patient care. These make the acquisition of sound knowledge and experience about AI a task of high importance for medical students. Preparing for AI does not merely mean learning information technology such as computer programming. One should acquire sufficient knowledge of basic and clinical medicines, data science, biostatistics, and evidence-based medicine. As a medical student, one should not passively accept stories related to AI in medicine in the media and on the Internet. Medical students should try to develop abilities to distinguish correct information from hype and spin and even capabilities to create thoroughly validated, trustworthy information for patients and the public.;;;;Park, Seong Ho/E-2271-2014;"Park, Seong Ho/0000-0002-1257-8315; Kim, Sungwon/0000-0001-5455-6926; Park, Joohyun/0000-0001-8029-0316; Lim, Young-Suk/0000-0002-1544-577X";;;;;;;;;;;;1975-5937;;;;;JUL 3;2019;16;;;;;;;;18;10.3352/jeehp.2019.16.18;;;;;;;WOS:000476586400001;31319450;;;;;

However, data subjects are perceived to be always unwilling to share their data on security and privacy reasons. They apprehend that those data will be misused at the cost of their privacy jeopardising their human rights. Thus, personal data sharing is closely associated with human right issues. This concern of data subjects has increased manifolds owing to the interference of Artificial Intelligence (AI) since AI can analyse data without human intervention. In this background, this article has taken an attempt to investigate how applications of AI and imposition of regulatory controls with appropriate governance can influence the impact of personal data sharing on the issues of human right abuses.;;;;Chatterjee, Sheshadri/AAN-9917-2020;Chatterjee, Sheshadri/0000-0003-1075-5549;;;;;;;;;;;;1548-3886;1548-3894;;;;JUL-SEP;2019;15;3;;;;;21;36;;10.4018/IJEGR.2019070102;;;;;;;WOS:000521648700002;;;;;;

The main issue with Deepfake videos is that anyone can produce explicit content without the consent of those involved. While some of these videos are humorous and benign, the majority of them are pornographic. The faces of celebrities and other well-known (and lesser-known) individuals have been superimposed on the bodies of porn stars. The existence of this technology erodes trust in video evidence and adversely affects its probative value in court. This article describes the current and future capabilities of this technology, stresses the need to plan for its treatment as evidence in court, and draws attention to its current and future impact on the authentication process of video evidence in courts. Ultimately, as the technology improves, parallel technologies will need to be developed and utilised to identify and expose fake videos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1365-7127;1740-5572;;;;JUL;2019;23;3;;;;;255;262;;10.1177/1365712718807226;;;;;;;WOS:000513135700002;;;;;;

We consider translation as a shared resource that is the result of producers and consumers who share the overall objective of providing sustainable access to reliable multilingual information. This view of translation as a shared knowledge resource is based on the reliance of machine learning-based translation techniques on the pooling and leverage of parallel text in the form of existing translations. These techniques build on the well-established practice of leveraging such resources as translation memories. We use the institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework to assist with analysis of the dynamic situations emerging through the use of MT, and consider why changes, such a shared ownership model, would ultimately benefit all stakeholders. We finally suggest some research questions that might help to assess sustainability for translation as a resource, an industry, and an occupation, such as 'what would happen if we left translation to machines?', 'why do translators not act collectively', and 'could principal and end customer buy-in be heightened by quantifying the threat to sustainability of access to translations?'.;;;;Moorkens, Joss/AAK-6278-2020;Moorkens, Joss/0000-0003-0766-0071;;;;;;;;;;;;1740-357X;;;;;JUL;2019;;32;;;;;2;25;;;;;;;;;WOS:000511182200002;;;;;;

The theoretical elaboration of the notion of spirit and the understanding that is reached of it, is produced at the same time as the theoretical understanding and elaboration of the notions of eternal death and sin, also in that period. The notion of eternal death makes it possible to differentiate between beings that succumb to time and are finite and bodily, and those that do not succumb to time and are eternal and spiritual. Sin is understood as the act of the spirit that produces that eternal death. Artificial organisms and artificial intelligence allow a new understanding of the way in which man is spiritual, and the way in which he is mortal, because they force us to differentiate between artificial spirits and natural spirits. Relations between the realm of the spiritual and that of the mortal are the subject of orthodox religions and of the heterodox occult sciences.

Social networks have created a competitive environment that, whether due to its dispersion or its capillarity, has relegated the mainstream media to a secondary role in the media ecosystem. Ironically, the technologies that threaten traditional journalism are also those that can save it; provided they are used correctly. Journalism, weakened by the economic crisis and with increasingly smaller newsrooms, has artificial intelligence as an opportunity to recover a certain centrality in the media ecosystem. This paper studies AIDA, a project from the Brazilian television network Globo. This project looked to automation as a way to avoid errors and ambiguities in the news.

Given the prevalence of technological neutrality and inevitabilism, most conceptualizations of the future tend to ignore moral problems. In this paper we argue that every choice about future technologies is a moral choice and even the most technology-dominated scenarios of the future are, in fact, moral provocations we have to imagine solutions to. We begin by explaining the intricate connection between morality and the future. After a short excursion into the history of Artificial Intelligence, we analyse two possible scenarios, which show that building the future with technology is, first and foremost, a moral endeavor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1220-5400;;;;;JUL-DEC;2019;63;2;;;;;223;234;;;;;;;;;WOS:000503010600001;;;;;;
J;Gouveia, SS;;;;Gouveia, Steven S.;;;A DEFENSE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF DISTRIBUTED RESPONSIBILITY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE;REVUE ROUMAINE DE PHILOSOPHIE;;;;;;;;;;;;One of the biggest challenges posed by Artificial Intelligence is the status of the normative concept of responsibility. With the emergence of increasingly developed technologies and artificial agents impacting the day by day, several problems arise but, at this stage, we don't seem to have the conceptual tools to engage with its solutions. The main caveat for that is the traditional or conventional thesis (CT) that it is held regarding Artificial Agents (AA). This view argues for the following negative thesis: no (AA) is responsible for its actions or motivations. On the basis of (CT) we can find a fundamental ontological assumption: the thesis that no (AA) posses, ontologically, the x property that is relevant to give moral status to an entity. In this paper we will argue that (CT) creates what it is known as the responsibility gap (RG). We will show that (CT) is implausible to deal with the rapid development of current technologies and, at the shoulders of Luciano Floridi (2013, 2016), we will propose the concept of Distributed Responsibility (DR) to close the current normative gap.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1220-5400;;;;;JUL-DEC;2019;63;2;;;;;235;248;;;;;;;;;WOS:000503010600002;;;;;;

This article focuses on applying these deep taxonomy techniques to network intrusion detection system (N-IDS) with the aim to enhance the performance in classifying the network connections as either good or bad. To substantiate this to NIDS, this article models network traffic as a time series data, specifically transmission control protocol / internet protocol (TCP/IP) packets in a predefined time-window with a supervised deep learning methods such as recurrent neural network (RNN), identity matrix of initialized values typically termed as identity recurrent neural network (IRNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), clock-work RNN (CWRNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), utilizing connection records of KDDCup-99 challenge data set. The main interest is given to evaluate the performance of RNN over newly introduced method such as LSTM and IRNN to alleviate the vanishing and exploding gradient problem in memorizing the long-term dependencies. The efficient network architecture for all deep models is chosen based on comparing the performance of various network topologies and network parameters. The experiments of such chosen efficient configurations of deep models were run up to 1,000 epochs by varying learning-rates between 0.01-05. The observed results of IRNN are relatively close to the performance of LSTM on KDDCup-99 NIDS data set. In addition to KDDCup-99, the effectiveness of deep model architectures are evaluated on refined version of KDDCup-99: NSL-KDD and most recent one, UNSW-NB15 NIDS datasets.;;;;;, Prabaharan/0000-0002-8812-0474;;;;;;;;;;;;1941-6210;1941-6229;;;;JUL-SEP;2019;11;3;;;SI;;65;89;;10.4018/IJDCF.2019070104;;;;;;;WOS:000500794900005;;;;;;

APM, also known as molecular manufacturing, is a token example of a converging technology, has great potential to impact and be affected by other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and ICT. The development of APM thus can have drastic global impacts depending on how it is designed and used. This article argues that the ethical issues that arise from APM - as both a standalone technology or as a converging one - affects the roles of stakeholders in such a way as to warrant an alternate means furthering responsible innovation in APM research. This article introduces a value-based design methodology called value sensitive design (VSD) that may serve as a suitable framework to adequately cater to the values of stakeholders. Ultimately, it is concluded that VSD is a strong candidate framework for addressing the moral concerns of stakeholders during the preliminary stages of technological development.;;;;Umbrello, Steven/N-7741-2017;Umbrello, Steven/0000-0003-2594-6313;;;;;;;;;;;;1947-3451;1947-346X;;;;JUL-DEC;2019;10;2;;;;;1;21;;10.4018/IJT.2019070101;;;;;;;WOS:000501179700001;;;;;;

A secondary source-destination pair experiencing deep fading on direct path is assisted by amplify-and-forward (AF) relays in an underlay mode. In this energy-constrained scenario, the aim is to maximize the secondary network's end-to-end SNR through an intelligent power-saving method incorporated with MRS. In contrast to the prior relay selection (RS) schemes, the relay-selection factor is the difference of SNR of the source-relay link and corresponding relay-destination link for each relay along with its corresponding interference channel coefficient. The difference factor aims to achieve the SNR upper bound while performing minimum power amplification, eventually resulting in interference mitigation as well. The proposed algorithm has been implemented using Fuzzy Rule Based System (FRBS), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and their performance has been compared through simulations.;;;;zafar, bassam/E-4405-2013;zafar, bassam/0000-0001-5083-1548;;;;;;;;;;;;1947-8283;1947-8291;;;;JUL-SEP;2019;10;3;;;;;1;18;;10.4018/IJAMC.2019070101;;;;;;;WOS:000500787700001;;;;;;

Aiming to investigate the potential of reducing anxiety through ad libitum interaction with Artificial Intelligence chatbots, a controlled pilot study was conducted on East Asian staff of a large financial institution over a 4-week period, the sample of 40 divided between a test group using AI and the non-exposed subjects. Variety of measures were employed to gain as comprehensive an insight as warranted given the study limitations of a small sample, brief study period and relatively unsophisticated but freely available AI chatbot. The measures ranged from surveys of anxiety, attitudes toward daily chatbot usage, oral interviews and IELTS testing of English speaking ability. The results were cautiously encouraging: nearly universal endorsement of AI as a non-threatening interlocutor positively impacting subjects' confidence and to the extent limited by time constraint, enhancing individual components of the IELTS paradigm. Moreover, significant linear relationship between individual anxiety survey items and overall IELTS scores at baseline was observed, lending a measure of validity to the construct developed for the occasion. In summary, it is felt that subject to further development and refinement, conversationally enhanced AI chatbots hold a significant promise toward reducing speech-related anxieties and learning inhibitions of English as a foreign language and thus merit further investigation toward this objective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2229-9327;;;;;JUL;2019;;;;;5;;28;40;;10.24093/awej/call5.3;;;;;;;WOS:000499957100003;;;;;;

J;Maas, MM;;;;Maas, Matthijs M.;;;INTERNATIONAL LAW DOES NOT COMPUTE: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE DEVELOPMENT, DISPLACEMENT OR DESTRUCTION OF THE GLOBAL LEGAL ORDER;MELBOURNE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW;;;;;;;;;;;;"Within the coming decade, the deployment of artificial intelligence ('AI') appears likely to have a disruptive impact on global affairs. What will such 'globally disruptive' AI imply for the form, function and viability of international law? I briefly sketch the long history of technological innovation driving, shaping and destroying international law. Drawing on scholarship on the relation between new technologies and international law, I argue that new technology changes legal situations both directly, by creating new entities or enabling new behaviour, and indirectly, by shifting incentives or values. I argue that development of increasingly more disruptive AI may produce three types of global legal impacts. The first is 'legal development' (patching); the second is 'legal displacement' (substitution); the third is 'legal destruction' (erosion). I discuss the potential impact of AI in all three modalities, and the implications for international relations. I argue that many of the challenges raised by AI could in principle be accommodated in the international law system through legal development, and that while AI may aid in compliance enforcement, the prospects for legal displacement a shift towards an 'automated international law' look slim. However, I also conclude that technical and political features of the technology will in practice render AI destructive to key areas of international law: the legal gaps it creates will be hard to patch, and the strategic capabilities it offers chip away at the rationales for powerful states to engage fully in, or comply with, international law regimes. This suggests some risk of obsolescence of distinct international law regimes.";;;;Maas, Matthijs/AAK-8705-2020;Maas, Matthijs/0000-0002-6170-9393;;;;;;;;;;;;1444-8602;1444-8610;;;;JUL;2019;20;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000498919300007;;;;;;

J;Gregory, S;;;;Gregory, Sam;;;Cameras Everywhere Revisited: How Digital Technologies and Social Media Aid and Inhibit Human Rights Documentation and Advocacy;JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE;;;;;;;;;;;;"Pessimism currently prevails around human rights globally, as well as about the impact of digital technology and social media in supporting rights. However, there have been key successes in the use of these tools for documentation and advocacy in the past decade, including greater participation, more documentation, and growth of new fields around citizen evidence and fact-finding. Governments and others antagonistic to human rights have caught up in terms of weaponizing the affordances of the internet and pushing back on rights actors. Key challenges to be grappled with are consistent with ones that have existed for a decade but are exacerbated now-how to protect and enhance safety of vulnerable people and provide agency over visibility and anonymity; how to ensure and improve trust and credibility of human rights documentation and advocacy campaigning; and how to identify and use new strategies that optimize for a climate of volume of media, declining trust in traditional sources, and active strategies of distraction and misinformation. All of these activities take place primarily within a set of platforms that are governed by commercial imperatives and attention-based algorithms, and that increasingly use unaccountable content moderation processes driven by artificial intelligence. The article argues for a pragmatic approach to harmreduction within the platforms and tools that are used by a diverse range of human rights defenders, and for a proactive engagement on ensuring that an inclusive human rights perspective is centred in responses to new challenges at a global level within a multipolar world as well as specific areas of challenge and opportunity such as fake news and authenticity, deepfakes, use of artificial intelligence to find and make sense of information, virtual reality, and how we ensure effective solidarity activism. Solutions and usages in these areas must avoid causing inadvertent as well as deliberate harms to already marginalized people.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1757-9619;1757-9627;;;;JUL;2019;11;2;;;;;373;392;;10.1093/jhuman/huz022;;;;;;;WOS:000492957700009;;;;;;

J;Tijus, C;;;;Tijus, Charles;;;Introduction : SMART connected objects for learning;ENFANCE;;;;;;;;;;;;"It is expected that the current revolution in the field of artificial intelligence is going to change our way of life but what's about learning? Will learning be facilitated for children? We first show that the core of artificial intelligence is the making of supervised learning through imitation, reasoning and knowledge, but also the making of unsupervised by discovery. By doing so, artificial intelligence allows the design of cognitive technologies that are technologies that incorporate knowledge about their users, for scientific research purposes but also for the design of SMART connected objects; with behavior, able to perform the cognitive functions that facilitate the achievement of the people objectives. This panorama is embedded in a reasoned presentation of cognitive technologies for learning that is used to introduce the content of the articles that are published in this issue of Enfance from the point of view of their contribution to the design of SMART objects dedicated for the learning of skills, knowledge and know how.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0013-7545;1969-6981;;;;JUL-SEP;2019;;3;;;;;299;307;;;;;;;;;WOS:000490019700002;;;;;;

To provide a clear insight to this problem and support researchers, we need a background understanding of various aspects related to ontology. Consequently, in this paper, a comprehensive review is conducted to map the literature studies to a coherent taxonomy. These include the benefits of ontology, types of ontology, application domains, development platforms, languages, tools, and methodologies. The paper also discusses the concept of ontology, semantic Web, and its contribution to several research fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Library Science and shared knowledge. The fundamentals of ontology presented in this paper can benefit readers who wish to embark in ontology-based research and applications development.;;;;Mahmoud, Moamin/W-1268-2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;2158-107X;2156-5570;;;;JUL;2019;10;7;;;;;290;298;;;;;;;;;WOS:000485682500041;;;;;;

Such a problem appears while solving some Artificial Intelligence problems, admitting formalization by means of predicate calculus language. The exact definition of the concept of isomorphism of such formulas is given in this paper. However, isomorphic elementary conjunctions of predicate formulas are formulas that, with some substitution of variables instead of their arguments, coincide with the accuracy of the order of writing literals. Problems are described that, when solved, mean the necessity of testing formulas for isomorphism arises.

The proposed method is based on an artificial neuronal network (ANN) which is trained with a data set filtered by the environmental variables that characterise the mentioned phenomena. A previously calculated ideal solar irradiation curve is modified from the forecasts generated by the ANN. The proposed methodology merges statistical learning methods and numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods, typically used to improve upon the raw forecast of a NWP model. A reduction of the uncertainty in the power production of photovoltaic plants in San Juan can be achieved with the results of the proposed forecasting method.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2051-3305;;;;JUL;2019;;18;;;;;4824;4829;;10.1049/joe.2018.9368;;;;;;;WOS:000482590000028;;;;;;

Thus, it becomes essential to perform technical risk assessment and CPS prognosis to envisage the integrity of the system's operational resilience. The communication network elements such as cyber signal transmission, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the internet of things (IoTs) converges as a superhighway hub. This seeks to improve on network operations for efficient power delivery of distributed energy resources (DERs) integration grid. It then demands system configuration to be firewalled to avoid operational intrusions and malfunctions. The paper examines the technical threats involved in the paradigm of schemes and mitigation strategies. The areas of study are the vulnerabilities of the DERs integration with CPS, WSNs and IoTs layers. The risk aversion strategies of DERs integration with CPS are also discussed. The study aims to ascertain the intrusion level and responses of the integrated DERs grid in terms of power management.

The microgrid EMS requires both generation forecast and load forecast to provide effective dispatch strategies. The efficiency of the EMS significantly relies on its forecasting accuracy. Firstly, this paper develops an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based forecasting model and then utilise it for the development of wind and PV generation forecasting agent for microgrid energy management. ANFIS adopt the self-learning capability from the neural network and linguistic expression function from fuzzy logic inference and stands at the top of both the technologies in performance. The proposed model has been tested using two data sets, i.e., PV historical data and historical wind data. The fuzzy c means clustering (FCM) with hybrid optimisation algorithm-based ANFIS model shows better forecasting accuracy with both PV and wind forecast, therefore, implemented as PV and wind forecasting agent for microgrid EMS.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2051-3305;;;;JUL;2019;;18;;;;;4852;4857;;10.1049/joe.2018.9323;;;;;;;WOS:000482590000033;;;;;;

This study uses multiple examples of the same generator bearing failure to provide insight into how condition monitoring systems can be used in to train machine learning algorithms with the ultimate goal of predicting failure and remaining useful life. Results show that by analysing high-frequency vibration data and extracting key features to train support vector machine algorithms, an accuracy of 67% can be achieved in successfully predicting failure 1-2 months before occurrence. This study reflects on the limitations surrounding a generalised training approach, taking advantage of all available data, showing that if too many different examples are considered of different wind turbines and operating conditions, the overall accuracy can be diminished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2051-3305;;;;JUL;2019;;18;;;;;4965;4969;;10.1049/joe.2018.9281;;;;;;;WOS:000482590000055;;;;;;

In order to maintain the system stability, the system operator is required to initiate appropriate preventive control action under severe contingencies while satisfying the system operating constraints. Real time transient stability assessment (TSA) of power system is proposed in this paper by using wide area measurement system (WAMS) and phasor measurement units (PMUs). An architecture based on least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) has been developed to identify the system stability state in real time. Also, this paper proposes a coherency based selection method to identify the appropriate members for generation rescheduling as preventive operation in insecure operating contingency. Rotor angle trajectories based transient stability index (TSI) is employed to classify the generators as either critical or non-critical generators in a power network. Accordingly preventive control action in the form of generation rescheduling can be initiated to achieve stability. The method has been demonstrated on the IEEE 10-machines, 39-bus system. The proposed methodology is effective and capable of handling complex power system models with multiple contingencies.;;;;"SONI, BHANU PRATAP/N-1356-2017; Saxena, Akash/J-2683-2019";"SONI, BHANU PRATAP/0000-0001-8138-5392; Saxena, Akash/0000-0002-1820-8024; Surana, S L/0000-0003-0389-5033";;;;;;;;;;;;;2051-3305;;;;JUL;2019;;18;;;;;5345;5350;;10.1049/joe.2018.9353;;;;;;;WOS:000482590000130;;;;;;

There exists extensive literature on GT gas-path diagnostics and a variety of methods have been introduced. The fundamental limitations of the conventional methods such as the inability to deal with the nonlinear engine behavior, measurement uncertainty, simultaneous faults, and the limited number of sensors available remain the driving force for exploring more advanced techniques. This review aims to provide a critical survey of the existing literature produced in the area over the past few decades. In the first section, the issue of GT degradation is addressed, aiming to identify the type of physical faults that degrade a gas turbine performance, which gas-path faults contribute more significantly to the overall performance loss, and which specific components often encounter these faults. A brief overview is then given about the inconsistencies in the literature on gas-path diagnostics followed by a discussion of the various challenges against successful gas-path diagnostics and the major desirable characteristics that an advanced fault diagnostic technique should ideally possess. At this point, the available fault diagnostic methods are thoroughly reviewed, and their strengths and weaknesses summarized. Artificial intelligence (AI) based and hybrid diagnostic methods have received a great deal of attention due to their promising potentials to address the above-mentioned limitations along with providing accurate diagnostic results. Moreover, the available validation techniques that system developers used in the past to evaluate the performance of their proposed diagnostic algorithms are discussed. Finally, concluding remarks and recommendations for further investigations are provided.;;;;Fentaye, Amare/ABA-6189-2020;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2226-4310;;;;JUL;2019;6;7;;;;;;;83;10.3390/aerospace6070083;;;;;;;WOS:000479006500001;;;;;;

The actual use of artificial intelligence methods to create an intellectual environment to improve the competence of the student. Recently, research into the most popular use of artificial intelligence has been the use of Bayesian network apparatus. When creating an intellectual environment for improving the competence of a student, the Bayesian approach is promising. At present, the theory of Bayesian networks is used in various fields of science and production in solving various applied problems. There is a fairly large number of software products for working with Bayesian networks. These products are divided into commercial and free. To implement the mathematical ideas of the Bayesian network, the BayesiaLab application software package is well applied and is one of the high-quality software products that specializes in artificial intelligence technologies. With the help of the package BayesiaLab, you can explore, edit, analyze and determine the model of the Bayesian network. This article provides definitions of various scientists to the term competence and explores the possibilities of using Bayesian networks in the formation of students' competence in the direction of information technology. For the formation of students' competencies in the field of information technology, a generalized algorithm and a general architecture of the intellectual environment have been developed. In order to improve professional competence in education, it leads to an increase in the competitiveness of specialists, an improvement in the content, methodology, and updating of the corresponding educational environment. In the formation of competence, a number of technologies are applied: cognitive-oriented, activity-oriented, personality-oriented. The approach used in the formation of competencies is used to simulate the quality of student knowledge. The level of competence depends on the method chosen.;;;;"Mamyrbayev, Orken Zh/O-1265-2017; Shayakhmetova, Assem/ABA-1440-2020";"Mamyrbayev, Orken Zh/0000-0001-8318-3794; Shayakhmetova, Assem/0000-0002-4072-3671";;;;;;;;;;;;1991-346X;2518-1726;;;;JUL-AUG;2019;4;326;;;;;50;58;;10.32014/2019.2518-1726.43;;;;;;;WOS:000478014400006;;;;;;

Research has shown that those working on such cases can experience psychological distress. As a result, there has been a greater effort to create and implement technologies that reduce exposure to CSAM. However, not much work has explored gathering insight regarding the functionality, effectiveness, accuracy, and importance of digital forensic tools and data science technologies from practitioners who use them. This study focused specifically on examining the value practitioners give to the tools and technologies they utilize to investigate CSAM cases. General findings indicated that implementing filtering technologies is more important than safe-viewing technologies; false positives are a greater concern than false negatives; resources such as time, personnel, and money continue to be a concern; and an improved workflow is highly desirable. Results also showed that practitioners are not well-versed in data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is alarming given that tools already implement these techniques and that practitioners face large amounts of data during investigations. Finally, the data exemplified that practitioners are generally not taking advantage of tools that implement data science techniques, and that the biggest need for them is in automated child nudity detection, age estimation and skin tone detection.

Future challenges call for multiple and multidimensional responses, some of which were addressed at EFSA's Third Scientific Conference. The participants indicated that risk assessment bodies involved in food safety such as EFSA must recognise that data, methods and expertise (i.e. people) are the three basic elements underlying risk assessments. These elements need constant consideration and adaptation to ensure preparedness for the future. Moreover, it should be recognised that knowledge and expertise are distributed throughout society and are thus not limited to scientists. Aspects considered during the breakout session included: (1) increased complexity, (2) the crowd workforce, (3) citizen science, (4) stakeholder engagement, (5) talent pools and (7) entrepreneurship. To account for future challenges, behavioural, attitudinal and cultural changes must be implemented successfully. At a societal level, people are increasingly going hand in hand with robotics and artificial intelligence in sharing expertise and producing outcome. This needs consideration on ethics and values, both for organisations and individuals. At an organisational level, risk assessment bodies will have to tap into new talent pools and new solutions for a more fluid and ad hoc-based workforce. Future risk assessment bodies will have to actively engage with stakeholders when performing their assessments. It is expected that the impacts of citizen science and involvement of the crowd will become part of risk assessment practices. Consequently, EFSA will have to continue to invest in massive, ongoing skills development programmes. At an individual level, potential recruits will need to be assessed against a whole new set of competencies and capabilities: technical competencies in data science, computational science and artificial intelligence, alongside a large set of soft skills.

According to journalists, a revolution is upon us: One day the first artificial intelligence robot receives its medical degree, the next, new algorithms have surpassed the skill of medical experts. It seems that any day now, medical doctors will be unemployed, superseded by the younger siblings of Siri. But having worked on both medical imaging and machine learning, I think the reality is different, and, at the risk of disappointing some physicians' colleagues who thought the holidays were close, there is still work for us doctors for many decades. The new technology, in fact, offers a great opportunity to enhance health services worldwide, if doctors and engineers collaborate better together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0926-4981;1564-0094;;;;JUL;2019;;118;;;;;6;7;;;;;;;;;WOS:000475877300002;;;;;;

Of the information contained in a digital medical image, visual analysis can only extract about 10%. Radiomics aims to extract an enormous wealth of quantitative data from biomedical images, which could not be processed through simple visual analysis, but is capable of providing more information on the underlying pathophysiological phenomena and biological processes within human body. The subsequent mining of these quantitative data can offer very useful information on the aggressiveness of the disease under investigation, opening at the tailoring of the therapies based on a patient's needs and at the monitoring of the response to care. Therefore, by using specific mathematical algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques, radiomics provides very powerful support for precision medicine, especially in oncology.;;;;"Barucci, Andrea/AAX-1872-2020; Barucci, Andrea/D-5085-2016";Barucci, Andrea/0000-0002-3759-7512;;;;;;;;;;;;0926-4981;1564-0094;;;;JUL;2019;;118;;;;;15;16;;;;;;;;;WOS:000475877300008;;;;;;

The use of intellectual property rights and contracts, combined with technological protection measures, can hinder TDM and the deployment of SDSs. Further, those legal constraints can negatively impact on artificial intelligence innovation, because that requires improved access to data. There are thus various arguments for enhanced machine legibility. However, the TDM exceptions included in the recently approved Directive onCopyright in the DigitalSingleMarket do not appear to clear the way for enhanced machine legibility. In relation to SDSs, we also argue that the principle of transparency, which is embedded in consumer and data protection laws, can serve as a last line of defence against prohibition of TDM.;;;;;Ducato, Rossana/0000-0002-4912-0033;;;;;;;;;;;;0018-9855;2195-0237;;;;JUL;2019;50;6;;;;;649;684;;10.1007/s40319-019-00833-w;;;;;;;WOS:000475814200002;;;;;;

Artificial neural networks (ANN) have recently shown the ability to predict admission volume, acuity, and operative needs at a single trauma center with very high reliability. This model has not been tested in a multicenter model with differing climate and geography. We hypothesize that an ANN can accurately predict trauma admission volume, penetrating trauma admissions, and mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) with a high degree of reliability across multiple trauma centers. METHODS Three years of admission data were collected from five geographically distinct US Level I trauma centers. Patients with incomplete data, pediatric patients, and primary thermal injuries were excluded. Daily number of traumas, number of penetrating cases, and mean ISS were tabulated from each center along with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data from local airports. We trained a single two-layer feed-forward ANN on a random majority (70%) partitioning of data from all centers using Bayesian Regularization and minimizing mean squared error. Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient was calculated for each partition, each trauma center, and for high- and low-volume days (>1 standard deviation above or below mean total number of traumas). RESULTS There were 5,410 days included. There were 43,380 traumas, including 4,982 penetrating traumas. The mean ISS was 11.78 (SD = 6.12). On the training partition, we achieved R = 0.8733. On the testing partition (new data to the model), we achieved R = 0.8732, with a combined R = 0.8732. For high- and low-volume days, we achieved R = 0.8934 and R = 0.7963, respectively. CONCLUSION An ANN successfully predicted trauma volumes and acuity across multiple trauma centers with very high levels of reliability. The correlation was highest during periods of peak volume. This can potentially provide a framework for determining resource allocation at both the trauma system level and the individual hospital level. Copyright (c) 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Feature selection was done using LASSO in R to determine the best regression model. Prediction models were developed using several supervised machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and classification and regression tree. Feature selection by LASSO along with the inclusion of additional clinically relevant variables identified 8 top features associated with recommendation for dental care. The top 3 features include gum health, number of prescription medications taken, and race. Gum health shows a significantly higher relative importance compared to other features. Demographics, healthcare access, and general health variables were identified as top features related to receiving additional dental care, consistent with prior research.

In the process of their protection and maintenance, it is crucial to conduct regular routine inspections on them. During the regular routine inspections, the identification and statistics for components on historic buildings are of great significance to conservators, managers and visitors. However, the current identification and statistics work is almost carried out by human eyes, which is time consuming and labor intensive. Actually, this work can be done by artificial intelligence. In order to promote the intelligent development of routine inspections of historic buildings, this paper proposes a methodology in the case of the Forbidden City to identify and count the numbers of intact and impaired components based on Convolutional Neural Network. The applied algorithm is Faster R-CNN, which is an effective object detection algorithm for 2D images. In addition, the positions of the missing components can be inferred and marked in the images as their regularity of the positional arrangement. This methodology can lay the foundation for the subsequent intelligent inspection system of the historic buildings. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Science is pacing toward an Autonomy of Things at a rate faster than society's understanding of autonomous systems. This is causing a backlash against autonomous systems in general. For example, many well-known people have called the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) an existential threat to the human race, while the wave of self-driving cars is facing huge regulatory and ethical obstacles. Industrial robotics had posed a similar kind of threat to job security and human safety in the past. However, benefits from industrial robotics outweighed the problems they imposed, and society has been able to see that. This visibility was made possible by the contributions of many scientists, engineers, and policy makers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2380-1298;2333-942X;;;;JUL;2019;5;3;;;;;52;59;;10.1109/MSMC.2019.2916239;;;;;;;WOS:000561984800011;;;;;;

It accounts for the various aspects of data being a crucial raw material and most relevant to accelerate materials research and engineering. NOMAD, with the NOMAD Repository, and its code-independent and normalized form, the NOMAD Archive, comprises the worldwide largest data collection of this field. Based on its findable accessible, interoperable, reusable data infrastructure, various services are offered, comprising advanced visualization, the NOMAD Encyclopedia, and artificial-intelligence tools. The latter are realized in the NOMAD Analytics Toolkit. Prerequisite for all this is the NOMAD metadata, a unique and thorough description of the data, that are produced by all important computer codes of the community. Uploaded data are tagged by a persistent identifier, and users can also request a digital object identifier to make data citable. Developments and advancements of parsers and metadata are organized jointly with users and code developers. In this work, we review the NOMAD concept and implementation, highlight its orthogonality to and synergistic interplay with other data collections, and provide an outlook regarding ongoing and future developments.;;;;Draxl, Claudia/O-6189-2016;Draxl, Claudia/0000-0003-3523-6657;;;;;;;;;;;;;2515-7639;;;;JUL 1;2019;2;3;;;;;;;36001;10.1088/2515-7639/ab13bb;;;;;;;WOS:000560036600001;;;;;;

This massive amount of raw data needs to be stored and interpreted in order to advance the materials science field. Identifying correlations and patterns from large amounts of complex data is being performed by machine learning algorithms for decades. Recently, the materials science community started to invest in these methodologies to extract knowledge and insights from the accumulated data. This review follows a logical sequence starting from density functional theory as the representative instance of electronic structure methods, to the subsequent high-throughput approach, used to generate large amounts of data. Ultimately, data-driven strategies which include data mining, screening, and machine learning techniques, employ the data generated. We show how these approaches to modern computational materials science are being used to uncover complexities and design novel materials with enhanced properties. Finally, we point to the present research problems, challenges, and potential future perspectives of this new exciting field.;;;;Schleder, Gabriel R/C-7986-2016;"Schleder, Gabriel R/0000-0003-3129-8682; Fazzio, Adalberto/0000-0001-5384-7676; Michejevs Padilha, Antonio Claudio/0000-0003-1697-2800; Mera Acosta, Carlos Augusto/0000-0002-9148-2142";;;;;;;;;;;;;2515-7639;;;;JUL 1;2019;2;3;;;;;;;32001;10.1088/2515-7639/ab084b;;;;;;;WOS:000560033900003;;;;;;

Here, we explore the capability of a chemistry-savvy machine intelligence to generate synthetically accessible molecules. DINGOS (design of innovative NCEs generated by optimization strategies) is a virtual assembly method that combines a rule-based approach with a machine learning model trained on successful synthetic routes described in chemical patent literature. This unique combination enables a balance between ligand-similarity-based generation of innovative compounds by scaffold hopping and the forward-synthetic feasibility of the designs. In a prospective proof-of-concept application, DINGOS successfully produced sets of de novo designs for four approved drugs that were in agreement with the desired structural and physicochemical properties. Target prediction indicated more than 50% of the designs to be biologically active. Four selected computer-generated compounds were successfully synthesized in accordance with the synthetic route proposed by DINGOS. The results of this study demonstrate the capability of machine learning models to capture implicit chemical knowledge from chemical reaction data and suggest feasible syntheses of new chemical matter. Artificial intelligence approaches can aid medicinal chemists to creatively look for new chemical entities with drug-like properties. A rule-based approach combined with a machine learning model was trained on successful synthetic routes described in chemical patent literature. This process produced computer-generated compounds that mimic known medicines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2522-5839;;;;JUL;2019;1;7;;;;;307;315;;10.1038/s42256-019-0067-7;;;;;;;WOS:000566945700005;;;;;;

Deep learning is an emerging transformative tool in diagnostic medicine, yet limited access and the interpretability of learned parameters hinders widespread adoption. Here we have generated a diverse repository of 838,644 histopathologic images and used them to optimize and discretize learned representations into 512-dimensional feature vectors. Importantly, we show that individual machine-engineered features correlate with salient human-derived morphologic constructs and ontological relationships.

The measurement of naturalistic in-car driving behavior can be used to evaluate trip complexity, including diversity, length, and frequency of trips and associated destinations. This paper examined measurement methods for trip complexity and driving destinations using GPS data for older adult drivers with differing health statuses, focusing primarily on cognitive health status. Older driver subgroups included four groups with relatively stable health: better overall health, better cognitive health, worse cognitive health, and worse overall health and one group with declining cognitive health. Older drivers with better health status (overall and cognitive) had higher measured trip complexity compared to those with worse health status. Two variables, mean trip distance and percent of trips driven during the workweek evening rush-hour, declined significantly (p <= 0.049) in-line with cognitive declines but did not meaningfully discriminate cognitively declining older drivers from cognitively stable drivers (sensitivity: 18.8%-43.8%; specificity: 58.0%-93.3%). This contrast between significant group differences and nonpredictive declining group changes may suggest that self-referential naturalistic driving measures are needed to identify meaningful changes in driving behavior. In addition to the development of self-referential driving measurement systems, careful consideration of big data analysis as they apply to naturalistic driving is warranted. These include but are not limited to issues of validation, anonymity, measure-based definitions, and occurrence of outlier-type driving events like city-to-city travel.";;;;Knoefel, Frank/AAY-7539-2020;"Knoefel, Frank/0000-0002-5760-4484; Marshall, Shawn/0000-0002-0893-6159";;;;;;;;;;;;0018-9456;1557-9662;;;;JUL;2019;68;7;;;;;2451;2459;;10.1109/TIM.2019.2913055;;;;;;;WOS:000471078900016;;;;;;

For the most part, this research effort has limited its attention to the study of Web-based systems. It has also, perhaps unsurprisingly, tended to highlight the social scientific relevance of such systems. The present paper seeks to expand the scope of the social machine research effort to encompass the Internet of Things. One advantage of this expansion is that it helps to reveal some of the links between the science of social machines and the sciences of the mind. A second advantage is that it furthers our conceptual understanding of social machines and supports the quest to derive a philosophically-robust definition of the term social machine. The results of the present analysis suggest that social machines are best conceived as systems in which a combination of social and technological elements play a role in the mechanistic realization of system-level phenomena. The analysis also highlights the relevance of cognitive science and the philosophy of mind to our general understanding of systems that transcend the cyber, physical, and social domains.;;;;;Smart, Paul/0000-0001-9989-5307;;;;;;;;;;;;1568-7759;1572-8676;;;;JUL;2019;18;3;;;;;551;575;;10.1007/s11097-018-9583-x;;;;;;;WOS:000471310700005;;;;;;

Methods and materials: Twitter was searched for all tweets containing the terms artificial intelligence and radiology from November 2016 to October 2017. Users posting the tweets, tweet content, and linked websites were categorized. Results: Six hundred and five tweets were identified. These were from 407 unique users (most commonly industry-related individuals [22.6%]; radiologists only 9.3%) and linked to 216 unique websites. 42.5% of users were from the United States. The tweets mentioned machine/deep learning in 17.2%, industry in 14.0%, a medical society/conference in 13.4%, and a university in 9.8%. 6.3% mentioned a specific clinical application, most commonly oncology and lung/tuberculosis. 24.6% of tweets had a favorable stance regarding the impact of AI on radiology, 75.4% neutral, and none were unfavorable. 88.0% of linked websites leaned toward AI being positive for the field of radiology; none leaned toward AI being negative for the field. 51.9% of linked websites specifically mentioned improved efficiency for radiology with AI. 35.2% of websites described challenges for implementing AI in radiology. Of the 47.2% of websites that mentioned the issue of AI replacing radiologists, 77.5% leaned against AI replacing radiologists, 13.7% had a neutral view, and 8.8% leaned toward AI replacing radiologists. Conclusion: These observations provide an overview of the social media discussions regarding AI in radiology. While noting challenges, the discussions were overwhelmingly positive toward the transformative impact of AI on radiology and leaned against AI replacing radiologists. Greater radiologist engagement in this online social media dialog is encouraged. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

It also has a significant impact on many aspects of society and industry, ranging from scientific discovery, healthcare and medical diagnostics to smart cities, transport and sustainability. Within this 21st century 'man meets machine' reality unfolding, several social and juristic challenges emerge for which we are poorly prepared. We here review social dilemmas where individual interests are at odds with the interests of others, and where artificial intelligence might have a particularly hard time making the right decision. An example thereof is the well-known social dilemma of autonomous vehicles. We also review juristic challenges, with a focus on torts that are at least partly or seemingly due to artificial intelligence, resulting in the claimant suffering a loss or harm. Here the challenge is to determine who is legally liable, and to what extent.

The role of the dysregulated immune response in the pathophysiology of sepsis, coupled with the diversity of phenotypes it encompasses, highlights the need for a precision medicine approach. Areas covered: This paper is a narrative review of the current evidence on precision medicine in sepsis. The main recent advances are in the field of Omics-based technologies and big data analytics. Expert opinion: Different clusters of patients based on gene-expression profiles have been identified and showed potential diagnostic and prognostic utility. Prediction models based on electronic medical records (EMR) and developed with artificial intelligence algorithms are being applied in clinical practice.

Moreover, VR is also an effective assessment tool with practical applications that range from social and cognitive deficits to addiction. Nevertheless, despite progress, evidence-based psychological treatments still need improvement. In this paper we suggest that the integration of VR with another emerging technology - Artificial Intelligence (AI) - will provide clinicians with two new powerful tools for improving evidence-based psychological treatments: advanced digital therapeutics and digital biomarkers. The term Digital Therapeutics indicates the use of digital/online health technologies to treat a medical or psychological condition. Following this definition, any VR clinical application can be defined as a form of digital therapeutics. However, the integration between VR al Al allows a critical feature for any digital therapeutic: personalization. On one side, VR allows the collection of Digital Biomarkers - physiological, and behavioral data that are collected by means of digital technologies and used as an indicator of biologic processes or biological responses to therapeutic interventions - that are directly connected to the brain functioning and can be altered to correct the specific dysfunctions of the predictive coding mechanisms in the individual's brain.

Although this image-based communication has become a wide form of online self-presentation, it is still less investigated if compared to social media text content analysis of written posts. Crucially, most Instagram images that circulate on a daily base show thin, muscular, and unrealistic body ideal, creating a breeding ground for disordered eating. Far less investigated is the emotional profile of pictures with hashtags related to eating disorders. The aim of the study was to examine the emotional expression ofhashtags related to eating disorders of images posted by users on Instagram. Two hundred and fifty Instagram photos of females were considered. The hashtags were selected accordingly to a web-ranking on the most popular hashtags for eating disorders on Instagram: #anorexia, #thinispiration, #eatingdisorder, #fitinspiration and #body. The emotions expressed in each photo were measured using the Emotion API from Microsoft Azure Cognitive Service. The results showed that happiness intensity was significantly higher in images with #eatingdisorder and #fitispiration compared to #body, and higher levels of neutral emotion were found in images tagged with #body and #thinispiration.

However, concerns about interpretability and accountability of AI have been raised by influential thinkers. In spite of the recent impact of AI, several works have identified the need for principled knowledge representation and reasoning mechanisms integrated with deep learning-based systems to provide sound and explainable models for such systems. Neural-symbolic computing aims at integrating, as foreseen by Valiant, two most fundamental cognitive abilities: the ability to learn from the environment, and the ability to reason from what has been learned. Neural-symbolic computing has been an active topic of research for many years, reconciling the advantages of robust learning in neural networks and reasoning and interpretability of symbolic representation. In this paper, we survey recent accomplishments of neural-symbolic computing as a principled methodology for integrated machine learning and reasoning. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach by outlining the main characteristics of the methodology: principled integration of neural learning with symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning allowing for the construction of explainable AI systems. The insights provided by neural-symbolic computing shed new light on the increasingly prominent need for interpretable and accountable AI systems.;;;;;"Garcez, Artur/0000-0001-7375-9518; Lamb, Luis/0000-0003-1571-165X; Tran, Son/0000-0002-5912-293X";;;;;;;;;;;;2055-3706;2055-3714;;;;JUN;2019;6;4;;;SI;;611;631;;;;;;;;;WOS:000519571400002;;;;;;

The working and technology of different devices used in these domains have exceptionally changed due to communication speed, data generation, selection, storage and processing. Utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data has further enhanced the potential, efficiency and accuracy of such devices. Role of Cloud Computing as storage, networking, processing and security application in the overall working of IoT devices cannot be ignored as these devices are generally too small to do all these operations on its own.

J;"Frith, J; Wilken, R";;;;"Frith, Jordan; Wilken, Rowan";;;Social shaping of mobile geomedia services: An analysis of Yelp and Foursquare;COMMUNICATION AND THE PUBLIC;;;;;;;;;;;;In their book, Location-Based Social Media: Space, Time and Identity, Leighton Evans and Michael Saker remark on the apparent 'death' of location-based social networks, suggesting that location-based social networks can now be understood as 'a form of zombie-media that animates and haunts other media platforms'. In this article, we use this perspective as a point of departure for a social shaping of technology-informed analysis of two key geomedia platforms: Yelp and Foursquare. With Yelp approaching its 15th year of service and Foursquare approaching its 10th anniversary, this article provides a timely opportunity to (re-)examine the significance of Yelp and Foursquare and the many reconfigurations both firms have made to their services since their launch. These include, most recently, Yelp's integration of artificial intelligence/machine learning techniques to parse, sift and order users' posts and Foursquare's development of its Pilgrim SDK (software design kit) to power the location services of other platforms, like Tinder and Snap. A social shaping-inflected approach is productive in this context in that it stresses how many of these developments and strategic reorientations are not just in response to shareholder and investor pressures, they are also fundamentally shaped by and made in response to the fluctuating demands of end-users within a complicated, competitive and continuously evolving geomedia ecosystem. Consequently, we draw from the work of Leah A Lievrouw to examine how dual tensions of contingency/determination shape how these applications are designed and used, and how both design and use continue to evolve in response to various external pressures.;;;;;Wilken, Rowan/0000-0002-3022-0675;;;;;;;;;;;;2057-0473;2057-0481;;;;JUN;2019;4;2;;;;;133;149;;10.1177/2057047319850200;;;;;;;WOS:000509374500004;;;;;;

AI applications will further tilt the global balance of power in favor of actors who can make the best use of the emerging technology. AI-assisted automation is also changing prevailing socioeconomic production models on the global scale; and in the not too distant future, it is expected to exert systemic impacts on the current global order. Having recognized the full potential of AI technology in propelling the next industrial revolution, China has adopted an AI development strategy for guiding a nation-wide campaign to harness AI power at an early stage, so as to seize the strategic initiative in an emerging global AI competition.

Although, remaining time prediction of ongoing business instances has been always a research question in this area, most of the existing literature does not take into account dynamicity of environment and the underlying process commonly known as concept drift. In this paper, a two-phase approach is presented to predict the remaining time of ongoing process instances; in the first phase, future path of process instances is predicted using an annotated transition system with Fuzzy Support Vector Machine probabilities based on case data and in the second phase, the remaining time is predicted by summing up the duration of future activities each estimated by Support Vector Regressor. Finally, a concept drift adaptation method is proposed. To benchmark the proposed prediction method along with the proposed concept drift adaptation method, experiments are conducted using a real-world event log and a simulation event log. The results show that the proposed approach gained 13% improvement on remaining time prediction in case of concept drift.";;;;Hassanpour, Hamid/AAL-7271-2020;Hassanpour, Hamid/0000-0002-5513-9822;;;;;;;;;;;;2008-6822;;;;;SUM-FAL;2019;10;2;;;;;153;166;;10.22075/IJNAA.2019.4182;;;;;;;WOS:000506403500012;;;;;;

It draws on a previous study on the relationship between gender and AI, complemented by an analysis of digital assistants such as Alexa, Cortana, Google Assistant and Siri that reveals how these entities tend to be feminized through their anthropomorphization, the tasks that they perform and their behavioural traits. Furthering this discussion, this article addresses current trends of development of digital assistants and their stance towards gender, considering the fiinctions or features that are being prioritized in AI evolution. It then focuses on the main questions raised by researchers and academics when examining the phenomenon and confronts these views with discussions around the feminization of AI in the context of online media coverage. This debate also highlights how common conceptions of AI and its portrayals of gender are influenced by bodies of fiction. Finally, the project Conversations with ELIZA seeks to comment on this phenomenon by ironically exposing and reinforcing common stereotypes and gender assumptions. In this manner, this study seeks to incite reflection on how artificial intelligence is reflecting our social and cultural views back to us.;;;;;"Ribas, Luisa/0000-0002-5492-807X; Costa, Pedro/0000-0002-8382-2370";;;;;;;;;;;;1477-965X;1758-9533;;;;JUN;2019;17;1-2;;;;;171;193;;10.1386/tear_00014_1;;;;;;;WOS:000502110500014;;;;;;

The introductory section provides a general description of the approach. In so doing, the authors briefly consider different theories of concepts and Fregean ideas among them. Next, the authors introduce their conception of neurophenomenology as far as the cognitive procedure of categorization is concerned. They also describe their previous results in the formal (logical) representation of concepts as functions. The second section introduces the calculus of concrete concepts (concepts whose extensions consist of substances) as a natural deduction system. The authors consider concepts as object-to-object functions expressing the result of the cognitive processing of perceptive stimuli. The current version of this calculus is designed to establish standard relations between concepts and, first of all, the inclusion relation, which allows specifying the remaining fundamental and secondary relations. The consequence relation between two concepts means that the extension of the first is included into the extension of the second. The authors formalize both simple and complex types of objects constructed with the help of operations that are analogs of conjunction, disjunction and negation. The section ends with the discussion of the meaning of some rules of inference. In the final part of the article, the authors sum up the findings and outline the prospect of further research in this area. The prospect is, first of all, the construction of adequate semantics for the proposed calculus and extension of the calculus to the case of quantified attributes. This calculus could be further modified in an obvious way to provide a formal representation of abstract concepts. All this allows considering the prospects of this formalism for computer science and the project of artificial intelligence in the field of knowledge representation and processing, as well as for modeling the machine learning process (in particular, instance-based learning).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1998-863X;2311-2395;;;;JUN;2019;49;;;;;;26;33;;10.17223/1998863X/49/3;;;;;;;WOS:000500731200003;;;;;;

Methods A systematic literature review was performed in PubMed MEDLINE in November 2018, with key words referring to big data, AI and RMDs. All original reports published in English were analysed. A mirror literature review was also performed outside of RMDs on the same number of articles. The number of data analysed, data sources and statistical methods used (traditional statistics, AI or both) were collected. The analysis compared findings within and beyond the field of RMDs. Results Of 567 articles relating to RMDs, 55 met the inclusion criteria and were analysed, as well as 55 articles in other medical fields. The mean number of data points was 746 million (range 2000-5 billion) in RMDs, and 9.1 billion (range 100 000-200 billion) outside of RMDs. Data sources were varied: in RMDs, 26 (47%) were clinical, 8 (15%) biological and 16 (29%) radiological. Both traditional and AI methods were used to analyse big data (respectively, 10 (18%) and 45 (82%) in RMDs and 8 (15%) and 47 (85%) out of RMDs). Machine learning represented 97% of AI methods in RMDs and among these methods, the most represented was artificial neural network (20/44 articles in RMDs). Conclusions Big data sources and types are varied within the field of RMDs, and methods used to analyse big data were heterogeneous.

Keeping in view the purpose of the study, the research framework for the study is descriptive. Firstly, Primary data is collected through questionnaires from individuals engaged with public sector organizations. Secondly, unstructured interviews conducted to explore the effect of Artificial intelligence. Through research analysis, the empirical evidence suggest that the innovation activity is intrigued with important conditions responsible for the performance of public sector organization. Political instability suggested negative significance while others have demonstrated positive significance concerning innovation reforms. Artificial Intelligence also demonstrates a strong scope for future public sector organizations. In the following research framework, the data is based on the judgments of employees engaged with public sector organizations. The responses are individual self-reported and not objective, so there is a fair possibility that response would be biased. Furthermore, the responses are from Pakistan's main cities which cannot be generalized to various countries. This study focuses on the performance of the public sector organization. A large amount of literature has emerged on the likelihood of innovation reforms for private sector firms over the course of time. This paper is widening the horizon to study the likelihood of innovation reforms for public sector organizations by adhering the innovation culture and identifying important factors which may influence. The paper also provides a base for finding more dimensions to implement innovation reforms and also guide policymakers to execute efficient policies. Furthermore, the study is based on questions covering what and how dimensions. This type of quantitative study lacks for why dimension. Therefore, semi-structured interviews and case analysis could explain more regarding innovation reforms. The research framework is the first attempt to examine the impact of different conditions on the implementation of innovation and Artificial intelligence influence in public sector organizations in Pakistan.;;;;Abbas, Sayyed Khawar/V-4089-2017;Abbas, Sayyed Khawar/0000-0001-7179-1899;;;;;;;;;;;;2454-7190;0973-8975;;;;JUN;2019;14;3;;;;;540;554;;10.26782/jmcms.2019.06.00040;;;;;;;WOS:000495094500040;;;;;;

J;Linarelli, J;;;;Linarelli, John;;;Artificial General Intelligence and Contract;UNIFORM LAW REVIEW;;;;;;;;;;;;The aim of this article is to inquire whether contract law can operate in a state of affairs in which artificial general intelligence (AGI) exists and has the cognitive abilities to interact with humans to exchange promises or otherwise engage in the sorts of exchanges typically governed by contract law. AGI is a long way off, but its emergence may be sudden and come in the lifetimes of some people who are alive today. How might contract law adapt to a situation in which at least one of the contract parties could, from the standpoint of a capacity to engage in promising and exchange, be an AGI? This is not a situation in which artificial intelligence (AI) operates as an agent of a human or a firm, a frequent occurrence right now. Rather, the question is whether an AGI could constitute a principal-a contract party on its own. Contract law is a good place to start a discussion about adapting the law for an AGI future because it already incorporates a version of what is known as weak AI in its objective standard for contract formation and interpretation. Contract law, in some limited sense, takes on issues of relevance from the philosophy of the mind. AGI holds the potential to transform a solution to an epistemological problem of how to prove a contract exists into solution to an ontological problem about the capacity to contract. An objection might be that contract law presupposes the existence of a person who the law recognizes as possessing the capacity to contract. Contract law itself may not be able to answer the prior question of legally recognized person hood. The answer will be to focus on how AGI cognitive architecture could be designed for compatibility for human interaction. This article focuses on that question as well.;;;;;Linarelli, John/0000-0002-4236-9709;;;;;;;;;;;;1124-3694;2050-9065;;;;JUN;2019;24;2;;;;;330;347;;10.1093/ulr/unz015;;;;;;;WOS:000493398700007;;;;;;
J;Brkan, M;;;;Brkan, Maja;;;Do algorithms rule the world? Algorithmic decision-making and data protection in the framework of the GDPR and beyond;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY;;;;;;;;;;;;The purpose of this article is to analyse the rules of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Directive on Data Protection in Criminal Matters on automated decision-making and to explore how to ensure transparency of such decisions, in particular those taken with the help of algorithms. Both legal acts impose limitations on automated individual decision-making, including profiling. While these limitations of automated decisions might come across as a forceful fortress strongly protecting individuals and potentially even hampering the future development of Artificial Intelligence in decision-making, the relevant provisions nevertheless contain numerous exceptions allowing for such decisions. While the Directive on Data Protection in Criminal Matters worryingly does not seem to give the data subject the possibility to familiarize herself with the reasons for such a decision, the GDPR obliges the controller to provide the data subject with 'meaningful information about the logic involved' (Articles 13(2)(f), 14(2)(g) and 15(1)(h)), thus raising the much-debated question whether the data subject should be granted a 'right to explanation' of the automated decision. This article seeks to go beyond the semantic question of whether this right should be designated as the 'right to explanation' and argues that the GDPR obliges the controller to inform the data subject of the reasons why an automated decision was taken. While such a right would in principle fit well within the broader framework of the GDPR's quest for a high level of transparency, it also raises several queries: What exactly needs to be revealed to the data subject? How can an algorithm-based decision be explained? The article aims to explore these questions and to identify challenges for further research regarding explainability of automated decisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0967-0769;1464-3693;;;;SUM;2019;27;2;;;;;91;121;;10.1093/ijlit/eay017;;;;;;;WOS:000493119500001;;;;;;

Complex statistical algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being used to automate decision-making and are having a significant impact on individuals' rights and obligations. Controversies have emerged regarding the opaque nature of such schemes, the unintentional bias against and harm to under-represented populations, and the broader legal, social and ethical ramifications. State v Loomis, a recent case in the USA, well demonstrates how unrestrained and unchecked outsourcing of public power to machines may undermine human rights and the rule of law. With a close examination of the case, this article unpacks the issues of the 'legal black box' and the 'technical black box' to identify the risks posed by rampant 'algorithmization' of government functions to due process, equal protection and transparency. We further assess some important governance proposals and suggest ways for improving the accountability of AI-facilitated decisions. As AI systems are commonly employed in consequential settings across jurisdictions, technologically informed governance models are needed to locate optimal institutional designs that strike a balance between the benefits and costs of algorithmization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0967-0769;1464-3693;;;;SUM;2019;27;2;;;;;122;141;;10.1093/ijlit/eaz001;;;;;;;WOS:000493119500002;;;;;;
J;Schonberger, D;;;;Schonberger, Daniel;;;Artificial intelligence in healthcare: a critical analysis of the legal and ethical implications;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY;;;;;;;;;;;;Artificial intelligence (AI) is perceived as the most transformative technology of the 21st century. Healthcare has been identified as an early candidate to be revolutionized by AI technologies. Various clinical and patient-facing applications have already reached healthcare practice with the potential to ease the pressure on healthcare staff, bring down costs and ultimately improve the lives of patients. However, various concerns have been raised as regards the unique properties and risks inherent to AI technologies. This article aims at providing an early stage contribution with a holistic view on the 'decision-making' capacities of AI technologies. The possible ethical and legal ramifications will be discussed against the backdrop of the existing frameworks. I will conclude that the present structures are largely fit to deal with the challenges AI technologies are posing. In some areas, sector-specific revisions of the law may be advisable, particularly concerning non-discrimination and product liability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0967-0769;1464-3693;;;;SUM;2019;27;2;;;;;171;203;;10.1093/ijlit/eaz004;;;;;;;WOS:000493119500004;;;;;;
J;Himmelreich, J;;;;Himmelreich, Johannes;;;Responsibility for Killer Robots;ETHICAL THEORY AND MORAL PRACTICE;;;;;;;;;;;;Future weapons will make life-or-death decisions without a human in the loop. When such weapons inflict unwarranted harm, no one appears to be responsible. There seems to be a responsibility gap. I first reconstruct the argument for such responsibility gaps to then argue that this argument is not sound. The argument assumes that commanders have no control over whether autonomous weapons inflict harm. I argue against this assumption. Although this investigation concerns a specific case of autonomous weapons systems, I take steps towards vindicating the more general idea that superiors can be morally responsible in virtue of being in command.;;;;;Himmelreich, Johannes/0000-0002-2163-0082;;;;;;;;;;;;1386-2820;1572-8447;;;;JUN;2019;22;3;;;SI;;731;747;;10.1007/s10677-019-10007-9;;;;;;;WOS:000490946600015;;;;;;

In particular, from the Great East Japan Eartquake in March 2011, Japan has suffered from the highest frequency of disasters (floods, earthquakes, etc.) and the single largest external force (tsunami) that have not been experienced before. For such disasters of the maximum frequency, the hard and soft countermeasures alone have limitations and it is critical to integrate and appropriately harmonize them with various disaster prevention systems. The purpose of this study is to develop a flood risk management information system to support natural disaster mitigation measures. The main function of the disaster prevention support system is to select the most similar one to a typhoon before landing based on past typhoon data and artificial intelligence (AI) technology and to present guidelines for prior disaster prevention activities according to various disaster factors caused by the selected typhoon (e.g., water level and river flow rate). A database was constructed for 189 typhoons that directly or indirectly affected the target area among those that occurred between 1950 and 2017, and a system was developed by applying AI technologies such as Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Dropout. The main parameters of this database are typhoon route, central pressure, moving speed, precipitation, water level, and flow rate. For the grid sizes of the model, 2 degrees and 1 degrees in longitude and in latitude were considered. The system search results showed the highest reliability of the model at the grid size of 1 degrees when only typhoon route, center pressure, and moving speed were considered compared to the results of considering other parameters.;;;;;KIM, Yeonjoong/0000-0002-9456-7432;;;;;;;;;;;;0749-0208;1551-5036;;;;SUM;2019;;;;;91;;186;190;;10.2112/SI91-038.1;;;;;;;WOS:000485724400038;;;;;;

For brewing, they have been explored to develop rapid methods to assess product quality and acceptability. Different beers (N = 17) were analyzed in triplicates using a robotic pourer, RoboBEER (University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia), to assess 15 color and foam-related parameters using computer-vision. Those samples were tested using sensory analysis for acceptability of carbonation mouthfeel, bitterness, flavor and overall liking with 30 consumers using a 9-point hedonic scale. ANN models were developed using 17 different training algorithms with 15 color and foam-related parameters as inputs and liking of four descriptors obtained from consumers as targets. Each algorithm was tested using five, seven and ten neurons and compared to select the best model based on correlation coefficients, slope and performance (mean squared error (MSE). Bayesian Regularization algorithm with seven neurons presented the best correlation (R = 0.98) and highest performance (MSE = 0.03) with no overfitting. These models may be used as a cost-effective method for fast-screening of beers during processing to assess acceptability more efficiently. The use of RoboBEER, computer-vision algorithms and ANN will allow the implementation of an artificial intelligence system for the brewing industry to assess its effectiveness.;;;;"Viejo, Claudia Gonzalez/Q-9007-2019; Torrico, Damir Dennis/T-5690-2019; Fuentes, Sigfredo/J-6238-2015";"Viejo, Claudia Gonzalez/0000-0001-9207-9307; Torrico, Damir Dennis/0000-0003-1482-2438; Fuentes, Sigfredo/0000-0002-0377-5085";;;;;;;;;;;;2306-5710;;;;;JUN;2019;5;2;;;;;;;33;10.3390/beverages5020033;;;;;;;WOS:000477920100007;;;;;;

Complex analysis of large-scale accidents at power facilities is performed, and their causes and damages are determined. There is substantiated topicality of building condition knowledge-bases as the foundation for developing decision-support systems in power engineering. The top priorities of the research include developing methods of building a knowledge base based on intensity models of control actions influencing the parameters of power system conditions and introducing the smart system into information contours of the automated dispatch control system (ADCS), as well as assessing practical results of the research. To achieve these goals, the authors apply methods of experiment planning, artificial intelligence, knowledge presentation, mathematical simulation, and mathematical statistics as well as methods of power systems studying. The basic research results include regression models of a power system sensitivity to control actions, methods of building a knowledge base based on the models of sensitivity matrices, a structure of the smart decision-support system, a scheme of introducing the decision-support system into the operating ADCS environment. The problem of building a knowledge base of the dispatch decision-support system on the basis of empirical data resulted from calculating experiments on the system diagram has been solved.

An accurate estimation of heating and cooling load leads to better management of energy related tasks and progressing towards an energy efficient building. With increasing global energy demands and buildings being major energy consuming entities, there is renewed interest in studying the energy performance of buildings.

J;"How, ML; Hung, WLD";;;;"How, Meng-Leong; Hung, Wei Loong David";;;Educational Stakeholders' Independent Evaluation of an Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Adaptive Learning System Using Bayesian Network Predictive Simulations;EDUCATION SCIENCES;;;;;;;;;;;;Artificial intelligence-enabled adaptive learning systems (AI-ALS) are increasingly being deployed in education to enhance the learning needs of students. However, educational stakeholders are required by policy-makers to conduct an independent evaluation of the AI-ALS using a small sample size in a pilot study, before that AI-ALS can be approved for large-scale deployment. Beyond simply believing in the information provided by the AI-ALS supplier, there arises a need for educational stakeholders to independently understand the motif of the pedagogical characteristics that underlie the AI-ALS. Laudable efforts were made by researchers to engender frameworks for the evaluation of AI-ALS. Nevertheless, those highly technical techniques often require advanced mathematical knowledge or computer programming skills. There remains a dearth in the extant literature for a more intuitive way for educational stakeholders-rather than computer scientists-to carry out the independent evaluation of an AI-ALS to understand how it could provide opportunities to educe the problem-solving abilities of the students so that they can successfully learn the subject matter. This paper proffers an approach for educational stakeholders to employ Bayesian networks to simulate predictive hypothetical scenarios with controllable parameters to better inform them about the suitability of the AI-ALS for the students.;;;;;How, Meng-Leong/0000-0003-2845-0292;;;;;;;;;;;;2227-7102;;;;;JUN;2019;9;2;;;;;;;110;10.3390/educsci9020110;;;;;;;WOS:000475301900044;;;;;;
J;"How, ML; Hung, WLD";;;;"How, Meng-Leong; Hung, Wei Loong David";;;Harnessing Entropy via Predictive Analytics to Optimize Outcomes in the Pedagogical System: An Artificial Intelligence-Based Bayesian Networks Approach;EDUCATION SCIENCES;;;;;;;;;;;;Educational stakeholders would be better informed if they could use their students' formative assessments results and personal background attributes to predict the conditions for achieving favorable learning outcomes, and conversely, to gain awareness of the at-risk signals to prevent unfavorable or worst-case scenarios from happening. It remains, however, quite challenging to simulate predictive counterfactual scenarios and their outcomes, especially if the sample size is small, or if a baseline control group is unavailable. To overcome these constraints, the current paper proffers a Bayesian Networks approach to visualize the dynamics of the spread of energy within a pedagogical system, so that educational stakeholders, rather than computer scientists, can also harness entropy to work for them. The paper uses descriptive analytics to investigate what has already happened? in the collected data, followed by predictive analytics with controllable parameters to simulate outcomes of what-if? scenarios in the experimental Bayesian Network computational model to visualize how effects spread when interventions are applied. The conceptual framework and analytical procedures in this paper could be implemented using Bayesian Networks software, so that educational researchers and stakeholders would be able to use their own schools' data and produce findings to inform and advance their practice.;;;;;How, Meng-Leong/0000-0003-2845-0292;;;;;;;;;;;;2227-7102;;;;;JUN;2019;9;2;;;;;;;158;10.3390/educsci9020158;;;;;;;WOS:000475301900092;;;;;;

While this volume of data leads to robust models, it often results in difficult to manage, slow-running numerical flow models. To dramatically reduce the numerical run-times associated with the traditional simulation techniques, this work investigated the feasibility of using artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to develop a smart proxy model of the Scurry Area Canyon Reef Operators Committee (SACROC) oilfield, located in the Permian Basin, TX, USA. Smart proxy models can be used to facilitate injection-production optimization for CO2-EOR projects. The use of a coupled grid-based, and well-based surrogate reservoir model (SRM) (also known as smart proxy modeling) was investigated as the base of the optimization. A fit-for-purpose coupled SRM, which executes in seconds, was built based on high-resolution numerical reservoir simulation models of the northern platform of the SACROC oilfield. This study is unique as it is the first application of coupled SRM at a large oilfield. The developed SRM was able to identify the dynamic reservoir properties (pressure, saturations, and component mole-fraction) at every grid-block, along with the production characteristics (pressure and rate) at each well. Recent attempts to use machine learning and pattern recognition to build proxy models have been simplistic, with limited predictive capabilities. The geological model used in this study is comprised of more than nine million grid blocks. The high correlation between the actual component and SRM, which can be visualized by mapping the properties, along with the fast footprint of the developed model demonstrate the successful application of this methodology.;;;;;Mohaghegh, Shahab/0000-0002-4148-4051;;;;;;;;;;;;2311-5521;;;;;JUN;2019;4;2;;;;;;;85;10.3390/fluids4020085;;;;;;;WOS:000475331700027;;;;;;

While gathering a huge amount of medical data, the problems will appear on the classification of healthcare data. In this work, a fuzzy hybridised convolutional neural network (FCNN) model is stated to guess the class of healthcare data. This model collects the information from the data set and builds the decision table based on the collected features from data sets. The attributes that are unrelated are deleted by using principal component analysis algorithm. The decision of normal and cardiac disease is described by using FCNN classifier. Using the data sets from UCI (University of California Irvine) repository the estimation of the presented model is carried on. The performance of the authors' classification technique is measured by various metrics such as accuracy, F-measure, G-mean, precision, and recall. The experimental results while compared with some of the existing machine learning methods such as probabilistic neural network, support vector machine and neural network, show the higher performance of FCNN. This model presented in this work acts as a decision support pattern in healthcare for therapeutic specialists.;;;;Zubar, Abdul Zubar H/D-3262-2015;Zubar, Abdul Zubar H/0000-0002-5303-6782;;;;;;;;;;;;2053-3713;;;;;JUN;2019;6;3;;;;;59;63;;10.1049/htl.2018.5046;;;;;;;WOS:000474653600002;31341629;;;;;

Genetic Programming (GP) is the first and best-known automatic programming technique that is applied to solve many practical problems. Artificial Bee Colony Programming (ABCP) is one of the latest proposed automatic programming method that combines evolutionary approach with swarm intelligence. GP is an extension version of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and ABCP is based on Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. The main differences of these automatic programing techniques and their conventional algorithms (GA and ABC) are modeling solution. In ABC same as GA, the solutions are represented fixed code blocks. In GP and ABCP, the positions of food sources are expressed in tree structure that is composed of different combinations of terminals and functions that are specifically defined as problems. This paper presents a review on GP and ABCP and they are worked in symbolic regression, prediction and feature selection problems which are widely tackled by researchers. The results of the ABCP compared with results of GP show that this algorithm is a powerful optimization technique for structural design.;;;;"ARSLAN, SIBEL/AAL-4458-2020; Ozturk, Celal/A-8961-2012";"ARSLAN, SIBEL/0000-0003-3626-553X; Ozturk, Celal/0000-0003-3798-8123";;;;;;;;;;;;0350-5596;;;;;JUN;2019;43;2;;;;;281;289;;10.31449/inf.v43i2.2133;;;;;;;WOS:000475745500012;;;;;;

Evidence Using Artificial Intelligence;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES;;;;;;;;;;;;Despite the number of studies on bankruptcy prediction using financial ratios, very little is known about how external audit information can contribute to anticipating financial distress. A handful of papers have shown that a combination of ratios and audit data is significant for predictive purposes, but only one recent paper provided a predictive accuracy of 80% solely by using the disclosures contained in audit reports. This study was complemented by simplifying the analysis of audit reports for prediction purposes and the same predictive accuracy was achieved. By applying three artificial intelligence techniques (PART algorithm, random forest, and support vector machine), the predictive ability of more easily extracted information from the report was examined and a practical implication suggested for each user. Simply by (1) finding the audit opinion, (2) identifying if a matter section exists, and (3) the number of comments disclosed, any user may predict a bankruptcy situation with the same accuracy as if they had scrutinized the whole report. In addition, an extended literature review is included, on previous studies on the interaction between bankruptcy prediction and the external audit information.;;;;"Munoz-Izquierdo, Nora/Z-5968-2019; SEGOVIA-VARGAS, MARIA-JESUS/I-3637-2017";"Munoz-Izquierdo, Nora/0000-0001-8615-7778; SEGOVIA-VARGAS, MARIA-JESUS/0000-0002-6578-8017";;;;;;;;;;;;2227-7072;;;;;JUN;2019;7;2;;;;;;;20;10.3390/ijfs7020020;;;;;;;WOS:000474931600003;;;;;;

J;Van Rompaey, L;;;;Van Rompaey, Leonard;;;Shifting from Autonomous Weapons to Military Networks;JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LEGAL STUDIES;;;;;;;;;;;;The persistent anthropomorphism of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) as the replacement for human soldiers creates irrelevant expectations of physical embodiment and cognitive individualization. This anthropomorphism taints the analysis and discussions on the adaptation of international humanitarian law (IHL) by excluding relevant technologies from the scope of discussions. Shifting from LAWS to a network-centric sociotechnical systems perspective allows to remedy the under inclusiveness of the laws perspective by shifting away from the salient features of LAWS, in favour of a focus on the interactions with, and influence that the technology has on human decision-making in warfare. By criticizing the relevance of the technological focus of the current diplomatic process, the paper argues that the network-centric perspective is not only more accurate, but also more helpful and practical in adapting ihl to the armed conflicts of the twenty-first century.;;;;;Van Rompaey, Leonard/0000-0003-0427-4976;;;;;;;;;;;;1878-1373;1878-1527;;;;JUN;2019;10;1;;;;;111;128;;10.1163/18781527-01001011;;;;;;;WOS:000475860600007;;;;;;
J;Maas, MM;;;;Maas, Matthijs M.;;;Innovation-Proof Global Governance for Military Artificial Intelligence? How I Learned to Stop Worrying, and Love the Bot;JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LEGAL STUDIES;;;;;;;;;;;;Amidst fears over artificial intelligence 'arms races', much of the international debate on governing military uses of AI is still focused on preventing the use of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS). Yet 'killer robots' hardly exhaust the potentially problematic capabilities that innovation in military AI (MAI) is set to unlock. Governance initiatives narrowly focused on preserving 'meaningful human control' over laws therefore risk being bypassed by the technological state-of-the-art. This paper departs from the question: how can we formulate 'innovation-proof governance' approaches that are resilient or adaptive to future developments in military AI? I develop a typology for the ways in which mai innovation can disrupt existing international legal frameworks. This includes 'direct' disruption - as new types of mai capabilities elude categorization under existing regimes - as well as 'indirect' disruption, where new capabilities shift the risk landscape of military AI, or change the incentives or values of the states developing them. After discussing two potential objections to 'innovation-proof governance', I explore the advantages and shortcomings of three possible approaches to innovation-proof governance for military AI. While no definitive blueprint is offered, I suggest key considerations for governance strategies that seek to ensure that military AI remains lawful, ethical, stabilizing, and safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1878-1373;1878-1527;;;;JUN;2019;10;1;;;;;129;157;;10.1163/18781527-01001006;;;;;;;WOS:000475860600008;;;;;;
J;Schaub, G;;;;Schaub, Gary, Jr.;;;Controlling the Autonomous Warrior Institutional and Agent-Based Approaches to Future Air Power;JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LEGAL STUDIES;;;;;;;;;;;;The challenges posed by weapons with autonomous functions are not a tabula rasa. The capabilities of both State principals and military agents to control and channel violence for political purposes have improved across the centuries as technology has increased the range and lethality of weapons as well as the scope of warfare. The institutional relations between principals and agents have been adapted to account for, and take advantage of, these developments. Air forces encompass one realm where distance, speed, and lethality have been subjected to substantial and effective control. Air forces are also where systems with autonomous functionality will likely drive the most visible adaptation to command and control arrangements. This process will spread across other domains as States pursue institution-centric and agent-centric strategies to secure meaningful human control over artificial agents as they become increasingly capable of replacing human agents in military (and other) functions. Agent-centric approaches that consider emergent behaviour as akin to human judgment and institutional approaches that improve the ability to understand, interrogate, monitor, and audit the decisions and behaviour of artificial agents can together drive improvements in meaningful human control over warfare, just as previous adaptations have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1878-1373;1878-1527;;;;JUN;2019;10;1;;;;;184;202;;10.1163/18781527-01001007;;;;;;;WOS:000475860600011;;;;;;

Using experimental fitness data and implementing artificial intelligence and a computational mutagenesis technique, we developed models that reliably predict fitness for all single residue mutants of H-ras proto-oncogene protein p21. The computational mutagenesis generated a feature vector of protein structural changes for each variant, and these data correlated well with fitness. Random forest classification and tree regression machine learning algorithms were implemented for training predictive models. Cross-validations were used to evaluate model performance, and control experiments were performed to assess statistical significance. Classification models revealed a balanced accuracy rate as high as 82%, with a Matthew's correlation of 0.63, and an area under ROC curve of 0.90. Similarly, regression models displayed Pearson's correlation reaching 0.79. On the other hand, control data sets led to performance values consistent with random guessing. Comparisons with several related state-of-the-art methods reflected favorably on our trained models. This H-Ras proof-of-principle study suggests a complementary approach for understanding mechanisms with which other proteins are involved in oncogenesis, including related Ras isoforms, and for providing useful insights into designing future diagnostic and treatment modalities.;;;;;, Arnav/0000-0002-6805-2814;;;;;;;;;;;;2405-8440;;;;;JUN;2019;5;6;;;;;;;e01884;10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01884;;;;;;;WOS:000473818300091;31211262;;;;;

The objective of BDFIG control is to achieve better performance compared to the doubly fed induction generator using the well-established vector control method. Control of a BDFIG with back-to-back PWM converters using an artificial intelligence approach, fuzzy PID controller, is proposed for a BDFIG-based variable speed wind energy conversion system. The proposed controller is adaptive in the manner that the controller parameters are modified online by using the fuzzy control rules. Comparative performance of the BDFIG with the proposed fuzzy PID controller and the conventional fixed-parameters PID controller under various operating speeds, stator reactive power references and a 100% voltage dip is investigated. Results of simulation studies using MATLAB((R)) reported in the paper show that the limitations of the conventional PID controller can have negative effects on both quality and quantity of the generated power. Performance of the system can be improved with the proposed adaptive fuzzy PID controller under dynamic conditions.;;;;TIR, Zoheir/I-8364-2015;TIR, Zoheir/0000-0002-5793-5179;;;;;;;;;;;;0975-6809;0976-4348;;;;JUN;2019;10;3;;;;;326;338;;10.1007/s13198-019-00772-2;;;;;;;WOS:000474561200003;;;;;;

The estimation of their hydrodynamic characteristics is conventionally done using physical models, subjecting to higher costs and prolonged procedures. Soft computing methods prove to be useful tools, in cases where the data availability from physical models is limited. The present paper employs adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural network (ANN) models to the data obtained from physical model studies to develop a novel methodology to predict the reflection coefficient (K-r) of seaside perforated semicircular breakwaters under low wave heights, for which no physical model data is available. The prediction was done using the input parameters viz., incident wave height (H-i), wave period (T), center-to-center spacing of perforations (S), diameter of perforations (D), radius of semicircular caisson (R), water depth (d), and semicircular breakwater structure height (h(s)). The study shows the prediction below the available data range of wave heights is possible by ANFIS and ANN models. However, the ANFIS performed better with R-2=0.9775 and the error reduced in comparison with the ANN model with R-2=0.9751.

Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. MANETs are more susceptible to the security attacks because of the node mobility which imposes a set of challenges security issues. To tackle these security issues, such as the use of encryption and authentication techniques, have been proposed as a first line of defense to reduce the risk of security problems. However, such risks cannot be completely eliminated, there is a strong need of intrusion detection systems (IDS) as a second line of defense for securing MANET. An intrusion-detection system (IDS) can be defined as the tools, methods, and resources to help identify, assess, and report unauthorized or unapproved network activity. Machine learning based intrusion detection approaches must be deployed and elaborated to facilitate the identification of attacks and enables system to make decisions on intrusion while continuing to learn about their mobile environment.

The first letter of each rubric taken together conveniently generates the acronym FIRST. Special attention is given to the rubrics of functionality and inherent significance given the centrality of the former and the tendency to neglect the latter in virtue of its somewhat nebulous and contested character. In addition to exploring some illustrative issues arising under each rubric, the article also emphasizes a number of more general themes. These include: the multiplicity of interacting levels on which ethical questions about RAIs arise, the need to recognise that RAIs potentially implicate the full gamut of human values (rather than exclusively or primarily some readily identifiable sub-set of ethical or legal principles), and the need for practically salient ethical reflection on RAIs to be informed by a realistic appreciation of their existing and foreseeable capacities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2051-655X;;;;;JUN;2019;7;1;;;;;61;95;;;;;;;;;WOS:000473621300006;;;;;;

The proposed protection technique consists of two dependant approaches. The first approach is fault detector algorithm that using adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system as an artificial intelligence technique to detect the fault occurrence and its location. The second approach is implementation of Egyptian LVRT grid code to discriminate between tripping or not tripping decision for faulted wind turbine generators based on fault conditions such as its duration and voltage level. The proposed protection technique is applied on a simulation model of 200 MW Gabal El-Zayt wind farm, which located in Red Sea region and connected to Egyptian electrical grid. The studied wind farm consists of 100 DFIG wind turbines, and each generator has a capacity of 2 MW. The simulation model of studied wind farm is implemented by using MATLAB/SIMULINK toolboxes to demonstrate the performance of proposed protection technique. The impacts of fault duration, fault type, internal and external fault locations on the behaviour of studied wind farm equipped with the proposed protection technique are investigated. Also, the impacts of grid voltage sag and different ground transition resistances on the performance of proposed protection technique are investigated. The simulation results show that, the proposed protection technique can detect and isolate the faulted area according to Egyptian LVRT grid code requirements for enhancement the stability of studied wind farm.;;;;Hamdan, Ibrahim/ABD-2987-2020;"Hamdan, Ibrahim/0000-0002-9860-4739; Noureldeen, Omar/0000-0001-7272-4620";;;;;;;;;;;;2523-3963;2523-3971;;;;JUN;2019;1;6;;;;;;;515;10.1007/s42452-019-0538-9;;;;;;;WOS:000473663000007;;;;;;

Important aspects of the evolving or, better to say, digital-technological race, which influence strategic stability, may have a profound effect on the character, model, scales, instruments of arms deterrence, and on the perspectives of the arms control system as a whole. The main hypothesis of the work is as follows. High dynamics of the innovation-digital development is one of the key factors which determine the inevitability of the appearance of a new conceptual approach to the arms control and new forms of deterrence. The last, for an example, may be called a hybrid deterrence, including asymmetric threats deterrence, cyber deterrence, deterrence in space and deterrence by denial. The necessity to consider revolutionary and incremental innovations as important elements of national military power and international security is noted. Special attention is given to the perspectives of development and use of Big Data, automation, quantum computers, artificial intelligence, including such transforming, so-called traditional (incremental) technologies as hypersonic vehicles (for example). Interactions and integrations of the revolutionary and evolutional technologies in their influence on strategic stability and different sorts of arms deterrence are on the rise. It is suggested that such circumstances, with increasing complexity and a systemic character of the strategic deterrence environment, may lead to formation of the united universal arms deterrence in the future. The main characters of this universal system would be the eroding borders between different deterrence types and transfer of tasks between them: for instance, between nuclear and conventional weapons.;;;;"Gusarova, Olga/C-7661-2014; Pankova, Ludmila/ABG-7662-2020";"Pankova, Ludmila/0000-0003-3500-4741; Gusarova, Olga/0000-0001-5414-0365";;;;;;;;;;;;0131-2227;;;;;JUN;2019;63;6;;;;;70;83;;10.20542/0131-2227-2019-63-6-70-83;;;;;;;WOS:000472650800007;;;;;;
J;"Aruka, Y; Nakajima, Y; Mori, N";;;;"Aruka, Yuji; Nakajima, Yoshihiro; Mori, Naoki";;;An examination of market mechanism with redundancies motivated by Turing's rule selection;EVOLUTIONARY AND INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS REVIEW;;;;;;;;;;;;With the advent of the new era of Artificial Intelligence, we need to update our inferential methods in economics and the social sciences accordingly. The implementation of a slightly realistic consideration will easily reveal to us a very large domain. In this article, we employ the AI market simulation system called U-Mart to model the efficiency of a realistic futures market. In the actual market, participating agents send orders either randomly or non-intelligently, even though they depend on their own unambiguous strategies. It has been noted that purely random orders often result in the best performance in the market. Thus, the market system may have many redundancies. Although we cannot know in advance an optimal solution in advance, we may form a winning strategy. In a sense different from efficiency market hypothesis, we can thus affirm a certain statement on the efficiency of the market. This kind of analysis is essentially similar to the idea of Fully Random, Rule-Based Interactive Cellular Automata (ICA), which is based on Alan Turing's rule selection. Based on this hint, we can now find a particular agent set to realize a futures price series almost similar to the spot price series. This agent configuration set has been already identified by Nakajima and Mori (Design of experimental environment for artificial financial market. Mimeo, New York, 2005) and may provide us with a special reference point like the fundamentals. Thus, we call this set the standard agent configuration (StdAC). It should be noted that the traditional fundamentals are not internally decided by the market. On the other side, StdAC will play its role as the fundamentals of price formation. We finally employ this set to detect a critical configuration from where the futures price series is divergent. Thus, we confirm a new approach to study market mechanism in this context.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1349-4961;2188-2096;;;;JUN;2019;16;1;2;;;;19;42;;10.1007/s40844-018-0115-8;;;;;;;WOS:000472597200002;;;;;;
J;Chiao, V;;;;Chiao, Vincent;;;Fairness, accountability and transparency: notes on algorithmic decision-making in criminal justice;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW IN CONTEXT;;;;;;;;;;;;Over the last few years, legal scholars, policy-makers, activists and others have generated a vast and rapidly expanding literature concerning the ethical ramifications of using artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data and predictive software in criminal justice contexts. These concerns can be clustered under the headings of fairness, accountability and transparency. First, can we trust technology to be fair, especially given that the data on which the technology is based are biased in various ways? Second, whom can we blame if the technology goes wrong, as it inevitably will on occasion? Finally, does it matter if we do not know how an algorithm works or, relatedly, cannot understand how it reached its decision? I argue that, while these are serious concerns, they are not irresolvable. More importantly, the very same concerns of fairness, accountability and transparency apply, with even greater urgency, to existing modes of decision-making in criminal justice. The question, hence, is comparative: can algorithmic modes of decision-making improve upon the status quo in criminal justice? There is unlikely to be a categorical answer to this question, although there are some reasons for cautious optimism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1744-5523;1744-5531;;;;JUN;2019;15;2;;;SI;;126;139;PII S1744552319000077;10.1017/S1744552319000077;;;;;;;WOS:000472196600002;;;;;;

This paper begins by arguing that, since such efforts amount to an attempt to channel human conduct, they should be regarded as a form of regulation that is subject to rule-of-law principles. The paper then discusses three sets of rule-of-law issues. The first set concerns enforceability. Here, the paper highlights the displacement effects that have resulted from the automated removal and blocking of terrorist content and argues that regard must be had to the whole social-media ecology, as well as to jihadist groups other than the so-called Islamic State and other forms of violent extremism. Since rule by law is only a necessary, and not a sufficient, condition for compliance with rule-of-law values, the paper then goes on to examine two further sets of issues: the clarity with which social-media companies define terrorist content and the adequacy of the processes by which a user may appeal against an account suspension or the blocking or removal of content. The paper concludes by identifying a range of research questions that emerge from the discussion and that together form a promising and timely research agenda to which legal scholarship has much to contribute.;;;;;Giro Correia, Sara/0000-0003-0261-6872;;;;;;;;;;;;1744-5523;1744-5531;;;;JUN;2019;15;2;;;SI;;183;197;;10.1017/S1744552319000119;;;;;;;WOS:000472196600006;;;;;;

The rapid development in the fields of science, especially artificial intelligence, cloning, and stem cell technology, is making our lives more convenient; however, it is also giving rise to a plethora of new ethical issues. Further, weakening of organized religions, moral depravity, and loss of societal values are making society more complex and vulnerable. In such a context, what would be the mission of the church in the contemporary world? How can the church help those who are seeking to know the meaning of their lives? Christians believe that the Holy Spirit is the protagonist in the life of the church. How can the church be truly Spirit led in fulfilling its mission in the world?

The primary drivers within this agenda relate to improved environmental metrics, efficient energy performance, and improved asset management. However, the integration of new technologies always presents technical and financial risks. Here, utilising energy and environmental monitoring from real vessels, the authors propose an energy system optimisation architecture, hybrid fusion energy management system (HyFES), that optimises the key performance indicators of energy performance, reduction of diesel engine nitrogen oxide (NOx), and particulate matter (PM), and prognostic state of health assessment of energy storage technologies. Using state of the art machine-learning techniques, the authors are able to determine the on-board lithium-ion and lead acid batteries' state of health with accuracy > 8 and 4%, respectively. Dependent on the mode of operation, optimisation of energy performance indicates fuel saving of between 70 and 80% for the vessel operator. Future research will focus on the integration of more assets into the optimisation architecture and increased vessel journey use cases.;;;;Robu, Valentin/AAS-6994-2020;"Robu, Valentin/0000-0002-9280-2072; Flynn, David/0000-0002-1024-3618";;;;;;;;;;;;2051-3305;;;;;JUN;2019;;17;;;;;4516;4521;;10.1049/joe.2018.8232;;;;;;;WOS:000472719600203;;;;;;

J;Marrella, A;;;;Marrella, Andrea;;;Automated Planning for Business Process Management;JOURNAL ON DATA SEMANTICS;;;;;;;;;;;;Business Process Management (BPM) is a central element of today's organizations. Over the years, its main focus has been the support of business processes (BPs) in highly controlled domains. Howeverin the current era of Big Data and Internet-of-Thingsseveral real-world domains are becoming cyber-physical (e.g., consider the shift from traditional manufacturing to Industry 4.0), characterized by ever-changing requirements, unpredictable environments and increasing amounts of data and events that influence the enactment of BPs. In such unconstrained settings, BPM professionals lack the needed knowledge to model all possible BP variants/contingencies at the outset. Consequently, BPM systems must increase their level of automation to provide the reactivity and flexibility necessary for process management. On the other hand, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community has concentrated its efforts on investigating dynamic domains that involve active control of computational entities and physical devices (e.g., robots, software agents). In this context, automated planning, which is one of the oldest areas in AI, is conceived as a model-based approach to synthesize autonomous behaviors in automated way from a model. In this paper, we discuss how automated planning techniques can be leveraged to enable new levels of automation and support for solving concrete problems in the BPM field that were previously tackled with hard-coded solutions. To this aim, we first propose a methodology that shows how a researcher/practitioner should approach the task of encoding a concrete problem as an appropriate planning problem. Then, we discuss the required steps to integrate the planning technology in BPM environments. Finally, we show some concrete examples of the successful application of planning techniques to the different stages of the BPM life cycle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1861-2032;1861-2040;;;;JUN;2019;8;2;;;SI;;79;98;;10.1007/s13740-018-0096-0;;;;;;;WOS:000472569900002;;;;;;

Applying an image-based, neural-network approach to analyzing the acoustic signal may be an effective means for detecting and differentially diagnosing voice disorders. The purpose of this study is to provide a proof-of-concept that embedded data within human phonation can be accurately and efficiently decoded with deep learning neural network analysis to differentiate between normal and disordered voices. Methods Acoustic recordings from 10 vocally-healthy speakers, as well as 70 patients with one of seven voice disorders (n = 10 per diagnosis), were acquired from a clinical database. Acoustic signals were converted into spectrograms and used to train a convolutional neural network developed with the Keras library. The network architecture was trained separately for each of the seven diagnostic categories. Binary classification tasks (ie, to classify normal vs. disordered) were performed for each of the seven diagnostic categories. All models were validated using the 10-fold cross-validation technique. Results Binary classification averaged accuracies ranged from 58% to 90%. Models were most accurate in their classification of adductor spasmodic dysphonia, unilateral vocal fold paralysis, vocal fold polyp, polypoid corditis, and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Despite a small sample size, these findings are consistent with previously published data utilizing deep neural networks for classification of voice disorders. Conclusion Promising preliminary results support further study of deep neural networks for clinical detection and diagnosis of human voice disorders. Current models should be optimized with a larger sample size.

Homo Cyber Oeconomicus, one of the potential stages of ongoing consumer's evolution, lives between processes of dehumanization of the surrounding world and humanization of digital technologies. While remaining in a constant contact with smart devices, systems and algorithms, they are looking for new values and meanings, which are a metaphor of their desires, fears and behaviors. As a result, the digital ecosystem, as an attempt to combine the humanism idea with technologization processes, poses new challenges to companies/brands, both concerning the quality of interactions with an increasingly digital consumer and tools used in that process. Chatbots can prove to be an interesting solution here, as their spectrum of potential areas of implementation in business systematically increases. The paper attempts to identify the influence of chatbots on marketing taking into account their role in Human-to-Machine interaction process. A part of these considerations is of the character of philosophical discourse on the role of that technology in human life, which is a starting point for the presentation of preliminary assumptions for a model of consumer-chatbot interaction (digital technology) in marketing activity of companies/brands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1429-9321;2299-193X;;;;JUN;2019;23;1;;;;;251;270;;10.2478/manment-2019-0015;;;;;;;WOS:000472066400015;;;;;;

However, this new model is open to various risks, one of which is opacity. In this article, we examine the factors that may play a determining role in algorithms generating opacity in public administration. After identifying these factors, we describe the mechanisms for making algorithms more transparent, based on giving citizens access to and information about the actual contents of algorithms and their functioning. We also present the mechanisms that can be used to make public administrations accountable for any decisions taken using algorithms.

It is precisely in the EU where there is a special commitment to developing an ethics for a trustworthy AI in design and made in Europe, to position itself in front of United States and especially China, two countries that don't pay much attention to the issue. Firstly, we describe the content of ethics of AI and its essential principles from the point of view of the dignity and rights; second, we describe the main five principles contained in the international declarations. Third, we include other basic principles which arise from the demands of empathy with humans. From a somewhat sceptical perspective, we argue the potential utilities of ethics of AI for the law: it is considered to be an especially preventive instrument and that an ethical governance of AI can be developed, following the examples of policies and frameworks on public ethics and institutional integrity. The phases to be followed are described in this regard. We explain in detail the opportunity and the basic content of codes of conduct and committees and other control systems.

Governments are changing the ways in which they provide public services and intervene in society. Such changes will force them to redefine their human resources and, as a result, to take a hard look at the mechanisms in place for employee recruitment and management. Agreement has not yet been reached regarding the extent to which technological change is affecting public employment; there is consensus, however, that big data and artificial intelligence will play an essential role in carrying out certain tasks which, until now, have been performed by civil servants, who will ultimately have to develop new knowledge and skills. The generational change that governments will experience over the course of the next fifteen years will become an opportunity to transform public employment and its management as long as the benefits of technological change are leveraged and public authorities are encouraged to fulfil their duty of satisfying public interest.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1885-5709;1885-8252;;;;JUN;2019;;58;;;;;49;63;;10.2436/rcdp.i58.2019.3276;;;;;;;WOS:000472010900004;;;;;;

However, the main characteristic of DNNs is that they are computationally and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources and power budgets. To address this limitation, we introduce a new quantization method with mixed data structure and bit-shifting broadcast accelerator structure BSHIFT. These works together reduce the storage requirement of neural networks models from 32 to 5bits without affecting their accuracy. We implement BSHIFT at TSMC 16nm technology node, and the efficiency achieves 64TOPS/s per watt in our experiments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0885-7458;1573-7640;;;;JUN;2019;47;3;;;SI;;360;372;;10.1007/s10766-018-00624-9;;;;;;;WOS:000471644400003;;;;;;

Their strong demands for low-latency or real-time services make Spark, an in-memory big data computing framework, the best choice in taking place of previous disk-based big data computing. As an in-memory framework, reasonable data arrangement in storage is the key factor of performance. However, the existing cache replacement strategy and storage selection mechanism based optimizations all rely on an imprecise available memory model and will lead to negative decision. To address this issue, we propose an available memory model to capture the accurate information of to be freed memory space by sensing the dependencies between the data. And we also propose a maximum memory requirement model for execution prediction to exclude the redundancy from inactive blocks. With such two models, we build DASS, a dependency-aware storage selection mechanism for Spark to make dynamic and fine-grained storage decision. Our experiments show that compared with previous methods the DASS could effectively reduce the cost of garbage collection and RDD blocks re-computing, give better computing performance by 77.4%.;;;;;Wang, Bo/0000-0002-4684-6349;;;;;;;;;;;;0885-7458;1573-7640;;;;JUN;2019;47;3;;;SI;;502;519;;10.1007/s10766-018-0612-8;;;;;;;WOS:000471644400012;;;;;;

The program creates thousands of new patent summaries per second. Patent-Bot is itself a piece of intellectual property, which in turn exists to generate more intellectual property. Patent-Bot also invents new words in relation to its future concepts, which appear to test the current linguistic limits of innovation and communication. Patent-Bot was debuted as an interactive art installation in the Omnibus Filing exhibition at the Visual Arts Center, University of Texas at Austin. Omnibus Filing showcased artworks, inventions, prototypes and cross-disciplinary research projects undertaken by teams of scientists, artists and engineers. Patent-Bot has since exhibited at Piksel 17: A festival for Elektronisk Kunst og fri Teknologi, in Lydgalleriet, Bergen, Norway.

The logic parses collectives of expertise into 'domains' that are to be studied or engaged in order to inform computational advancements and/or interventions on the domains themselves. The concept of a domain is set against a proposition that there is a more general, domain independent or agnostic technique that can serve to intermediate the domains. This article contrasts instances of this discourse, organizing and techne, drawing from cases in artificial intelligence, software engineering, and science policy to illustrate three ongoing figurations of the logic as i) experimental research, ii) formalization in method and software tools, and iii) a de facto organizing principle for science policy and technology development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0306-3127;1460-3659;;;;JUN;2019;49;3;;;;;281;309;;10.1177/0306312719849709;;;;;;;WOS:000471326400001;31122173;;;;;
J;Hadj-Mabrouk, H;;;;Hadj-Mabrouk, Habib;;;Contribution of Artificial Intelligence to Risk Assessment of Railway Accidents;URBAN RAIL TRANSIT;;;;;;;;;;;;"In the design, development, and operation of a rail transport system, all the actors involved use one or more safety methods to identify hazardous situations, the causes of hazards, potential accidents, and the severity of the consequences that would result. The main objective is to justify and ensure that the design architecture of the transportation system is safe and presents no particular risk to users or the environment. As part of this process of certification, domain experts are responsible for reviewing the safety of the system, and are being brought in to imagine new scenarios of potential accidents to ensure the exhaustiveness of such safety studies. One of the difficulties in this process is to determine abnormal scenarios that could lead to a particular potential accident. This is the fundamental point that motivated the present work, whose objective is to develop tools to assist certification experts in their crucial task of analyzing and evaluating railway safety. However, the type of reasoning (inductive, deductive, by analogy, etc.) used by certification experts as well as the very nature of the knowledge manipulated in this certification process (symbolic, subjective, evolutionary, empirical, etc.) justify that conventional computer solutions cannot be adopted; the use of artificial intelligence (AI) methods and techniques helps to understand the problem of safety analysis and certification of high-risk systems such as guided rail transport systems. To help experts in this complex process of evaluating safety studies, we decided to use AI techniques and in particular machine learning to systematize, streamline, and strengthen conventional approaches used for safety analysis and certification.";;;;Hadj-Mabrouk, Habib/D-2851-2017;Hadj-Mabrouk, Habib/0000-0001-9322-8175;;;;;;;;;;;;2199-6687;2199-6679;;;;JUN;2019;5;2;;;;;104;122;;10.1007/s40864-019-0102-3;;;;;;;WOS:000471653400003;;;;;;

Rapid advances in handheld imaging devices with other mHealth devices such as smartphone apps and wearable devices are making great strides in the field of cardiovascular imaging like never before. Although these technologies offer a bright promise in cardiovascular imaging, it is far from straightforward. The massive data influx from telemedicine and mHealth including cardiovascular imaging supersedes the existing capabilities of current healthcare system and statistical software. Artificial intelligence with machine learning is the one and only way to navigate through this complex maze of the data influx through various approaches. Deep learning techniques are further expanding their role by image recognition and automated measurements. Artificial intelligence provides limitless opportunity to rigorously analyze data.

The authors describe a system consisting of a wireless sensor network and an algorithmic software for condition-based monitoring of electrical plant in a live substation. Specifically, the aim is to monitor for the presence of partial discharge (PD) using a matrix of inexpensive radio sensors with limited processing capability. A low-complexity fingerprinting technique is proposed, given that the sensor nodes to be deployed will be highly constrained in terms of processing power, memory and battery life. Two variants of artificial neural network (ANN) learning models (multilayer perceptron and generalised regression neural network) that use regression as a form of function approximation are developed and their performance compared to K-nearest neighbour and weighted K-nearest neighbour models. The results indicate that the ANN models yield superior performance in terms of robustness against noise and may be particularly suited for PD localisation.;;;;Tachtatzis, Christos/A-6702-2017;"Tachtatzis, Christos/0000-0001-9150-6805; Atkinson, Robert/0000-0002-6206-2229";;;;;;;;;;;;2043-6386;2043-6394;;;;JUN;2019;9;3;;;;;158;165;;10.1049/iet-wss.2018.5075;;;;;;;WOS:000470905400007;;;;;;

Beyond indispensable IT expertise and essential law knowledge, the consideration of both aspects requires a philosophical awareness of basic notions as subjectivity, responsability, normativity. This topic is therefore dealed according a multidiciplinary and interdisciplinary approach, having recourse to the contribution of a complex system physicist (Samir Suweis), a constitutionalist (Andrea Simoncini), a philosopher of law (Agata Amato Mangiameli) and a philosopher of action (Gabriele De Anna).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2280-482X;;;;;JUN;2019;8;1;;;;;81;85;;10.4477/93367;;;;;;;WOS:000470022200008;;;;;;

Presenting the Compas case, we highlight some critical aspects of the application of AI on judicial decisions. We conclude the work by reflecting on the radical transformations that are proceeding at great speed, underlining the main challenges that only through interdisciplinary approaches can be effectively addressed and proposing some of the fundamental principles of a new constitutional law of the cybernetic era.;;;;Simoncini, Andrea/U-7949-2019;;;;;;;;;;;;;2280-482X;;;;;JUN;2019;8;1;;;;;87;106;;10.4477/93368;;;;;;;WOS:000470022200009;;;;;;

The Rules and Principles of Robotics;RIVISTA DI FILOSOFIA DEL DIRITTO-JOURNAL OF LEGAL PHILOSOPHY;;;;;;;;;;;;Is the activity of software a neutral one? The set of algorithms and big data which help the framework of an artificial intelligence in recognizing, classifying or elaborating data, could be considered truly objective? As a matter of fact, data are never objective: statistical models represent reality as they modify it. Furthermore, we are living in the era of learning machines: robots are everyday more intelligent, useful and independent from human control. As they are implied in a long list of activities, we need to know which rules they have to respect. Most of all, we need to establish who, and in what terms, could be responsible for their faults. That is why the European Union is elaborating a set of principles and rules on Robots and Artificial Intelligence: new technologies have a great potential for the benefit of humanity, provided that ethics and law do not give up on ruling them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2280-482X;;;;;JUN;2019;8;1;;;;;107;124;;10.4477/93369;;;;;;;WOS:000470022200010;;;;;;

Can we trust decisions concerning lives of humans taken by machines following processes that we cannot check or understand? These questions are just some examples of challenges that contemporary AI poses to law theory, since they contest our habitual distinctions between humans and cyborgs, between responsible and non-responsible beings, between determined and free agents. Based on Turing's considerations concerning the nature of an algorithm, this essay supports some claims about personhood and action suggesting that any solution to these problems requires a previous understanding of the notion of the human form of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2280-482X;;;;;JUN;2019;8;1;;;;;125;142;;10.4477/93370;;;;;;;WOS:000470022200011;;;;;;

J;Brodner, P;;;;Broedner, Peter;;;Coping with Descartes' error in information systems;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;Coming from Hubert Dreyfus' recent book Retrieving Realism (together with Charles Taylor), the paper presents embodied pre-conceptual perception and representational cognition as two contrasting perspectives on accessing the world. It further characterises the different forms of knowledge emerging from these perspectives and how they dynamically relate to each other. Taking up the Peircean theory of signs and abductive reasoning as methods of discovery, computers are analysed as semiotic machines that formally model and objectify explicit knowledge about social practices and that can be embedded in the sign processes of thereby restructured practices. This practice theoretical perspective allows for both, understanding the limits of AI and pointing to options for productively combining the performance of cognitive artifacts with the tacit skills of knowledge workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;JUN;2019;34;2;;;SI;;203;213;;10.1007/s00146-018-0798-8;;;;;;;WOS:000469316500004;;;;;;
J;Nadin, M;;;;Nadin, Mihai;;;Machine intelligence: a chimera;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;The notion of computation has changed the world more than any previous expressions of knowledge. However, as know-how in its particular algorithmic embodiment, computation is closed to meaning. Therefore, computer-based data processing can only mimic life's creative aspects, without being creative itself. AI's current record of accomplishments shows that it automates tasks associated with intelligence, without being intelligent itself. Mistaking the abstract (computation) for the concrete (computer) has led to the religion of everything is an output of computationeven the humankind that conceived the computer. The hypostatized role of computers explains the increased dependence on them. The convergence machine called deep learning is only the most recent form through which the deterministic theology of the machine claims more than what it actually is: extremely effective data processing. A proper understanding of complexity, as well as the need to distinguish between the reactive nature of the artificial and the anticipatory nature of the living are suggested as practical responses to the challenges posed by machine theology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;JUN;2019;34;2;;;SI;;215;242;;10.1007/s00146-018-0842-8;;;;;;;WOS:000469316500005;;;;;;

J;Coeckelbergh, M;;;;Coeckelbergh, Mark;;;Skillful coping with and through technologies: Some challenges and avenues for a Dreyfus-inspired philosophy of technology;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;Dreyfus's work is widely known for its critique of artificial intelligence and still stands as an example of how to do excellent philosophical work that is at the same time relevant to contemporary technological and scientific developments. But for philosophers of technology, especially for those sympathetic to using Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Wittgenstein as sources of inspiration, it has much more to offer. This paper outlines Dreyfus's account of skillful coping and critically evaluates its potential for thinking about technology. First, it is argued that his account of skillful coping can be developed into a general view about handling technology which gives due attention to know-how/implicit knowledge and embodiment. Then a number of outstanding challenges are identified that are difficult to cope with if one remains entirely within the world of Dreyfus's writings. They concern (1) questions regarding other conceptualizations of technology and human-technology relations, (2) issues concerning how to conceptualize the social and the relation between skill, meaning, and practices, and (3) the question about the ethical and political implications of his view, including how virtue and skill are related. Acknowledging some known discussions about Dreyfus's work, but also drawing on other material and on the author's previous writings, the paper suggests that to address these challenges and develop the account of skillful coping into a wider scoped, Dreyfus-inspired philosophy of technology, it could take more distance from Heidegger's conceptions of technology and benefit from (more) engagement with work in postphenomenology (Ihde), pragmatism (Dewey), the later Wittgenstein, and virtue ethics.;;;;;Coeckelbergh, Mark/0000-0001-9576-1002;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;JUN;2019;34;2;;;SI;;269;287;;10.1007/s00146-018-0810-3;;;;;;;WOS:000469316500008;;;;;;
J;White, J;;;;White, Jeffrey;;;Dreyfus on the Fringe: information processing, intelligent activity, and the future of thinking machines;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;From his preliminary analysis in 1965, Hubert Dreyfus projected a future much different than those with which his contemporaries were practically concerned, tempering their optimism in realizing something like human intelligence through conventional methods. At that time, he advised that there was nothing directly to be done toward machines with human-like intelligence, and that practical research should aim at a symbiosis between human beings and computers with computers doing what they do best, processing discrete symbols in formally structured problem domains. Fast-forward five decades, and his emphasis on the difference between two essential modes of processing, the unconscious yet purposeful mode fundamental to situated human cognition, and the minded sense of conscious processing characterizing symbolic reasoning that seems to lend itself to explicit programming, continues into the famous Dreyfus-McDowell debate. The present memorial reviews Dreyfus' early projections, asking if the fears that punctuate current popular commentary on AI are warranted, and in light of these if he would deliver similar practical advice to researchers today.;;;;;, Jeffrey/0000-0003-1306-0435;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;JUN;2019;34;2;;;SI;;301;312;;10.1007/s00146-018-0837-5;;;;;;;WOS:000469316500010;;;;;;
J;Kim, MS;;;;Kim, Min-Sun;;;Robot as the mechanical other: transcending karmic dilemma;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;As the artificial intelligence of computers grows ever-more sophisticated and continues to surpass the capacities of human minds in many ways, people are forced to question alleged ontological categories that separate humans from machines. As we are entering the world which is populated by non-enhanced and enhanced humans, cyborgs, robots, androids, avatars, and clones among them, the desire for evolutionary mastery of the natural world has taken on the two main directions: merging with machines in (1) disembodied forms or (2) embodied forms. As a path to breaking past the discontinuity between humans and machines and enter into a world beyond the fourth discontinuity, machines are viewed as an evolutionary step toward the perfection or immortality of humans. However, this popular, instrumental views of machines, stemming from the existential death anxiety and the hope for transcending mortality, reveals the karmic dilemma of desiring or grasping something. We shall discuss the possibility that machines can present, ultimately, a revolutionary step rather than an evolutionary step toward understanding who we are. The path toward a continuity with machines lies not in our desire for merging with the robots, but in recognizing the arbitrary nature of all such identity categories. This radical understanding of the self-identity can be seen as a facet of enlightened experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;JUN;2019;34;2;;;SI;;321;330;;10.1007/s00146-018-0841-9;;;;;;;WOS:000469316500012;;;;;;
J;"Liberati, N; Nagataki, S";;;;"Liberati, Nicola; Nagataki, Shoji";;;Vulnerability under the gaze of robots: relations among humans and robots;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;The problem of artificial intelligence and human being has always raised questions about possible interactions among them and possible effects yielded by the introduction of such un-human subject. Dreyfus deeply connects intelligence and body based on a phenomenological viewpoint. Thanks to his reading of Merleau-Ponty, he clearly stated that an intelligence must be embodied into a body to function. According to his suggestion, any AI designed to be human-like is doom to failure if there is no tight bound with a human-like body. Today, we are facing the pervasive introduction of robots into our everyday life, and the problem of this co-existence raises again with new vigor since they are not mere speculations, but there are already products sold to the public. We will highlight how vulnerability has to be taken into consideration in the design of robots to create entities which are able to relate to human beings taking into consideration mainly the positions of Sartre, Habermas, Levinas, and Marleau-Ponty. A first part will focus on the vulnerability of the robots. Robots are going to be among us, but a real interaction is possible only the moment they have a same body of ours. Therefore, only through the realization of a fragile body we can achieve a cohabitation between equals. Thanks to Merleau-Ponty we will show how the vulnerability of a body is one of the most important element to found any social interaction. The second part will focus on how the robots will affect the vulnerability of the human subjects. To produce vulnerable robots is not a mere neutral introduction, but it shapes how the subjects are constituted. Thanks to Levinas, we will study how the vulnerable robots will shape the subjects. Thanks to Sartre, we will show how the creation of a different gaze in the robot changes the vulnerabilities of the human subjects. Introducing vulnerable robots is a way to shape ourselves.;;;;;Liberati, Nicola/0000-0001-8476-3600;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;JUN;2019;34;2;;;SI;;333;342;;10.1007/s00146-018-0849-1;;;;;;;WOS:000469316500014;;;;;;
J;"van der Meulen, S; Bruinsma, M";;;;"van der Meulen, Sjoukje; Bruinsma, Max";;;Man as aggregate of data': What computers shouldn't do;AI & SOCIETY;;;;;;;;;;;;Since the emergence of the innovative field of artificial intelligence (AI) in the 1960s, the late Hubert Dreyfus insisted on the ontological distinction between man and machine, human and artificial intelligence. In the different editions of his classic and influential book What computers can't do (1972), he posits that an algorithmic machine can never fully simulate the complex functioning of the human mindnot now, nor in the future. Dreyfus' categorical distinctions between man and machine are still relevant today, but their relation has become more complex in our increasingly data-driven society. We, humans, are continuously immersed within a technological universe, while at the same time ubiquitous computing, in the words of computer scientist Mark Weiser, forces computers to live out here in the world with people (De Souza e Silva in Interfaces of hybrid spaces. In: Kavoori AP, Arceneaux N (eds) The cell phone reader. Peter Lang Publishing, New York, 2006, p20). Dreyfus' ideas are therefore challenged by thinkers such as Weiser, Kevin Kelly, Bruno Latour, Philip Agre, and Peter Paul Verbeek, who all argue that humans are much more intrinsically linked to machines than the original dichotomy suggeststhey have evolved in concert. Through a discussion of the classical concepts of individuum and authenticity' within Western civilization, this paper argues that within the ever-expanding data-sphere of the twenty-first century, a new concept of man as aggregate of data' has emerged, which further erodes and undermines the categorical distinction between man and machine. This raises political and ethical questions beyond the confines of technology and artificial intelligence. Moreover, this seemingly never-ending debate on what computers should (or should not) do provokes the philosophical necessity to once again define the concept of what it is to be human.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;JUN;2019;34;2;;;SI;;343;354;;10.1007/s00146-018-0852-6;;;;;;;WOS:000469316500015;;;;;;

However, the predicted timeline of this process is uncertain. To avoid any kind of speculations on the proposed analysis from a scientific point of view, a metaphysical approach is undertaken as a modal context of the discussion. I argue that modal claim about possible AI emergence at a certain point of time in the future is justified from a temporal perspective. Therefore, worldwide society must be prepared for possible AI emergence and the expected profound impact of such an event on the existential status of humanity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0951-5666;1435-5655;;;;JUN;2019;34;2;;;SI;;365;371;;10.1007/s00146-018-0833-9;;;;;;;WOS:000469316500017;;;;;;

Lower fertility and increasing longevity have implications on the age population structure and, therefore, on the balance between savings and investment. Jointly with meagre productivity growth, this implies a low natural rate of interest that conditions the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies, especially in a world of high debt. New technological changes (robots, artificial intelligence, automation) may increase productivity growth but at the risk of having disruptive effects on employment and wages.

Many, if not most, of these bioinspirations carry with them some common issues and features which happen at the individual level, promoting very similar collective emergent phenomena. Thus, despite using different biological metaphors as inspiration, most algorithms present a similar structure and it is possible to identify common macro-processes among them. In this context, this paper identifies a set of common features among some well-known swarm-based algorithms and how each of these approaches implement them. By doing this, we provide the community with the core features of swarm-intelligence algorithms.

Situated in the border of evolutionary systems and bioinformatics, the computational model of P system is an evolved algorithm based upon the structure and evolution rules of biological living cells to outperform some conventional systems. Thus, this paper presents a version of multi-compartmental Gillespie algorithm used to simulate the parallelism of chemical reactions in the quorum sensing phenomena of a bacteria colony. This model is used to distribute the computation over the membranes. The aim is to achieve scalability and get mapping the communication between bacteria and their environment. The obtained results prove that this process adds an important value to the multi-compartmental Gillespie algorithm, which uses the organizational aspect of the membrane structure. They also prove that the independent parallel evolution of the membranes is basic to improve legitimacy of the strategy which leads to a reliable simulation and gives a more realistic representation of the system's evolution.;;;;Ali, Yamina Mohamed Ben/O-3612-2016;Ali, Yamina Mohamed Ben/0000-0002-5001-4799;;;;;;;;;;;;1868-6478;1868-6486;;;;JUN;2019;10;2;;;;;167;177;;10.1007/s12530-018-9226-z;;;;;;;WOS:000468241600006;;;;;;

J;"Ernst, E; Merola, R; Samaan, D";;;;"Ernst, Ekkehardt; Merola, Rossana; Samaan, Daniel";;;Economics of Artificial Intelligence: Implications for the Future of Work;IZA JOURNAL OF LABOR POLICY;;;;;;;;;;;;The current wave of technological change based on advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) has created widespread fear of job loss and further rises in inequality. This paper discusses the rationale for these fears, highlighting the specific nature of AI and comparing previous waves of automation and robotization with the current advancements made possible by a widespread adoption of AI. It argues that large opportunities in terms of increases in productivity can ensue, including for developing countries, given the vastly reduced costs of capital that some applications have demonstrated and the potential for productivity increases, especially among the low skilled. At the same time, risks in the form of further increases in inequality need to be addressed if the benefits from AI-based technological progress are to be broadly shared. For this, skills policies are necessary but not sufficient. In addition, new forms of regulating the digital economy are called for that prevent further rises in market concentration, ensure proper data protection and privacy, and help share the benefits of productivity growth through the combination of profit sharing, (digital) capital taxation, and a reduction in working time. The paper calls for a moderately optimistic outlook on the opportunities and risks from AI, provided that policymakers and social partners take the particular characteristics of these new technologies into account.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2193-9004;;;;;JUN;2019;9;1;;;;;;;4;10.2478/izajolp-2019-0004;;;;;;;WOS:000591878100004;;;;;;

Based on this trend, a path planning methodology for autonomous bulldozers is proposed and developed. This methodology autonomously plans an efficient path depending on a given terrain specification. Conventional existing path planning algorithms are designed versatilely, typically by using a grid-based map. However, in reality, a substantial effort is still required when applying to specific industry products. In contrast to this trend, the aim of this work is to develop a path planning algorithm specifically suitable for our bulldozers, from the theory development phase. The novel path planning methodology was developed by incorporating industry feedback, and has successfully resolved the issues which occurred when attempting to apply the existing planning methodologies. This paper also demonstrates that, compared to experienced manual operation, the developed methodology performs equally in simple terrains, and outperforms in complex terrain. An optimization with many different factors involved is also presented to theoretically show the efficient operation.;;;;Katupitiya, Jayantha/AAF-1937-2019;"Whitty, Mark/0000-0002-3860-9458; Katupitiya, Jay/0000-0003-2683-4532";;;;;;;;;;;;1349-4198;1349-418X;;;;JUN;2019;15;3;;;;;825;844;;10.24507/ijicic.15.03.825;;;;;;;WOS:000466788900002;;;;;;

J;Mahfoudhi, S;;;;Mahfoudhi, Sami;;;Enhancing Cloud of Things performance through Intrusion Detection via machine learning;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY;;;;;;;;;;;;Recently, Internet of things (IoT) has become one of the hot topics of research. Things are, in most cases, deployed in unmonitored fields. So, ensuring the reliability of collected data is becoming a challenging issue. One of the most common problem affecting IoT is caused by intrusion, which could alter, delete or modify data collected by things. It could affect the whole functionality of IoT by causing faulty situations like taking wrong decisions. On one hand, the intrusion is among the hardest attack that could to be detected. On the other, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are powerful and emerging techniques that could be used to achieve this purpose. In this paper, we propose to use classification techniques to deal with the problem of intrusion detection. More precisely, we applied a set of classification tools on a real IoT dataset to detect intrusion. The comparison of classification results is shown through an experimental study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1738-7906;;;;;MAY 30;2019;19;5;;;;;123;127;;;;;;;;;WOS:000473699100018;;;;;;

C.";;;A Deep Learning-Based Decision Support Tool for Precision Risk Assessment of Breast Cancer;JCO CLINICAL CANCER INFORMATICS;;;;;;;;;;;;PURPOSE The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon was developed to standardize mammographic reporting to assess cancer risk and facilitate the decision to biopsy. Because of substantial interobserver variability in the application of the BI-RADS lexicon, the decision to biopsy varies greatly and results in overdiagnosis and excessive biopsies. The false-positive rate from mammograms is estimated to be 7% to approximately 10% overall, but within the BI-RADS 4 category, it is greater than 70%. Therefore, we developed the Breast Cancer Risk Calculator (BRISK) to target a well-characterized and specific patient subgroup (BI-RADS 4) rather than a broad heterogeneous group in assessing breast cancer risk. METHODS BRISK provides a novel precise risk assessment model to reduce overdiagnosis and unnecessary biopsies. It was developed by applying natural language processing and deep learning methods on 5,147 patient records archived in the Houston Methodist systemwide data warehouse from 2006 to May 2015, including imaging and pathology reports, mammographic images, and patient demographics. Key characteristics for BI-RADS 4 patients were collected and computed to output an index measure for biopsy recommendation that is clinically relevant and informative and improves upon the traditional BI-RADS 4 scores. RESULTS For the validation set, we assessed data from 1,247 BI-RADS 4 patients, including mammographic images and medical reports. The BRISK model sensitivity to predict malignancy was 100%, whereas the specificity was 74%. The total accuracy of our implemented model in BRISK was 81%. Overall area under the curve was 0.93. CONCLUSION BRISK for abnormal mammogram uses integrative artificial intelligence technology and has demonstrated high sensitivity in the prediction of malignancy. Prospective evaluation is under way and can lead to improvement in patient-physician engagement in making informed decisions with regard to biopsy.

These unprecedented quantities of data combine with high-performance computers to produce a series of increasingly powerful tools ranging from mathematical modeling on a massive scale to various types of artificial intelligence. Within this context, urban planning and design driven by data and predictive tools have been gaining traction. This scientific approach to urban problems echoes the nineteenth-century birth of modern urbanism, when rapid industrialization and new scientific methods were advocated against a traditional beaux-arts approach to city planning; and the twentieth century proved that such scientific methods were politically charged. Arguing that we are facing a similar breakthrough in urban studies and planning, in this paper we discuss how data-driven approaches can foster urban studies, but must be balanced with a critical view to the inherent social values of cities.";;;;;Duarte, Fabio/0000-0003-0909-5379;;;;;;;;;;;;2055-1045;;;;;MAY 28;2019;5;;;;;;;;54;10.1057/s41599-019-0264-3;;;;;;;WOS:000472956200001;;;;;;

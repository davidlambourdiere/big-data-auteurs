J;Bojic, N;;;;Bojic, Nikola;;;Social and Physical Planning: Two Approaches to Territorial Production in Socialist Yugoslavia between 1955 and 1963;ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIES;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"GEOGRAPHY; SPACE";By introducing workers' self-management in the 1950s, socialist Yugoslavia aimed to decentralize socioeconomic planning and gradually translate into practice the Marxist-Leninist theory of the 'withering away of the State'. Although the new planning model was intended to provide a more balanced distribution of economic opportunities across the socially diverse federal territory, in practice it prioritized exponential economic growth, contributing to a rural exodus and hyper-concentration of workforce, management capacities and resources in the urban agglomerations. As a direct response to the severe consequences of post-war urbanisation in Yugoslavia, experts from the Urban Planning Institute of Croatia developed the first Yugoslavian methodology of regional planning. With a reference to Hilberseimer's theoretical work on regional planning, the methodology aimed to integrate rural and urban areas into a coherent regional space with a greater degree of socio-economic independence from the urban centres. This paper provides a critical overview of social and regional planning in Yugoslavia between the introduction of the communal system in 1955 and the new constitution in 1963. By following the two parallel yet interwoven planning discourses, the paper analyses the transition of the State ideology and political economy into the spatial realm. The comparison of two discourses reveals the ambiguous relationship between social and regional planning and the strategic attempts of urban planners to negotiate their ideological positions within the evolving political system. The regional plan for the Krapina district is the first manifestation of the new planning methodology, which intended to reconcile contradictions between city and countryside, centre and periphery, centralisation and decentralisation.;[Bojic, Nikola] Inst Art Hist, Zagreb, Croatia;Bojic, N (corresponding author), Inst Art Hist, Zagreb, Croatia.;nbojic@ipu.hr;;;;;;63;3;3;0;3;UBIQUITY PRESS LTD;LONDON;2N, 6 OSBORNE ST, LONDON, E1 6TD, ENGLAND;2050-5833;;;ARCHIT HIST-LONDON;Archit.

In addition to experimental repeatability, limiting the (pre-) analytical variance is also essential. To address this problem in the field of metabolomics, we have designed KIMBLE, the KNIME-based Integrated MetaB-oLomics Environment, a novel platform for the processing and analysis of NMR metabolomics data. It consists of an elaborate NMR metabolomics workflow in the KNIME workflow management system that handles both targeted and untargeted metabolomics. The workflow provides a self-documenting way of transforming raw time-domain NMR data into metabolic insights. Parameters for the quantification of a number of interesting metabolites in urine are included in the workflow, and several useful statistical analysis and visualization tools are incorporated as well. The workflow comes with an interesting sports-induced ketosis dataset so that new users can easily get acquainted with the platform. The user is free to adapt and extend the workflow to his or her personal needs. The KIMBLE workflow, the KNIME software and all the required libraries are installed in a VirtualBox virtual machine that allows for facile installation and use by non-experts. (C) 2018 The Authors.

One third of the global population are infected with the TB bacterium, and the prevailing diagnosis methods are either resource-intensive or time consuming. Thus, a reliable and easy-to-use diagnosis system has become essential to make the world TB free by 2030, as envisioned by the World Health Organisation. In this work, the challenges in implementing an efficient image processing platform is presented to extract the images from plasmonic ELISAs for TB antigen-specific antibodies and analyse their features. The supervised machine learning techniques are utilised to attain binary classification from eighteen lower-order colour moments. The proposed system is trained off-line, followed by testing and validation using a separate set of images in real-time. Using an ensemble classifier, Random Forest, we demonstrated 98.4% accuracy in TB antigen-specific antibody detection on the mobile platform. Unlike the existing systems, the proposed intelligent system with real time processing capabilities and data portability can provide the prediction without any opto-mechanical attachment, which will undergo a clinical test in the next phase.

Building upon this further, community structure can be measured through a clustering coefficient, which is generated from the number of existing triangles around the nodes over the number of triangles that can be hypothetically constructed. This paper provides a new definition of the clustering coefficient for weighted networks under a generalized definition of triangles. Specifically, a novel concept of triangles is introduced, based on the assumption that, should the aggregate weight of two arcs be strong enough, a link between the uncommon nodes can be induced. Beyond the intuitive meaning of such generalized triangles in the social context, we also explore the usefulness of them for gaining insights into the topological structure of the underlying network. Empirical experiments on the standard networks of 500 commercial US airports and on the nervous system of the Caenorhabditis elegans support the theoretical framework and allow a comparison between our proposal and the standard definition of clustering coefficient.

From a human perspective, this problem is solved by means of cognitive mechanisms related to attention. In particular, saliency is a property of particular stimuli that makes them stand from others to allow the brain to take decisions about their relevance in the process of exploring the world. For artificial intelligence systems it is advantageous to mimic these mechanisms. Visual saliency algorithms have been successfully employed in tasks such as medical diagnosis, detection of violent scenes, environment understanding made by robots, etc. In contrast, computational models of the acoustic saliency mechanisms are less extended. In this context, we propose a novel acoustic saliency algorithm to be used by intelligent and expert systems facing tasks such as sound detection and classification, early alarm, surveillance, robotic exploration of the surroundings, among many other applications. This technique, we termed echoic log-surprise, combines an unsupervised statistical approach based on Bayesian log-surprise and the biological concept of echoic or Auditory Sensory Memory. Our algorithm computes several independent log-surprise cues in parallel considering a wide range of memory values, with the aim of leveraging saliency information from different temporal scales. Then, we explore several statistical metrics to combine these multi-scale signals in a single temporal saliency signal including Renyi entropy, Jensen-Shannon divergence, Cramer or Bhattacharyya distances. We have adopted Acoustic Event Detection tasks as adequate proxies to test its performance. Results show that the proposed echoic log-surprise method outperforms classical acoustic detection techniques commonly deployed in intelligent and expert systems, such as energy thresholding or voice activity detection, and it also achieves better results than some other state-of-the-art acoustic saliency algorithms, such as Kalinli's and conventional log-surprise.

Expert systems are gaining much attention in the medical image analysis field for the clinical treatment and follow up study. Traditional sparse representation based classifiers use a random subset in a limited range. It suffers from the problem of repetition of the training samples which may prevent obtaining optimal subset having all variations. To overcome this problem, nested cross-validation based adaptive sparse representation algorithm is newly proposed. The novelty of the work are: (i) a novel strategy for optimal subset selection, (ii) adaptively selects an optimal subset, (iii) ability to overcome the problems like overfitting, underfitting and bias results, (iv) better accuracy in all variations of training samples, and (v) newly applied to pathological brain classification problem. The proposed system is based on a hybrid methodology of feature selection followed by classification. The gray level co-occurrence matrix is used to extract the spatial texture feature vectors of the brain MRI samples. The nested cross-validation based adaptive sparse representation algorithm is used for classification. It uses a nested cross-validation technique to obtain the optimal value of the subset size (N) based on maximum classification accuracy. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional approaches from literature do not satisfy medical experts since they do not reflect the cognitive process they perform when scoring polysomnographic curves. We propose a new approach that is based on the implementation of medical knowledge by symbolic fusion. Medical knowledge coming from the international clinical practice guidelines for sleep medicine is formalized as a five-layer framework dedicated to data abstraction in order to deliver local and global propositions and support the interpretation of polysomnographic curves. Firstly, features are extracted from raw curves. Then these features are combined to recognize sleep events in accordance with guidelines. Sleep events are then fused into the criteria required to recognize the different sleep stages. Sleep is not homogeneous through the night. The physiological events observed during the night follow a dynamic that needs to be included into an automatic sleep staging system. In order to take this into account, decision rules are selected and applied to recognize a sleep stage according to the current context. Thereby, transitions are considered with interest. In this paper, we propose to use a Turing Machine-like decision process to handle transitions. To interpret the local observations and properly score a given state, the previous state which has been stored in a specific register is used as a context. One of the advantages of following the principles of symbolic fusion is to benefit from the full traceability of the decision. Hence, it makes possible to discuss each final - or intermediate - decision with an expert and check for relevance. The preliminary results are encouraging since agreement rates provided between decisions taken by our automatic approach and human experts are similar to those measured between human experts (average agreement rate = 54.60% / average Cohen's kappa = 0.40) on a dataset of 131 full polysomnographic recordings.

A prerequisite for realization of a robotic fruit picker is its ability to detect fruits in tree tops. An expert system, which would be able to compete with human perception, must be capable of recognizing fruits among leaves and branches under uncontrolled conditions, where fruits are occluded and shaded. In this paper, a novel approach for fruit recognition in RGB-D images based on detection and classification of convex surfaces is proposed. The input RGB-D image is first segmented into convex surfaces by a region growing procedure. Each convex surface is then described by an appropriate descriptor and classified with the aid of the associated descriptor. A novel descriptor of approximately convex surfaces is proposed, which we named Convex Template Instance (CTI) descriptor. It is based on approximating surfaces by convex polyhedrons with quantized face orientations, where every polyhedron face corresponds to one descriptor component. Computation of the proposed descriptor is simple and can be performed very efficiently. The proposed CTI descriptor is compared to the SHOT descriptor, a standard descriptor for 3D point clouds. Two variants of the both CTI and SHOT descriptor are evaluated, a variant which uses color and a variant which does not. A k-nearest neighbor classifier is used to classify detected surfaces into two classes: fruit and other. The main advantage of the proposed expert system in comparison to other fruit recognition solutions is its computational efficiency, which is of great importance for its target application - an automatic fruit picker. The proposed approach is evaluated using a challenging dataset containing RGB-D images of four fruit sorts acquired under uncontrolled conditions, which has been made publicly available to the scientific community, allowing benchmarking of novel fruit recognition methods.

In order to comply with those measures and to have a better environmental image, companies are investing heavily in environmental, social and economic responsibility issues. Moreover, they continuously track the environmental performance of their suppliers. Many green supplier evaluation and ranking methodologies were proposed in the literature in order to assist companies in the environmental performance evaluation of suppliers. However, the number of studies on the sorting of suppliers based on environmental criteria is very limited. In this study, we fill this research gap by proposing a novel VIKOR-based green supplier sorting methodology called VIKORSORT.

Three popular fuzzy mathematical programming approaches, including maxmin, arithmetical average, and two-phase methods, are often employed to solve MOLP problems. However, maxmin and two-phase methods cannot obtain an efficient solution. Ideal and anti-ideal solutions are required in all traditional methods. Such solutions cannot easily be established as a model for a knowledge-based system or expert system. In order to enrich the body of knowledge related to the field of MOLP, a new multi-choice goal programming (MCGP) model is proposed to solve fuzzy MOLP (FMOLP) problems in which the ideal and anti-ideal solutions are no longer required. This reduces the complexity of the solution process for solving MODM. The original feasible region can be expended to a potential feasible region to determine the appropriate aspiration level for decision makers. The proposed methods can systematically solve MODM problem to obtain satisfactory solutions in one step. Thus, a model-based can easily be established for expert systems, knowledge-based system, and artificial intelligence systems. In addition, a revised utility function (UF) is derived to solve qualitative and quantitative MODM problems. Based on illustrative examples, the five methods (maxmin, arithmetical average, two-phase, goal programming (GP), and proposed models) are compared to reveal managerial implications. On the basis of these comparisons, DMs can easily determine the best suited solution for their specific MODM problems. Finally, a realistic example is provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of the intricate nature of cellular membranes, a plethora of in vitro studies have been carried out with model membrane systems that capture particular properties such as fluidity, permeability, and protein binding but vastly simplify the membrane composition in order to focus in detail on a specialized property or function. Supported lipid bilayers (SLB) are widely used as archetypes for cellular membranes, and this instructional review primarily focuses on the preparation and characterization of SLB systems formed by Langmuir deposition methods. Typical characterization methods, which take advantage of the planar orientation of SLBs, are illustrated, and references that go into more depth are included. This invited instructional review is written so that nonexperts can quickly gain in-depth knowledge regarding the preparation and characterization of SLBs. In addition, this work goes beyond traditional instructional reviews to provide expert readers with new results that cover a wider range of SLB systems than those previously reported in the literature. The quality of an SLB is frequently not well described, and details such as topological defects can influence the results and conclusions of an individual study.

Objective: The objective of this study was to combine principles in nanotechnology, TB biology, glycochemistry, and engineering, for the development of a nanoparticle-based colorimetric biosensing assay (NCBA) to quickly and inexpensively detect acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in sputum samples. Methods: In NCBA, the isolation of AFB from sputum samples was accomplished through glycan-coated magnetic nanoparticles (GMNP) interacting with AFB and then using a simple magnet to separate the GMNP-AFB complex. Acid-fastness and cording properties of mycobacteria were utilized to provide visually observable red-stained clumps of bacteria that were surrounded by brown nanoparticles under a light microscope on prepared smears. The NCBA technique was compared against sputum smear microscopy (SSM) and Xpert MTB/RIF in 500 samples from patients that were suspected to have TB. Results: Statistical analysis showed that NCBA had sensitivity and specificity performances in perfect agreement with Xpert MTB/RIF as gold standard for all 500 samples. SSM had a sensitivity of 40% for the same samples. Conclusion: NCBA technique yielded full agreement in terms of sensitivity and specificity with the Xpert MTB/RIF in 500 samples. The method is completed in 10-20 min through a simple process at an estimated cost of $0.10 per test. Implementation of NCBA in rural communities would help to increase case finding and case notification, and would support programs against drug-resistance. Its use at the first point-of-contact by patients in the healthcare system would facilitate quick treatment in a single clinical encounter, thus supporting the global End TB Strategy by 2035.;"[Bhusal, Nirajan; Shrestha, Sunaina; Pote, Nisha] Kathmandu Univ, Dhulikhel Hosp, Dhulikhel 45200, Kavrepalanchok, Nepal; [Bhusal, Nirajan; Alocilja, Evangelyn C.] Michigan State Univ, Global Alliance Rapid Diagnost, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Alocilja, Evangelyn C.] Michigan State Univ, Nanobiosensors Lab, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA";"Alocilja, EC (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Global Alliance Rapid Diagnost, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.; Alocilja, EC (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Nanobiosensors Lab, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.";"nirajanbhusal@gmail.com; stha.sunaina@gmail.com; potenisha@gmail.com; alocilja@msu.edu";;Bhusal, Nirajan/0000-0001-6926-0634;"Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering at MSU; Department of Animal Science at MSU; Asian Studies Center at MSU";This project is a collaboration between Kathmandu University Dhulikhel Hospital, Nepal and Michigan State University, USA.

An index system of highway traffic safety influencing factors for cold regions is developed, and an evaluation model for traffic road safety influencing factors in cold regions based on attribute recognition theory is proposed. The weight of the model is determined using an analytic hierarchy process combined with expert scoring. The evaluation model is based on single-index attribute measure values and multi-index comprehensive attribute measurement values, using the confidence criterion to identify the influence of road traffic safety factors on road traffic safety in cold regions. In addition, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is used for comparative evaluation, and the evaluation results were consistent and verified the correctness and feasibility of the attribute recognition model.

We used five measures to compare the results in a cohort of children followed up for between 3.5 to 5years.MethodsIn January 2017 two experienced physiotherapists assessed children who had started treatment between 2011 and 2013 in one clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe. The length of time in treatment was documented. The Roye score, Bangla clubfoot assessment tool, the Assessing Clubfoot Treatment (ACT) tool, proportion of relapsed and of plantigrade feet were used to assess the outcome of treatment in the cohort. Inter-observer variation was calculated for the two physiotherapists. A comparative analysis of the entire cohort, the children who had completed casting and the children who completed more than two years of bracing was undertaken. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated for the five measures and compared to full clinical assessment (gold standard) and whether referral for further intervention was required for re-casting or surgical review.Results31% (68/218) of the cohort attended for examination and were assessed. Of the children who were assessed, 24 (35%) had attended clinic reviews for 4-5years, and 30 (44%) for less than 2years. There was good inter-observer agreement between the two expert physiotherapists on all assessment tools. Overall success of treatment varied between 56 and 93% using the different outcome measures. The relapse assessment had the highest unnecessary referrals (19.1%), and the Roye score the highest proportion of missed referrals (22.7%). The ACT and Bangla score missed the fewest number of referrals (7.4%). The Bangla score demonstrated 79.2% (95%CI: 57.8-92.9%) sensitivity and 79.5% (95%CI: 64.7-90.2%) specificity and the ACT score had 79.2% (95%CI: 57.8-92.9%) sensitivity and 100% (95%CI: 92-100%) specificity in predicting the need for referral.ConclusionAt three to five years of follow up, the Ponseti method has a good success rate that improves if the child has completed casting and at least two years of bracing. The ACT score demonstrates good diagnostic accuracy for the need for referral for further intervention (specialist opinion or further casting).

A lava field formed in one of the most remote areas in Iceland, after the propagation of a similar to 50 km-long dyke beneath the Vatnajokullice cap, where the Bargarbunga caldera is located. Due to the 6 month duration of the eruption, mainly in wintertime, daily monitoring was particularly challenging. During the eruption, the European volcanological project FutureVolc was ongoing, allowing collaboration of many European experts on volcano monitoring activities. Icelandic volcanoes are also a permanent Supersite within the Geohazard Supersites and Natural Laboratories (GSNL) initiative, with support from the Committee on Earth Observation Satellite (CEOS) in the form of a large collection of SAR images. SAR data were acquired by Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellites and complemented by aerial SAR images. The large set of SAR satellite data significantly contributed to the daily monitoring during the unrest at Bargarbunga caldera, the Holuhraun eruption and the year following the eruption. Detection of surface changes using both SAR amplitude and phase information was conducted throughout the whole duration of the volcano-tectonic event, and in the following months, to quantify and track the evolution of volcanic processes at Holuhraun and geothermal activity at Bargarbunga volcano. Combination of SAR data with other data sets, e.g., satellite optical images and geodetic Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements, was essential for the evaluation of the volcanic hazard in the whole area. International collaboration within the FutureVolc project formed the basis for successful analyses and interpretation of the large SAR data set.

Due to differences in farming typologies and data availability between nations, a common methodology for identifying HNVf docs not exist, nor is considered appropriate. In the current study we use the Mediterranean island of Cyprus as a case study to highlight EU-wide issues for the identification and mapping of HNVf. We brought together under a common spatial framework datasets on farming typology, agro-chemical inputs, water use intensity and biodiversity data collected from public authorities and nature/biodiversity conservation organisations. Using an expert driven approach informed by a range of stakeholders, we identified and mapped potential HNVf areas employing a 1 km(2) mapping grid as the reporting spatial framework under two storylines for defining farmland area within every grid cell: a liberal with 10% threshold and a conservative with 25% threshold. Areas containing potentially HNVf may extend from 22.5-34.5% of the island, depending on the storyline employed. HNVf Type I is the more restricted type for both storylines, while Type II is the most extensive. The highest over-lap was between Type II and Type III for the liberal storyline and between Type I and II for the conservative storyline. HNVfs cover an area between 30 to 57% of the Natura2000 network on the island depending on the storyline. With the liberal storyline for farmland definition, the spatial extent of HNVfs together with the existing Natura2000 sites cover 90% of the study area, while with the conservative storyline this figure drops to ca.75% The results confirm the role of HNVfs within and around Natura2000 sites in Cyprus and their potential for providing connection and site buffering opportunities, particularly in the lowlands, while they can provide information about policy-making for agri-environmental payments targeting.;"[Zomeni, Maria; Vogiatzakis, Ioannis N.] Open Univ Cyprus, Sch Pure & Appl Sci, Latsia, Cyprus; [Martinou, Angeliki F.; Stavrinides, Menelaos C.] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Agr Sci, Limassol, Cyprus";Vogiatzakis, IN (corresponding author), Open Univ Cyprus, Sch Pure & Appl Sci, Latsia, Cyprus.;ioannis.vogiatzakis@ouc.ac.cy;"Vogiatzakis, Ioannis N./J-6986-2013; BITOUN, RACHEL/AAC-9538-2021; Martinou, Kelly/AAN-5691-2020";"Vogiatzakis, Ioannis N./0000-0001-7071-6950; Martinou, Kelly/0000-0003-2892-8583; Stavrinides, Menelaos/0000-0002-6459-1941";"Department of Environment (MANRE); AgroLIFE: To promote and enable the conservation of High Nature Value Farmlands in Cyprus.

The assessment of climatic hazard risk to cities rarely has captured the multiple interactions that occur in complex urban systems. We present an improved method for urban multi-hazard risk assessment. We then analyze the risk of New York City as a case study to apply enhanced methods for multi-hazard risk assessment given the history of exposure to multiple types of natural hazards which overlap spatially and, in some cases, temporally in this coastal megacity. Our aim is to identify hotspots of multi-hazard risk to support the prioritization of adaptation strategies that can address multiple sources of risk to urban residents. We used socioeconomic indicators to assess vulnerabilities and risks to three climate-related hazards (i.e., heat waves, inland flooding and coastal flooding) at high spatial resolution. The analysis incorporates local experts' opinions to identify sources of multi-hazard risk and to weight indicators used in the multi-hazard risk assessment. Results demonstrate the application of multi-hazard risk assessment to a coastal megacity and show that spatial hotspots of multi-hazard risk affect similar local residential communities along the coastlines. Analyses suggest that New York City should prioritize adaptation in coastal zones and consider possible synergies and/or trade-offs to maximize impacts of adaptation and resilience interventions in the spatially overlapping areas at risk of impacts from multiple hazards.;"[Depietri, Yaella; Dahal, Khila; McPhearson, Timon] New Sch, Urban Syst Lab, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Depietri, Yaella] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Haifa, Israel; [Dahal, Khila] Temple Univ, Dept Geog & Urban Studies, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [McPhearson, Timon] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; [McPhearson, Timon] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden";"McPhearson, T (corresponding author), New Sch, Urban Syst Lab, New York, NY 10011 USA.; McPhearson, T (corresponding author), Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA.; McPhearson, T (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden.";timon.mcphearson@su.se;;Depietri, Yaella/0000-0002-0204-3544;"Urban Resilience to Extreme WeatherRelated Events Sustainability Research Network (URExSRN; NSF) [SES 1444755]; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences, and Spatial PlanningSwedish Research Council Formas; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency; German Aeronautics And Space Research Centre; National Science Centre (Poland); Research Council of NorwayResearch Council of Norway; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; Zeff Fellowship at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology";"We thank Jaskirat Randhawa for data visualization assistance, Bill Solecki and Erin Friedman for feedback and local experts for input on weightings.

J;Twisk, F;;;;Twisk, Frank;;;Myalgic Encephalomyelitis or What? The International Consensus Criteria;DIAGNOSTICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"myalgic encephalomyelitis; chronic fatigue syndrome; diagnosis; symptoms; muscles; neurology";CHRONIC-FATIGUE-SYNDROME;"Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) is a neuromuscular disease with two distinctive types of symptoms (muscle fatigability or prolonged muscle weakness after minor exertion and symptoms related to neurological disturbance, especially of sensory, cognitive, and autonomic functions) and variable involvement of other bodily systems. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), introduced in 1988 and re-specified in 1994, is defined as (unexplained) chronic fatigue accompanied by at least four out of eight listed (ill-defined) symptoms. Although ME and CFS are two distinct clinical entities (with partial overlap), CFS overshadowed ME for decades. In 2011, a panel of experts recommended abandoning the label CFS and its definition and proposed a new definition of ME: the International Consensus Criteria for ME (ME-ICC). In addition to post-exertional neuroimmune exhaustion (PENE), a mandatory feature, a patient must experience at least three symptoms related to neurological impairments; at least three symptoms related to immune, gastro-intestinal, and genitourinary impairments; and at least one symptom related to energy production or transportation impairments to meet the diagnosis of ME-ICC. A comparison between the original definition of ME and the ME-ICC shows that there are some crucial differences between ME and ME-ICC. Muscle fatigability, or long-lasting post-exertional muscle weakness, is the hallmark feature of ME, while this symptom is facultative for the diagnosis under the ME-ICC. PENE, an abstract notion that is very different from post-exertional muscle weakness, is the hallmark feature of the ME-ICC but is not required for the diagnosis of ME. The diagnosis of ME requires only two type of symptoms (post-exertional muscle weakness and neurological dysfunction), but a patient has to experience at least eight symptoms to meet the diagnosis according to the ME-ICC. Autonomic, sensory, and cognitive dysfunction, mandatory for the diagnosis of ME, are not compulsory to meet the ME-ICC subcriteria for 'neurological impairments'. In conclusion, the diagnostic criteria for ME and of the ME-ICC define two different patient groups. Thus, the definitions of ME and ME-ICC are not interchangeable.";[Twisk, Frank] ME de Patienten Fdn, Zonnedauw 15, NL-1906 HB Limmen, Netherlands;Twisk, F (corresponding author), ME de Patienten Fdn, Zonnedauw 15, NL-1906 HB Limmen, Netherlands.;frank.twisk@hetnet.nl;;Twisk, Frank/0000-0002-2912-3245;;;;26;2;2;0;1;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2075-4418;;;DIAGNOSTICS;Diagnostics;DEC 20;2018;9;1;;;;;;;1;10.3390/diagnostics9010001;;;7;Medicine, General & Internal;General & Internal Medicine;HS9XV;WOS:000464220900001;30577429;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-02-18;

Methods: We used a descriptive, cross-sectional study design to survey senior clinicians (greater than 10 years practice in this field) caring for patients with acute TSCI. The assessment, management and referral practices of prehospital, emergency department/trauma and surgical expert clinicians, across prehospital, early hospital care, diagnostic imaging and haemodynamic management were surveyed. Results: We invited 95 eligible senior clinicians; the response rate was 75%. Survey findings demonstrated overall lack of awareness or consistent use of evidence based published guidelines; many clinicians following 'locally written' or 'no particular' guideline. Practitioners were conflicted across multiple areas including patient assessment and diagnosis, treatment and transport decisions. Reported spinal immobilisation practices differed substantially, as did target setting for blood pressure; the majority of clinicians actively monitored risk of respiratory deterioration. Specialist care consult and specialist service bed availability was reported as problematic by more than one third of clinicians. Conclusions: Unwarranted clinical practice variation is known to contribute to different health outcomes for patients with similar etiologies. Clinical practice guidelines offer evidence based, best practice standards, however are only effective if adopted throughout the healthcare system. Wide variability in acute care practices, pathways and timing to specialist centres for TSCI was evidenced by this survey despite seniority among clinicians. This devastating injury requires prompt, consistent, evidence based care from the moment of first responder. Improved outcomes for patients with TSCI would be more likely with standardised care across pre-hospital, emergency and acute care phases of care.";"[Sharwood, Lisa N.; Dhaliwal, Shelly; Middleton, James] Univ Sydney, Kolling Inst, Sydney Med Sch, John Walsh Ctr Rehabil Res,Northern Clin Sch, Reserve Rd, St Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia; [Ball, Jonathon] Royal North Shore Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Reserve Rd, St Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia; [Burns, Brian] Greater Sydney Area Helicopter Emergency Med Serv, Bankstown, NSW 2200, Australia; [Flower, Oliver] Royal North Shore Hosp, Dept Intens Care, Reserve Rd, St Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia; [Joseph, Anthony] Royal North Shore Hosp, Dept Trauma, Reserve Rd, St Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia; [Stanford, Ralph] Prince Wales Private Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Barker St, Randwick, NSW 2031, Australia";Sharwood, LN (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Kolling Inst, Sydney Med Sch, John Walsh Ctr Rehabil Res,Northern Clin Sch, Reserve Rd, St Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia.;lisa.sharwood@sydney.edu.au;"Sharwood, Lisa N/I-5157-2019; Joseph, Anthony/AAA-3774-2019; Stanford, Ralph/AAV-2726-2020; Ball, Jonathon/K-1076-2015";"Sharwood, Lisa N/0000-0001-8977-6144; Stanford, Ralph/0000-0002-4547-8927; Ball, Jonathon/0000-0003-0594-8063";University of Sydney, Sydney Medical School as part of the Early Career Research Grants scheme;LNS acknowledges funding from The University of Sydney, Sydney Medical School as part of the Early Career Research Grants scheme.;;24;3;3;1;4;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;1471-227X;;;BMC EMERG MED;BMC Emerg.

Expert consensus guidelines currently suggest that all athletes who sustain acute concussion be managed with a conservative approach consisting of relative rest and gradual resumption of school and sport activities with active intervention reserved for those with persistent post-concussion symptoms lasting >10-14 days for adults. Unfortunately, these recommendations place little emphasis on the rapid physical deconditioning that occurs in athletes within days of exercise cessation or the pathophysiological processes responsible for acute concussion symptoms that can be successfully targeted by evidence-based rehabilitation strategies. Based on our evolving approach to patients with persistent post-concussion symptoms, we now present an updated physiological approach to the initial medical assessment, rehabilitation, and multi-disciplinary management of collegiate and professional athletes with acute concussion. Utilizing the results of a careful clinical history, comprehensive physical examination and graded aerobic exercise testing, we outline how team physicians, and athletic training staff can partner with multi-disciplinary experts in traumatic brain injury to develop individually tailored rehabilitation programs that target the main physiological causes of acute concussion symptoms (autonomic nervous system dysfunction/exercise intolerance, vestibulo-ocular dysfunction, and cervical spine dysfunction) while maintaining the athlete's physical fitness during the recovery period. Considerations for multi-disciplinary medical clearance of collegiate and professional athletes as well as the application of this approach to non-elite athletes are also discussed.;"[Ellis, Michael J.] Univ Manitoba, Childrens Hosp, Dept Surg Pediat & Child Hlth,Res Inst Manitoba, Sect Neurosurg,Canada North Concuss Network, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Ellis, Michael J.; Cordingley, Dean] Pan Concuss Program, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Leddy, John] UBMD, Dept Orthqoaed & Sports Med, Buffalo, NY USA; [Cordingley, Dean] Pan Clin Fdn, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Willer, Barry] SUNY Buffalo, Jacobs Sch Med & Biomed Sci, Dept Psychiat, Buffalo, NY USA";"Ellis, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Childrens Hosp, Dept Surg Pediat & Child Hlth,Res Inst Manitoba, Sect Neurosurg,Canada North Concuss Network, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.; Ellis, MJ (corresponding author), Pan Concuss Program, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.";mellis3@panamclinic.com;;;"University of Manitoba, Department of Surgery Thorlakson Fund; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [R01NS094444, R01NS094444, R01NS094444, R01NS094444, R01NS094444] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";Financial support of this manuscript was provided by the University of Manitoba, Department of Surgery Thorlakson Fund.;;143;3;3;0;6;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;1664-2295;;;FRONT NEUROL;Front.

While pathophysiological mechanisms are heavily studied and increasingly well understood, psychosocial needs are much less explored. The disease impact on the everyday life of patients including school and work is poorly studied. The purpose of the study was to identify the spectrum of unmet needs of children, adolescents and adults living with autoinflammatory disease and their families, to define key unmet needs and strategies and to develop and evaluate a pilot intervention addressing the unmet need school.MethodsA single-center, mixed-method study of AID patients and their families was conducted. Consecutive patients ages 4years and their families were included. Expert consulting, focus groups and questionnaires explored the patient perspective of unmet needs in AID. Quantitative and qualitative content analyses were performed and informed the development of a framework of unmet needs. A targeted pilot multimodular intervention for the unmet need school was developed and tested. Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was evaluated using DISABKIDS-questionnaires and psychosocial impact evaluations.ResultsThe study included 83 patients and their families. These were 14 children, 9 adolescents and 25 adults with AID and 35 family members; patients' median age was 19years (5-78). Expert consultations: 110 AID patients with 320 visits/year; 99 (90%) were children and adolescents. 78 patients and family members (94%) participated in 10 groups. Qualitative content analysis delineated 9 domains of unmet needs, the most relevant being school, health care system and public institutions. The pilot interventionschool included 18 participants; median age was 9years (7-16). HRQoL improved with the intervention including understanding by 53%, however improvement was not sustained over time.ConclusionUnmet needs of AID patients and families affect all areas of life.

Facing this scenario, the parenteral route of biologics administration as hitherto standard route is inconvenient for the future. Among the alternatives, the intranasal delivery of therapeutic biologicals seems to be most promising but researchers are still facing challenges as indicated by the scarce number of successfully marketed peptide drugs. Areas covered: This review article is a compilation of current research focusing on achievements in the field of auxiliary agents for biologics delivery. First, the key benefits of the nose as most promising alternative route of drug administration are highlighted. Then, the potential of the different auxiliary agents in preclinical research is in detail discussed. Moreover, the most used permeation enhancing agents, mucolytic agents, mucoadhesive agents, in situ gelling agents and enzyme inhibiting agents in the formulation of nasal drug delivery systems are described. Thus, the overall purpose of this review is to highlight recent achievements in nasal delivery of biologics and to encourage researchers to work in the direction of needle-free nasal administration of biologics. Expert opinion: The nasal epithelium is a promising route for biologics administration, which is reflected in a number of well-established products on the market treating chronic diseases as well as a large number of clinical trials currently in progress.

In depression sadness and emotional misery manifest in facial expressions, as psychomotor slowing, lack of energy, high tension, and attenuated sensory perception. Loss of appetite, changes to the taste of food, and the loss of pleasure in eating are important criteria in the diagnosis of DD. We hypothesized that a patient's facial expressions and emotional responses to different tastes can be used as the diagnostic moderators for the development of a new contactless, computer-based method for diagnosis of DD. The confirmation of this hypothesis can shed a new perspective on early contactless, computer-based psychiatric diagnostic strategies and early identification of DD symptoms, as DD is an important issue in public mental health. The bene fits of this method are evidence from several perspectives (I) patients can use a self-rating instrument to assess DD symptoms; this may act as an incentive to seek professional help; (II) family and community can use an instrument for early recognition of DD symptoms and suicidal tendencies, making it possible to encourage the individual to seek professional health care; (III) general practitioners have a reliable instrument for preliminary diagnosis of DD in primary care, thus saving the time and resources; (IV) public health bene fits include early diagnosis and treatment of DD and better outcomes, reductions in disability-adjusted life years and the global burden of the disease. It is nevertheless important to recognize the limitations and risks of contactless diagnosis of DD. As it is a self-assessment method it is not possible to rule out false positives and false negatives. However, this method might be used for early diagnosis of DD symptoms. Also, it should be mentioned that further evaluation and an experts opinion about this method is needed. The clinical diagnosis of DD should continue to be made by healthcare professionals.

Their activities are closely related to the fine details of their structures. Unlike the simple linear chains of proteins, branching is a unique feature of glycan structures, making their identification extremely challenging. Multistage mass spectrometry (MSn) has become the primary method for glycan structural identification. The major difficulty for MSn is the selection of fragment ions as precursors for the next stage of scanning. Widely used strategies are either manual selection by experienced experts, which requires considerable expertise and time, or simply selecting the most intense peaks by which the product-ion spectrum generated may not be structurally informative and therefore fail to make the assignment. We here report a glycan intelligent precursor selection strategy (GIPS) to guide MSn experiments. Our approach consists of two key elements, an empirical model to calculate candidate glycan's probability and a statistical model to calculate fragment ion's distinguishing power in order to select the structurally most informative peak as the precursor for next-stage scanning. Using 15 glycan standards, including three pairs with isomeric sequences and eight variously fucosylated oligosaccharides on linear or branched hexasaccharide backbones isolated from a human milk oligosaccharide fraction by HPLC, we demonstrate its successful application to branching pattern analysis with improved efficiency and sensitivity and also the potential for automated operation.;"[Sun, Shiwei; Wang, Yaojun; Zhang, Jingwei; Gao, Feng; Yang, Fei; Bu, Dongbo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Key Lab Intelligent Informat Proc, 6 Kexueyuan South Rd, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China; [Huang, Chuncui; Liu, Yaming; Zhou, Jinyu; Chen, Runsheng; Li, Yan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, 15 Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Sun, Shiwei; Wang, Yaojun; Liu, Yaming; Zhang, Jingwei; Zhou, Jinyu; Gao, Feng; Yang, Fei; Chen, Runsheng; Li, Yan; Bu, Dongbo] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, 19 Yuquan Rd, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Mulloy, Barbara; Chai, Wengang] Imperial Coll London, Glycosci Lab, Fac Med, London W12 0NN, England";"Bu, DB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Key Lab Intelligent Informat Proc, 6 Kexueyuan South Rd, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China.; Li, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, 15 Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Li, Y; Bu, DB (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, 19 Yuquan Rd, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.; Chai, WG (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Glycosci Lab, Fac Med, London W12 0NN, England.";"w.chai@imperial.ac.uk; yanli@ibp.ac.cn; dbu@ict.ac.cn";;"Chai, Wengang/0000-0003-2977-5347; sun, shi wei/0000-0002-0351-3720";"National High-Tech Research and Development ProjectNational High Technology Research and Development Program of China [2014AA021101]; Scientific Equipment Development Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences [YZ201249]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31270834, 61272318, 31270909, 31600650, 31671369, 31770775]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC0910405]; March of Dimes research centre grantMarch of Dimes; Francis Crick Institute";We thank the National High-Tech Research and Development Project (2014AA021101), the Scientific Equipment Development Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences (YZ201249), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 31270834, 61272318, 31270909, 31600650, 31671369, and 31770775), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC0910405), and the March of Dimes research centre grant for providing partial financial support.

In some cases, such as team sports, many cooperative behaviors can be visually categorized and labeled manually by experts. However, these actions which are manually categorized with the same label based on its function have low spatiotemporal similarity. In other words, it is difficult to find similar and different structures of the motions with the same and different labels, respectively. Here, we propose an automatic recognition system for strategic cooperative plays, which are the minimal, basic, and diverse plays in a ball game. Using player's moving distance, geometric information, and distances among players, the proposed method accurately discriminated not only the cooperative plays in a primary area, i.e., near the ball, but also those distant from a primary area. We also propose a method to classify more detailed types of cooperative plays in various situations. The proposed framework, which sheds light on inconspicuous players to play important roles, could have a potential to detect well-defined and labeled cooperative behaviors.;"[Hojo, Motokazu; Fujii, Keisuke; Kawahara, Yoshinobu] RIKEN, Ctr Adv Intelligence Project, Osaka, Japan; [Inaba, Yuki] Japanese Inst Sports Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Motoyasu, Yoichi] Tokuyama Univ, Yamaguchi, Japan; [Kawahara, Yoshinobu] Osaka Univ, Inst Sci & Ind Res, Osaka, Japan";Fujii, K (corresponding author), RIKEN, Ctr Adv Intelligence Project, Osaka, Japan.;keisuke.fujii.zh@riken.jp;"KAWAHARA, Yoshinobu/AAM-7540-2020; Fujii, Keisuke/AAJ-1330-2020; Kawahara, Yoshinobu/J-2462-2014";"Fujii, Keisuke/0000-0001-5487-4297; Kawahara, Yoshinobu/0000-0001-7789-4709";"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [18H03287];  [16K12995]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16K12995] Funding Source: KAKEN";This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 16K12995 to KF and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, 18H03287 to YK.

Rates of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) are comparable to those in high-income countries. The program's evolution has been characterized by ambitious target setting and innovative strategies that have not been widely described. Methods: We reviewed national and provincial health department archives; analyzed disease surveillance, vaccination coverage, and serosurvey data from 1950 through 2016; and, conducted in-depth interviews with senior Chinese experts involved early VPD control efforts. Results: Widespread immunization began in the 1950s with smallpox, diphtheria, and Bacillus-Calmette Guerin vaccines, and in the 1960s with pertussis, tetanus, polio, measles, and Japanese encephalitis (jE) vaccines. The largest drops in absolute VPD burden occurred in the 1970s with establishment of the Rural Cooperative Medical System and a cadre of trained peasant health workers whose responsibilities included vaccinations. From 1970 to 1979, incidence per 100,000 population dropped 48% from 3.3 to 1.75 for diphtheria, 50% from 152.2 to 49.4 for pertussis, 77% from 2.5 to 0.6 for polio, 60% from 450.5 to 178.3 for measles, and 72% from 18.0 to 5.1 for JE, averting an average of 4 million VPD cases each year. Until the early 1980s, vaccines were delivered through annual winter campaigns using a coordinated 'rush-relay' system to expedite transport while leveraging vaccine thermostability. Establishment of the cold chain system during in the 1980s allowed bi-monthly vaccination rounds and more timely vaccination resulting in rates of diphtheria, pertussis, measles and meningitis falling over 90% from 1980 to 1989, while polio and JE rates fell 40-50%. In the 1990s, progress stalled as financing for public health was weakened by broad market reforms. Large investments in public health and immunizations by the central government since 2004 has led to further declines in VPD burden and increased equity. During 20112016, the incidence per 100,000 population was <2.0 for measles and <0.2 for pertussis, JE, meningococcal meningitis, and hepatitis A. From 1992 to 2014, the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection in children <5 years fell from 9.7% to 0.3%, a 97% decline. China was certified polio-free in 2000 and diphtheria was last reported in 2006. Conclusions: Long-term political commitment to immunizations as a basic right, ambitious targets, use of disease incidence as the primary metric to assess program performance, and nationwide scale-up of successful locally developed strategies that optimized use of available limited resources have been critical to China's success in controlling vaccine-preventable diseases.

Method: Exploratory focus groups were held with stakeholders from five geographically diverse regions across Ontario between September 2011 and January 2012. Participants were asked to consider the recommendations, list perceived barriers and to collectively discuss potential solutions. Data analysis included coding of transcribed data, sorting material to identify themes and confronting themes with a formalized body of knowledge. Results: Barriers identified by participants fell into three categories: patient-centered, clinician-focused and resource or system based, within these, specific challenges included managing patients' medical and emotional readiness for rehabilitation, timely completion of medical tests, staff comfort in discharging patients, dedicated transportation and funding-related concerns.

Despite the value of comprehensive assessment of patients on admission, the process is often sub-optimal due to a lack of standardized assessment practices. This project aimed to develop a concise, integrated assessment for patients admitted to acute care and test its psychometric properties. Methods: Two international expert panels of clinicians and health scientists collaborated to establish design parameters. Using clinical observations and a variety of derivative applications sourced from the interRAI research collaborative repository, the panels constructed a draft instrument to examine feasibility, resource requirements, and inter-rater reliability. Field testing was conducted in Australia and Canada. Next, the system was revised to its final form, the interRAI Acute Care, after feedback and review from international interRAI members. Results : Constructed using 56 items, the interRAI Acute Care required a median of 15 minutes to complete. Inter-rater reliability tested on 130 paired assessments was substantial to almost perfect for 78% of the clinical items and moderate for the remaining 22% of items. A subset of 30 items from the admission assessment comprised the discharge assessment. Discussion: The interRAI Acute Care has been shown to be an efficient nursing assessment instrument with good psychometric properties.

The Member States have implemented this obligation with different methods and levels of accuracy. Based on these motivations, in Italy, the Emilia-Romagna Region (ERR) has activated its own Energy Performance Certificate Control System. We describes the Control System in Europe, compared to existing works, the procedure adopted in the ERR, and the results of the control campaigns in 2016 and 2017. The methodology provides for control over both the EPC Drafts and EPCs Issued, carried out on two levels: checks and on-site inspection. The results show the impact of the EPC control on the technicians, EPC quality and they highlight the recurring mistake during EPC compilation: which should be divided in two categories: technicians who have misunderstood the laws and standards and other technicians whose work entails negligence or illicit activity. Moreover, the results show the effectiveness of such solutions and the extent of the independent control system to verify the work of the independent experts and the contents of the EPCs. We report a customer satisfaction survey about the EPC control and validation. Advantages of this work that it is possible to carry out widespread EPC control, and it reports an improvement in the quality of the EPCs, moreover it is first study about independent control in Italy.

In this paper a hybrid genetic programing model integrated with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based Copula technique is developed to incorporate climate-based inputs as the predictors of cotton yield, for selected study regions: Faisalabad (31.4504 degrees N, 73.1350 degrees E), Multan (30.1984 degrees N, 71.4687 degrees E) and Nawabshah (26.2442 degrees N, 68.4100 degrees E), as important cotton growing hubs in the developing nation of Pakistan. Several different types of GP-MCMC-copula models were developed, each with the well-known copula families (i.e., Gaussian, student t, Clayton, Gumble Frank and Fischer-Hinzmann functions) to screen and utilize an optimal cotton yield forecast model for the present study region. The results of the GP-MCMC based hybrid copula model were evaluated with a standalone GP and the MCMC based copula model in accordance with statistical analysis of the predicted yield based on correlation coefficient (r), Willmott's index (WI), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) in the independent test phase. Further performance preciseness was evaluated by the Akiake Information Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Maximum Likelihood (Max(L)) for the GP-MCMC based copula as well as the MCMC based copula model. GP-MCMC-Clayton copula model generated the most accurate result for the Multan station. For the optimal GP-MCMC-Clayton copula model, the acquired model evaluation metrics for Multan were: (LM approximate to 0.952; RRMSE approximate to 2.107%; RRMAE approximate to 1.771%) followed by the MCMC based Gaussian copula model (LM approximate to 0.895; RRMSE approximate to 4.541%; RRMAE approximate to 0.3.214%) and the standalone GP model (LM approximate to 0.132; RRMSE approximate to 23.638%; RRMAE approximate to 22.652%), indicating the superiority of the GP-MCMC-Clayton copula model in respect to the other benchmark models. The performance of GP-MCMC based copula model was also found to be superior in the case of Faisalabad and Nawabshah station as confirmed by AIC, BIC, Max(L) metrics, including a larger value of the Legates-McCabe's (LM) index, utilized in conjunction with the relative percentage RRMSE and the relative mean absolute error (RMAE). Accordingly, it is averred that the developed GP-MCMC copula model can be considered as a pertinent data-intelligent tool used for accurate prediction of cotton yield, utilizing the readily available climate datasets in agricultural regions and is of relevance to agricultural yield simulation and sectoral decision-making.";"[Ali, Mumtaz; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Downs, Nathan J.; Maraseni, Tek] Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Life Sci & Environm, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia";"Ali, M; Deo, RC (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Life Sci & Environm, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia.";"Mumtaz.Ali@usq.edu.au; ravinesh.deo@usq.edu.au";"Ali, Mumtaz/AAF-8685-2020; Deo, Ravinesh/F-6157-2012";"Ali, Mumtaz/0000-0002-6975-5159; Deo, Ravinesh/0000-0002-2290-6749";University of Southern Queensland's Office of Graduate Studies Postgraduate Research Scholarship;This research utilized cotton yield data acquired from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, Government of Pakistan: Islamabad, Pakistan and climate data were acquired from Pakistan Meteorological Department, Pakistan, that are duly acknowledged.

However, only a few studies highlighted gas pollutants removal performance of UV/chlorine method in real water. In this study, nitrogen oxide (NOx) removal using UV-irradiated electrolyzed seawater (UV/electrolyzed seawater) was explored under simulated seawater environment in a semi-batch photochemical reactor. Comparison experiments between UV/H2O2 and UV/chlorine in both freshwater and seawater systems were performed. Results showed that NO removal efficiency in UV/chlorine freshwater system was higher than those in UV/chlorine seawater system, due to radical scavenging effects of water matrices in seawater. Several strong reactive radicals (e.g., (OH)-O-center dot, Cl-center dot, (OCl)-O-center dot, ClOH center dot-) yielded from UV/chlorine system were considered to contribute to NOx removal, among which the role of (OH)-O-center dot radical was confirmed by radical-trapping experiments. The alkalinity of the seawater adversely impacted contributions of these reactive radicals to NOx removal, which caused a sharp drop in NOx removal efficiencies. Comparatively, the chloride ion in seawater had slight influences on NOx removal efficiencies of UV/electrolyzed seawater. Then, optimization of NOx removal efficiencies against three key variables (active chlorine concentration, UV irradiation dose, and initial pH) was investigated in simulated seawater using Design Expert Software. A regression model of NOx removal efficiency was obtained with satisfactory accuracy. Results indicated that active chlorine concentration and UV irradiation dose significantly influenced NOx removal efficiencies, compared with pH effects. Furthermore, NOx removal mechanisms involved in reactive radicals were discussed for UV/electrolyzed seawater method. Due to pH-dependent characteristics of both active chlorine species and carbonate species in electrolyzed seawater, NOx removal pathways by UV/electrolyzed seawater were different as the environment changed from acid to alkalinity.;"[Yang, Shaolong] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yang, Shaolong] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Adv Ship & Deep Sea Explor, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Yang, Shaolong] Hubei Key Lab Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn Hyd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Han, Zhitao; Pan, Xinxiang; Liu, Bojun; Zhao, Dongsheng] Dalian Maritime Univ, Marine Engn Coll, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China";"Han, ZT; Pan, XX (corresponding author), Dalian Maritime Univ, Marine Engn Coll, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China.";"hanzt@dlmu.edu.cn; panxx@dlmu.edu.cn";Yang, Shaolong/H-4922-2013;Yang, Shaolong/0000-0003-2566-9803;"National Natural Science Foundation of China, ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51779024]; HUST, China Scientific Research Foundation [3004140108]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [3132017003, 2018KFYYXJJ015]";This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, China [grant number 51779024], HUST, China Scientific Research Foundation for the introduction of talent [grant number 3004140108], the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [grant numbers 3132017003 and 2018KFYYXJJ015].;;48;6;7;3;53;ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA;LAUSANNE;PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND;1385-8947;1873-3212;;CHEM ENG J;Chem.

Transportation and mobility, however, remains a pressing challenge. This study asks: what are the greatest national and regional transport challenges facing Nordic countries? To provide an answer, the authors conducted 227 semi-structured interviews with participants from 201 institutions across seventeen cities within the Nordic region. Those interviewed represent a diverse array of stakeholders involved with transport technology, policy and practice. Although respondents identified 44 distinct transport challenges, the fossil fuel intensity of transport was by far the most frequently mentioned by more than two-fifths (42%) of the expert sample. Five other challenges were also mentioned the most frequently by respondents: long travel distances (17%), the state of public transport infrastructure (16%), congestion (15%), population density (10%), and electrification of transport (10%). Interestingly, items such as costs and affordability, energy or transport efficiency, consumer knowledge and awareness, and automobile accidents were mentioned by only 3% (or less). The article concludes by what this heterogeneity and prioritization of challenges means for future Nordic research and policy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

At present, the study of an outcome on a population-based cohort is hypothesis-driven, i.e. the expert must specify the variables to be studied. Our approach rather operates in a data-driven, semi-automated way, enabling the expert to identify variables of relevance and generate hypotheses on them. Methods: Our system DIVA supports the Discovery, Inspection and VAlidation of subpopulations with increased prevalence of an outcome, without requiring parameter tuning. DIVA takes as input the cohort of an epidemiological population-based study with all variables specified in the study's protocol, as well as inputs from the expert on the similarity of a small number of cohort participants. DIVA uses semi supervised subspace clustering and subspace construction to identify sets of variables - subspaces - that promote participant similarity with respect to the outcome and with respect to the expert inputs, and then discovers subpopulations with increased outcome prevalence in those subspaces (DIVA module DRESS). DIVA uses visual analytics techniques to assist the expert in juxtaposing, filtering and inspecting the characteristics of these subpopulations (web-based DIVA module D-INSPECTOR). If the expert has access to a second cohort on a comparable population, DIVA aligns the cohort used for discovery to this second cohort, and then checks whether the subpopulations found in the original cohort are also present in the second one (DIVA module VALIDATOR). Results: We applied DIVA to the third wave (SHIP-2) of the SHIP-CORE cohort of the Study of Health in Pomerania (Volzke et al., 2011) for the liver disorder hepatic steatosis, and on the first wave (TREND-0) of the SHIP-TREND cohort of the same study for the thyroid gland disorder goitre. We found that most of the subpopulations extracted automatically, and subsequently ranked and filtered by the modules of DIVA, had significantly higher disease prevalence than the general population. We varied the amount of inputs needed from the expert to drive the subpopulation extraction process and found that a very small amount of information, namely the outcome of as few as 4 cohort participants, is sufficient for the identification of several relevant variables and subpopulations. We used a subset of TREND-0 for the validation on goitre and the complete TREND-0 for the validation on hepatic steatosis and found that the significant difference in prevalence for the identified subpopulation also holds in the validation data. Conclusions: We have shown that DIVA discovers subpopulations and variables of importance with respect to an outcome, while requiring a very small amount of expert inputs. Each combination of variables and each subpopulation corresponds to a hypothesis, the validation of which would have required substantial human effort. Thus, DIVA allows for a more effective exploitation of population-based data, not fully automated but driven by the expert and without the need for technical parameter tuning. A shortcoming of DIVA design is the demand of a specific type of expert inputs, namely constraints on the similarity of pairs of participants. Currently, we generate the constraints with a naive utility that is based on random sampling, but we work on the development of an interactive algorithm that would allow the epidemiology expert to inspect a small choice of study participant and give statements on their similarity. The present version of DIVA considers a single wave of the cohort data, ignoring the evolution of the population during the horizon of the study. Hence, subspace and subpopulation discovery do not take account of changes in the importance of variables. We currently work on the incorporation of algorithms that derive additional variables from the longitudinal data and use them in the Discovery module. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In the off-line learning stage, the classifier is trained to diagnose the known faults and the normal operation state using the Density Oriented Fuzzy C-Means and the Kernel Fuzzy C-Means algorithms. In this stage, the historical data previously selected by experts, are firstly pre-processed to eliminate outliers and reduce the confusion in the classification process by using the Density Oriented Fuzzy C-Means algorithm. Later on, the Kernel Fuzzy C-Means algorithm is used for achieving greater separability among the classes and reducing the classification errors. Finally, the optimization of the two parameters used by these algorithms in the training stage is developed by using a bio-inspired optimization algorithm, namely the differential evolution. After the training, the classifier is used online (online diagnosis stage) in order to classify the new observations that are collected from the process. In this stage, the detection of novel faults based on density by using the DOFCM algorithm is applied. The algorithm analyzes the observations belonging to a window of time which were not classified into the known classes and it is determined if they are a new class or outliers. If a new class is identified, a procedure is developed to incorporate it to the known classes set. The proposed approach was validated using the Development and Application of Methods for Actuator Diagnosis in Industrial Control Systems (DAMADICS) benchmark. The results obtained indicate the feasibility of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The system allows tracking of several objects in real-time in a smart home context and is a building block toward the deployment of an expert system to enable aging in place through technology. The indoor localization is modelled as a classification problem, instead of a regression problem as commonly seen in the literature. The paper is divided in two parts. The first one focuses on the ground truth collection that led to the model construction. The second part focuses on the filters that were designed to enable this model to be used in real-time in the smart home as a tracking software. Results from the first part show that most classifiers perform well on the static positioning of RFID tags task, with a random forest of 100 trees performing best at 97% accuracy and 0.9740974 F-Measure. However, collecting data to train the classifier is a long and tedious process. Results from the second part indicate that the accuracy of the random forest drops significantly when confronted with human interference. With the help of some filters, the tracking accuracy of objects can still be as high as 75%. Those results confirm that using passive RFID tags for an indoor tracking system is viable.

As ensemble learning algorithms, boosting algorithms build classifiers by composing a set of weak hypotheses. The high computational cost of boosting algorithms in learning from large volumes of data such as text categorization datasets is a real challenge. Most boosting algorithms, such as AdaBoost.MH, iteratively examine all training features to generate the weak hypotheses, which increases the learning time. RFBoost was introduced to manage this problem based on a rank-and-filter strategy in which it first ranks the training features and then, in each learning iteration, filters and uses only a subset of the highest-ranked features to construct the weak hypotheses. This step ensures accelerated learning time for RFBoost compared to AdaBoost.MH, as the weak hypotheses produced in each iteration are reduced to a very small number. As feature ranking is the core idea of RFBoost, this paper presents and investigates seven feature ranking methods (information gain, chi-square, GSS-coefficient, mutual information, odds ratio, F1 score, and accuracy) in order to improve RFBoost's performance. Moreover, an accelerated version of RFBoost, called RFBoost1, is also introduced. Rather than filtering a subset of the highest-ranked features, FBoost1 selects only one feature, based on its weight, to build a new weak hypothesis. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets for multi-label text categorization) Reuters-21578, 20-Newsgroups, OHSUMED, and TMC2007(demonstrate that among the methods evaluated for feature ranking, mutual information yields the best performance for RFBoost. In addition, the results prove that RFBoost statistically outperforms both RFBoost1 and AdaBoost.MH on all datasets. Finally, RFBoost1 proved more efficient than AdaBoost.MH, making it a better alternative for addressing classification problems in real-life applications and expert systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

At present, it is widely used in many fields, such as fault diagnosis, medical diagnosis and prediction, financial analysis and prediction, decision support, etc. How to construct the Bayesian network effectively is an important research problem in the area of data mining. The constraint-based learning algorithm is commonly used for the construction of Bayesian network (BNs), such as Fast Incremental Association (Fast-IAMB) and Max-Min Parents & Children (MMPC), etc. At present, the Chi square test and correlation coefficient are often used to calculate the correlation between variables in these algorithms. But the calculation accuracy of these methods is not high, thus to influence the effectiveness of the constraint-based BNs learning algorithms. On the basis of the entropy estimation approach of Gaussian kernel probability density estimator, this paper uses the (conditional) mutual information to calculate the correlation between different variables and thus to improve the learning accuracy of the constraint-based BNs learning algorithms. The concrete calculation process about the data type of discrete, continuous and mixed has been described separately. Experiment simulations on the Alarm network prove that our algorithm can improve the learning accuracy of the existing three kinds of constraint-based BNs learning algorithms without affecting the learning efficiency. It also has better learning effect when to process the concrete and continuous data with sparsity. The method in this work can be used to learn more accurate Bayesian network, and then served the research of artificial intelligence, expert system decision making, etc. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, an innovative, cost effective and attractive method which depends on duckweed-based wastewater treatment systems coupled with microbial fuel cell reactor (DWWT-MFC) was investigated for B-polluted domestic wastewater treatment and simultaneous electricity generation for the first time in an eco-technological study. Lemma gibba L. was selected as a model duckweed species, and different reactors were also designed to identify which mechanisms are dominant for B removal in a DWWT-MFC reactor matrix. DWWT-MFC reactor achieved 71% B removal in experiment period, and the plant effect on B removal mechanisms in the reactor matrix was recorded as 37.7 +/- 4.92% (F = 2.543, p < 0.05). However, supplementary aeration and microbial effects on B removal were determined as negligible. Average maximum voltage output was found as 1.47 V, and maximum power density was 34.8 mW/m(2) at a current density of 43.9 mA/m(2) with supplementary aeration. Moreover, DWWT-MFC reactor achieved 84%, 81% and 76% of COD, NH(4)(+ )and PO43- removal efficiencies, respectively. Moreover, L. gibba grew well in the anode chamber of DWWT-MFC with an average biomass yield of 218 +/- 43 g/m(2) and a total chlorophyll (a + b) concentration of 30.2 mg g(-1), which indicates that anolyte environment was not toxic for L. gibba growth. Consequently, it can be suggested that environmental experts may use DWWT-MFC as an efficient removal method to treat B from domestic wastewater and to produce bioelectricity.;[Turker, Onur Can] Aksaray Univ, Fac Sci & Letters, Dept Biol, Aksaray, Turkey;Turker, OC (corresponding author), Aksaray Univ, Fac Sci & Letters, Dept Biol, Aksaray, Turkey.;octurker@aksaray.edu.tr;;;;;;31;8;8;2;65;ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;LONDON;24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND;0301-4797;1095-8630;;J ENVIRON MANAGE;J.

For this purpose, Ecological Integrity (EI) is a useful concept that seeks to capture the complex nature of ecosystems and their interaction with social welfare. But the challenge remains to measure EI and translate scientific terminology into operational language to inform society. We propose an approach that simplifies marine ecosystem complexity by applying scientific knowledge to identify which components reflect the state or state change of ecosystems. It follows a bottom-up structure that identifies, based on expert knowledge, biological components related with past and present changing conditions. It is structured in 5 stages that interact in an adaptive way: stage 1, in situ observations suggest changes could be happening; stage 2 explores available data that represent EI; stage 3, experts' workshops target the identification of the minimum set of variables needed to define EI, or the risk of losing EI; an optative stage 4, where deviance from EI, or risk of deviance, is statistically assessed; stage 5, findings are communicated to society. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness in three case studies, including a data poor situation, an area where lack of reference sites hampers the identification of historical changes, and an area where diffuse sources of stress make it difficult to identify simple relationships with of ecological responses.

However, the fine tuning of NIL process parameters is critical in achieving defect-free imprints. Currently, there exists no unified material and process design guidelines to deal with the complex set of process parameters. In this research, an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm was developed to predict the imprint quality based on a set of input factors collected from experiments and literature. The prediction accuracy was tested in two stages by the use of three ANN models - General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). Higher prediction accuracy was observed for GRNN in both stages (1st stage = 58.22% and 2nd stage = 92.37%). A significant increase in the prediction accuracy was observed in the second stage after including additional input factors and larger data set. The average prediction accuracies for GRNN, BPNN, and PNN in the second stage were reported as 92.37%, 84.79%, and 91.19%, respectively. The prediction of the GRNN model was validated with experimental results confirming the accurate classification of all the outputs. This research lays the foundation for the development of an expert system for nanoimprint lithography.

This requirement often results in many systems being left insecure due to a lack of analysis expertise and access to specialist resources. It has long been known that a system's event logs provide historical information depicting potential security breaches, as well as recording configuration activities. However, identifying and utilising knowledge within the event logs is challenging for the non-expert. In this paper, a novel technique is developed to process security event logs of a computer that has been assessed and configured by a security professional, extract key domain knowledge indicative of their expert decision making, and automatically apply learnt knowledge to previously unseen systems by non-experts. The technique converts event log entries into an object-based model and dynamically extracts associative rules. The rules are further improved in terms of quality using a temporal metric to autonomously establish temporal-association rules and acquire a domain model of expert configuration tasks. The acquired domain model and problem instance generated from a previously unseen system can then be used to produce a plan-of-action, which can be exploited by non-professionals to improve their system's security. Empirical analysis is subsequently performed on 20 event logs, where identified plan traces are discussed in terms of accuracy and performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to manage this process, Value Methodologies are considered as an important decision support tool, especially by means of the calculation of the Value Index factor, I-vf, for each one of the product functions as a representation of its 'satisfaction'-to-cost relationship. However, given the subjective nature of the 'satisfaction' metric used in its calculation, the process of formulating the Value Index for the different product functions is a complex matter. In this paper, a novel expert system is described for evaluating and selecting design alternatives based on the development of a new methodology for calculating the Value Index factor. The system takes into account efficient management of the uncertainty inherent in the operations by using two concurrent fuzzy-inference processes. The first of these processes manages the determination of the Value Index factor, while the second calculates the Perceived Value factor, a term associated with the risk derived from not modifying the initial parameters in the calculation of the Value Index itself. An autonomous decision system is thus obtained that not only evaluates, selects and recommends the best design alternative, but which also determines the strength of the selection. In addition to the description of this system, a case study is presented that shows the potential benefits obtained from the new methods thus developed. These methods make it possible to improve the use of Value Indices as decision factors in the design process and also to provide new perspectives on the selection of alternatives in the context of Value Methodologies.

It provides a system configuration with exceedingly higher reliability than existing RAPs under same constraints. However, its solution space is significantly expanded according to the number of candidate types and the scale of the system, and thus this study proposed a parallel genetic algorithm with a knowledge base (PGAKB) to efficiently solve it. It includes two strategies, which are the emulation of an expert system and the cooperation between GAs. An individual of the PGAKB creates and exploits the knowledge of the society, and the accumulated knowledge is used for the local search, the final stage for the PGAKB. In conclusion, for solving a complex optimization problem, the PGAKB operates in the form of an expert system and describes a society developing itself by accumulating knowledge. Furthermore, regarding the quality and robustness of solutions and computational time, the effectiveness of the PGAKB was analytically demonstrated by experiments on a famous example.

We have developed a curation support tool, neXtA(5), that provides a search engine coupled with an annotation system directly integrated into a biocuration workflow. neXtA(5) assists curation with modules optimized for the thevarious curation tasks: document triage, entity recognition and information extraction. Here, we describe the evaluation of neXtA(5) by expert curators. We first assessed the annotations of two independent curators to provide a baseline for comparison. To evaluate the performance of neXtA(5), we submitted requests and compared the neXtA(5) results with the manual curation. The analysis focuses on the usability of neXtA(5) to support the curation of two types of data: biological processes (BPs) and diseases (Ds). We evaluated the relevance of the papers proposed as well as the recall and precision of the suggested annotations. The evaluation of document triage by neXtA(5) precision showed that both curators agree with neXtA(5) for 67 (BP) and 63% (D) of abstracts, while curators agree on accepting or rejecting an abstract similar to 80% of the time. Hence, the precision of the triage system is satisfactory. For concept extraction, curators approved 35 (BP) and 25% (D) of the neXtA(5) annotations. Conversely, neXtA(5) successfully annotated up to 36 (BP) and 68% (D) of the terms identified by curators. The user feedback obtained in these tests highlighted the need for improvement in the ranking function of neXtA(5) annotations. Therefore, we transformed the information extraction component into an annotation ranking system. This improvement results in a top precision (precision at first rank) of 59 (D) and 63% (BP). These results suggest that when considering only the first extracted entity, the current system achieves a precision comparable with expert biocurators.;"[Britan, Aurore; Cusin, Isabelle; Hinard, Valerie; de Laval, Valentine Rech; Gleizes, Anne; Teixeira, Daniel; Michel, Pierre-Andre; Gaudet, Pascale] SIB Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Comp & Lab Invest Prot Human Origin Grp, 1 Rue Michel Servet, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Mottin, Luc; Pasche, Emilie; Gobeill, Julien; Ruch, Patrick] Haute Ecole Gest Geneve, Haute Ecole Specialisee Suisse Occidentale, 17 Rue Tambourine, CH-1227 Carouge, Switzerland; [Mottin, Luc; Pasche, Emilie; Gobeill, Julien; Ruch, Patrick] SIB Swiss Inst Bioinformat, SIB TextMining, 1 Rue Michel Servet, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland";"Gaudet, P (corresponding author), SIB Swiss Inst Bioinformat, Comp & Lab Invest Prot Human Origin Grp, 1 Rue Michel Servet, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.; Ruch, P (corresponding author), Haute Ecole Gest Geneve, Haute Ecole Specialisee Suisse Occidentale, 17 Rue Tambourine, CH-1227 Carouge, Switzerland.; Ruch, P (corresponding author), SIB Swiss Inst Bioinformat, SIB TextMining, 1 Rue Michel Servet, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.";"patrick.ruch@hesge.ch; pascale.gaudet@sib.swiss";;"Pasche, Emilie/0000-0002-9118-5762; Rech de Laval, Valentine/0000-0002-3020-1490; Gobeill, Julien/0000-0001-9809-7741; Mottin, Luc/0000-0002-9614-9293";Swiss National Fund (SNF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [153437];Swiss National Fund (SNF #153437).;;43;1;1;0;2;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1758-0463;;;DATABASE-OXFORD;Database;DEC 14;2018;;;;;;;;;bay129;10.1093/database/bay129;;;16;Mathematical & Computational Biology;Mathematical & Computational Biology;HE9WE;WOS:000453806800008;30576492;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-02-18;

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is associated with higher morbidity and mortality, higher HIV and HCV infection rates, and criminal behavior. Opioid agonist therapy (OAT; methadone and buprenorphine) is proven to be effective in treating OUD and decreasing its negative consequences. While the efficacy of OAT has been established, too few providers prescribe OAT to patients with OUD due to patient, provider, or system factors. While the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has made great strides in OAT implementation, national treatment rates remain low (35% of patients with OUD) and several facilities continue to have much lower prescribing rates. Methods: Eight VA sites with low baseline prescribing rates (lowest quartile, < 21%) were randomly selected from the 35 low prescribing sites to receive an intensive external facilitation implementation intervention to increase OAT prescribing rates. The intervention includes a site-specific developmental evaluation, a kick-off site visit, and 12 months of ongoing facilitation. The developmental evaluation includes qualitative interviews with patients, substance use disorders clinic staff, and primary care and general mental health leadership to assess site-level barriers. The site visit includes: (1) a review of site-specific barriers and potential implementation strategies; (2) instruction on using available dashboards to track prescribing rates and identify actionable patients; and (3) education on OAT, including, if requested, buprenorphine certification training for prescribers. On-going facilitation consists of monthly conference calls with individual site teams and expert clinical consultation. The primary outcomes is the proportion of Veterans with OUD initiating and sustaining OAT, with intervention sites expected to have larger increases in prescribing compared to control sites. Final qualitative interviews and a cost assessment will inform future implementation efforts. Discussion: This project will examine and respond to barriers encountered in low prescribing VHA clinics allowing refinement of an intervention to enhance access to medication treatment for OUD in additional facilities.";"[Hagedorn, Hildi; Kenny, Marie] Minneapolis Vet Affairs Hlth Care Syst, Ctr Chron Dis Outcomes Res, 1 Vet Dr,Mail Code 152, Minneapolis, MN 55417 USA; [Hagedorn, Hildi] Univ Minnesota, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Gordon, Adam J.] VA Salt Lake City Hlth Care Syst, Informat Decis Enhancement & Analyt Sci Ctr IDEAS, 500 Foothill Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84148 USA; [Gordon, Adam J.] Univ Utah, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Epidemiol,Program Addict Res Clin Care Knowle, 30 N 1900 E, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA; [Ackland, Princess E.] Minneapolis Vet Affairs Hlth Care Syst, Ctr Chron Dis Outcomes Res, South Bldg 9,Rm 316,Mail Code 152, Minneapolis, MN 55417 USA; [Ackland, Princess E.; Noorbaloochi, Siamak] Univ Minnesota, Dept Med, Box 736 UMHC, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Noorbaloochi, Siamak] Minneapolis Vet Affairs Hlth Care Syst, Ctr Chron Dis Outcomes Res, South Bldg 9,Rm 219,Mail Code 152, Minneapolis, MN 55417 USA; [Yu, Wei] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, 795 Willow Rd,152 MPD, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Yu, Wei] Stanford Univ, Ctr Hlth Policy, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Yu, Wei] Stanford Univ, Ctr Primary Care & Outcomes Res, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Harris, Alex H.

Thus, a relatively new discipline called neuroergonomics is holding the promise of studying the neural mechanisms underlying human performance in pursuit of both theoretical and practical insights. In this work, we utilized a neuroergonomic approach by combining insights from ecological psychology and embodied cognition to study flight expertise. Specifically, we focused on the Mirror Neuron system as a key correlate for understanding the interaction between an individual and the environment, suggesting that it can be used to index changes in the coupling of perception-action associated with skill development. In this study, we measured the EEG mu suppression as a proxy of the Mirror Neuron system in experts (pilots) and novices while performing a distance estimation task in a landing scenario. To survey the specificity of this measure, we considered central, parietal and occipital electrode pools and analyzed alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (18-25 Hz) rhythm bands. We hypothesized that in experts vs. novices, specific neural sensorimotor brain activity would underpin the connection between perception and action in an in-flight context. Preliminary results indicate that alpha and beta rhythm suppression was area-specific irrespective of groups, present in the central electrodes placed over the motor areas. Group analysis revealed that specifically alpha mu rhythm, but not beta, was significantly more suppressed in pilots vs. novices. Complementing these findings we found a trend in which the strength of mu suppression increased with the sense of presence experienced by the pilots. Such sensorimotor activation is in line with the idea that for a pilot, a distance judgment is intimately associated with the function of landing. This reflects the ability to use optical invariants to see the world in terms of the capabilities of the aircraft (e.g., reachability and glide angle). These preliminary findings support the role of embodied simulation mechanisms in visual perception and add important insights into a practical understanding of flight expertise, suggesting sensorimotor mechanisms as potential neuro-markers.;"[Sestito, Mariateresa; Harel, Assaf; Nador, Jeff; Flach, John] Wright State Univ, Dept Psychol, Dayton, OH 45435 USA";Sestito, M (corresponding author), Wright State Univ, Dept Psychol, Dayton, OH 45435 USA.;m.sestito5869a@ordpsicologier.it;;sestito, mariateresa/0000-0002-7045-6850;;;;84;7;7;0;6;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;1662-5161;;;FRONT HUM NEUROSCI;Front.

This is extremely important to minimize risk and ensure safe operation of complex systems. Over six decades of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA's) efforts in aviation and human spaceflight, the highly trained individuals from each discipline who have worked collectively to accomplish our spaceflight programs must embrace human systems integration (HSI) with different skill sets, terminology, and approaches. The Rosetta Stone, which enabled translation of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, represents an appropriate analogy for communication necessary between these three distinct disciplines. A group of subject matter experts was assembled to write a text to be used within Aerospace HSI to ensure effective dialogue between engineers, life scientists, and health/medicine experts. A 10-chapter NASA special publication was produced. Each chapter provided a cogent discourse on various aspects of the subject. A series of recommendations were also developed and reported here. As a community, we are embarking on new exploration initiatives. The human will serve as a constant and essential element in the construct of systems to support these missions. Each discipline must work closely together from the beginning of the design phase to ensure HSI is successfully accomplished and the programmatic expectations and goals are safely met.;"[Doarn, Charles R.] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Dept Family & Community Med, 231 Albert Sabin Way,Med Sci Bldg MSB,Room 4453B, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA; [Doarn, Charles R.; Weyland, Mark; Shepanek, Marc; Liskowsky, David] NASA Headquarters, Off Chief Hlth & Med Officer, Washington, DC USA; [Travis, Thomas W.] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, San Antonio, TX USA; [Currie-Gregg, Nancy K.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, College Stn, TX USA; [Nicogossian, Arnauld E.] George Mason Univ, Schar Sch Policy & Govt, Arlington, VA USA; [Null, Cynthia] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Engn & Safety Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Buckland, Daniel M.] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC USA; [Miller, Sarah B.] Duke Univ, Div Emergency Med, Durham, NC USA; [Miller, Sarah B.] Duke Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Durham, NC USA; [Fuller, David] NASA, Glenn Res Ctr, Safety Ctr, Cleveland, OH USA; [Francisco, David] NASA, Johnson Space Ctr, Human Syst Risk Management, Houston, TX USA; [Walton, Marlei] Technol & Engn Grp, Adv Technol Engn & Med, Houston, TX USA; [Antonsen, Erik] NASA, Johnson Space Ctr, Houston, TX USA; [Antonsen, Erik] Baylor Coll Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Rochlis, Jennifer] NASA, Johnson Space Ctr, Human Syst Engn & Dev Div, Houston, TX USA; [Witt, Elton G.] NASA, Johnson Space Ctr, Leidos Inc, Explorat & Mission Support,Civil Grp, Houston, TX USA; [Williams, Richard S.] Virginia Dept Hlth, Richmond, VA USA";Doarn, CR (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Dept Family & Community Med, 231 Albert Sabin Way,Med Sci Bldg MSB,Room 4453B, Cincinnati, OH 45267 USA.;charles.doarn@uc.edu;Buckland, Daniel/S-1266-2019;Buckland, Daniel/0000-0001-5274-3840;;;;13;0;0;0;2;MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC;NEW ROCHELLE;140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA;2168-0256;2168-0264;;NEW SPACE;New Space;JUN 1;2019;7;2;;;;;110;113;;10.1089/space.2018.0029;;DEC 2018;4;Engineering, Aerospace;Engineering;IC3RV;WOS:000452995400001;;Bronze;;;2021-02-18;

Spectral matching to databases of authentic compounds are the preferred tools for metabolite identifications; however, the metabolic coverage of these databases is still limited compared to the number of known metabolites. Several computational tools have been developed to facilitate the interpretation of MS data but unfortunately most of them have limited applicability to GCMS-based metabolite identification. In this paper, we introduce a computer-aided, metabolite expert system called MetExpert which emulates the metabolite-identification ability of a human expert using orthogonal datasets including molecular formulas, retention indices, and EI-MS spectra to characterize the molecular structures. This system integrates four modules including in silico derivatization, metabolite-likeness evaluation, retention prediction, and substructure prediction. In silico derivatization increases the searchable chemical space for TMS-derivatized metabolites many of which are absent in molecular structure databases. Metabolite-likeness evaluations are an efficient approach to select metabolite-like molecules when querying large databases such as PubChem. An artificial neutral network then establishes the quantitative structure. retention relationships for the accurate prediction of RIs that further refines the candidate molecules. In addition, PLS-DA models establish quantitative structure. spectra relationships for the prediction of metabolite substructures. Finally, weighted scoring of three orthogonal evaluations increases the identification rates. MetExpert outperformed current state-of-the-art methods such as MetFrag and CFM-ID for ranking the correct identifications. While spectral comparisons with chemical standards or de novo structural elucidations are necessary to validate the predictions, MetExpert provides an efficient and effective approach to prioritize the candidates.

In order to gain a deeper understanding of the opinions of potential future users regarding the new technology, we have analyzed the answers of two large groups of anesthetists using two different study methods.MethodsFirst, we carried out a qualitative analysis guided by the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research checklist. For this analysis, we interviewed 128 anesthesiologists, asking: Where do you see advantages in Visual Patient monitoring? and afterward identified major and minor themes in their answers. In a second study, an online survey with 38 anesthesiologists at two different institutions, we added a quantitative part in which anesthesiologists rated statements based on the themes identified in the prior analysis on an ordinal rating scale.ResultsWe identified four high-level themes: quick situation recognition, intuitiveness, unique design characteristics, and potential future uses, and eight subthemes.The quantitative questions raised for each major theme were: 1. The Visual Patient technology enabled me to get a quick overview of the situation. (63% of the participants agreed or very much agreed to this statement). 2. I found the Visual Patient technology to be intuitive and easy to learn. (82% agreed or very much agreed to this statement). 3. The visual design features of the Visual Patient technology (e.g., the avatar representation) are not helpful for patient monitoring. (11% agreed to this statement). 4. I think the Visual Patient technology might be helpful for non-monitor experts (e.g., surgeons) in the healthcare system. (53% of the participants agreed or strongly agreed).ConclusionThis mixed method study provides evidence that the included anesthesiologists considered the new avatar-based technology to be intuitive and easy to learn and that the technology enabled them to get an overview of the situation quickly.

While electroencephalography (EEG) plays important roles in monitoring the brain activity of patients with epilepsy and diagnosing epilepsy, an expert is needed to analyze all EEG recordings to detect epileptic activity. This method is obviously time-consuming and tedious, and a timely and accurate diagnosis of epilepsy is essential to initiate antiepileptic drug therapy and subsequently reduce the risk of future seizures and seizure-related complications. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on raw EEG signals instead of manual feature extraction was used to distinguish ictal, preictal, and interictal segments for epileptic seizure detection. We compared the performances of time and frequency domain signals in the detection of epileptic signals based on the intracranial Freiburg and scalp CHB-MIT databases to explore the potential of these parameters. Three types of experiments involving two binary classification problems (interictal vs. preictal and interictal vs. ictal) and one three-class problem (interictal vs. preictal vs. ictal) were conducted to explore the feasibility of this method. Using frequency domain signals in the Freiburg database, average accuracies of 96.7, 95.4, and 92.3% were obtained for the three experiments, while the average accuracies for detection in the CHB-MIT database were 95.6, 97.5, and 93% in the three experiments. Using time domain signals in the Freiburg database, the average accuracies were 91.1, 83.8, and 85.1% in the three experiments, while the signal detection accuracies in the CHB-MIT database were only 59.5, 62.3, and 47.9% in the three experiments. Based on these results, the three cases are effectively detected using frequency domain signals. However, the effective identification of the three cases using time domain signals as input samples is achieved for only some patients. Overall, the classification accuracies of frequency domain signals are significantly increased compared to time domain signals. In addition, frequency domain signals have greater potential than time domain signals for CNN applications.;"[Zhou, Mengni; Tian, Cheng; Wang, Bin; Niu, Yan; Hu, Ting; Guo, Hao; Xiang, Jie] Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Informat & Comp Sci, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Cao, Rui] Taiyuan Univ Technol, Software Coll, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China";Xiang, J (corresponding author), Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Informat & Comp Sci, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China.;xiangjie@tyut.edu.cn;guo, hao/AAE-1608-2019;guo, hao/0000-0002-3463-5739;"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61503272, 61305142, 61741212, 61373101]; Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province [2015021090, 201601D202042]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M601287]; Shanxi Provincial Foundation for Returned Scholars, China [2016-037]";We would like to thank the Epilepsy Center of the University Hospital of Freiburg, Germany and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, USA) to make the database available.

Design/methodology/approach The study consists of a systematic quantitative literature review of academic articles indexed on the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The articles were reviewed based on the following features: research topic; conceptual and theoretical characterization; sources of data; type of data and size; data collection methods; data analysis techniques; and data reporting and visualization. Findings Findings indicate an increase in hospitality and tourism management literature applying analytical techniques to large quantities of data. However, this research field is fairly fragmented in scope and limited in methodologies and displays several gaps. A conceptual framework that helps to identify critical business problems and links the domains of business intelligence and big data to tourism and hospitality management and development is missing. Moreover, epistemological dilemmas and consequences for theory development of big data-driven knowledge are still a terra incognita. Last, despite calls for more integration of management and data science, cross-disciplinary collaborations with computer and data scientists are rather episodic and related to specific types of work and research. Research limitations/implications This work is based on academic articles published before 2017; hence, scientific outputs published after the moment of writing have not been included.

They are required for buildings to positively adjust themselves to local climates in different climate regions. Incorrect selections of these technologies may cause resource waste and low technological efficiency. Therefore, the present study to explore the regional suitability of climate responsive technologies was conducted with expert knowledge-based investigation in five kinds of climate regions in China, including severe cold region, cold region, hot summer & cold winter region, hot summer & warm winter region and temperate region. 71 climate-responsive technologies were identified for controlling climate physical features (i.e., temperature, humidity, sunlight, and ventilation). Suitability priorities as well as application levels were analyzed with expert knowledge-based rankings, based on which, a database of climate-responsive technologies for buildings in different climate regions was established. The most suitable general technologies in different climate regions were derived regarding temperature, humidity, sunlight, and ventilation. The findings illustrated universality and disparity of technology regional suitability and those with high suitability rankings are well-responded to different climate regions. The study provides guidance for selecting climate-responsive technologies according to their regional suitability. It promotes wide application of appropriate technologies in different climates and contributes to the formation of healthy climate-responsive buildings with highly suitable climate-responsive technologies.

Electronic-prescribing and smart-pump technology are examples of HIT medication error reduction strategies. The introduction of new errors on HIT implementation is, however, also recognised. To determine the impact of HIT interventions, clear medication error definitions are required. This study aims to achieve consensus on defining as medication errors a range of either technology-generated, or previously unaddressed infusion-related scenarios, common in the paediatric intensive care setting.MethodsThis study was conducted in a 23-bed paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of an Irish tertiary paediatric hospital. A modified Delphi technique was employed: previously undefined medication-incidents were identified by retrospective review of voluntary incident reports and clinical pharmacist interventions; a multidisciplinary expert panel scored each incident using a 9-point Likert scale over a number of iterative rounds; levels of agreement were assessed to produce a list of medication errors. Differences in scoring between healthcare professionals were assessed.ResultsSeventeen potential errors or scenarios' requiring consensus were identified, 13 of which related to technology recently implemented into the PICU. These were presented to a panel of 37 participants, comprising of doctors, nurses and pharmacists. Consensus was reached to define as errors all reported smart-pump scenarios (n=6) and those pertaining to the pre-electronic process of prescribing weight-based paediatric infusions (n =4). Of 7 electronic-prescribing scenarios, 4 were defined as errors, 2 were deemed not to be and consensus could not be achieved for the last. Some differences in scoring between healthcare professionals were found, but were only significant (p <0.05) for two and three scenarios in consensus rounds 1 and 2 respectively.ConclusionThe list of medication errors produced using the Delphi technique highlights the diversity of previously undefined medication errors in PICU. The increased complexity of electronic-prescribing processes is evident from the difficulty in achieving consensus on those scenarios. Reducing ambiguity in defining medication errors should assist future research on the impact of HIT medication safety initiatives in critical care. The increasing use of HIT and associated new errors will necessitate further similar studies.";"[Howlett, Moninne M.; Breatnach, Cormac V.] Our Ladys Childrens Hosp, Dublin 12, Ireland; [Howlett, Moninne M.; Cleary, Brian J.] Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Sch Pharm, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Howlett, Moninne M.] Natl Childrens Res Ctr, Dublin 12, Ireland; [Cleary, Brian J.] Rotunda Hosp, Dublin 1, Ireland";"Howlett, MM (corresponding author), Our Ladys Childrens Hosp, Dublin 12, Ireland.; Howlett, MM (corresponding author), Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Sch Pharm, Dublin 2, Ireland.";moninnehowlett@gmail.com;Howlett, Moninne/P-7245-2019;"Howlett, Moninne/0000-0002-5798-6240; Breatnach, Cormac V/0000-0002-5871-3236";National Children's Research Centre, Crumlin;MH was funded by the National Children's Research Centre, Crumlin to conduct this study as part of a PhD fellowship grant.

Current patient fall reporting systems remain in the early stage that is far away from reaching the ultimate goal toward a safer healthcare. According to the Kirkpatrick model, the key challenge in reaction, learning, behavior and results is the realization of learning stage due to the lack of knowledge management, sharing and growing mechanism.MethodsBased on the key contributing factors defined by AHRQ Common Formats 2.0, a hierarchical list of contributing factors for patient falls was established by expert review and discussion. Using the list as an infrastructure, we designed and developed a novel reporting system, where a strategy to identify contributing factors is intended to provide reporters knowledge support, in the form of similar cases and potential solutions. A survey containing two scenarios was conducted to evaluate the learning effect of our system.ResultsIn both scenarios, potential solutionsrecommendedby the system were annotated with correct contributing factors, and presented only when the corresponding factors were identified from the query report or selected by the user. The five experts show substantial consistency (Fleiss' kappa >0.6) and high agreement (rangingbetween fully agree and mostly agree)in the assessment of the three perspectives of the system, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge support toward sharing andlearningthrough the novel reporting system.ConclusionsThis study proposeda profile of contributing factors thatcould measure the similarity of patient safety events. Based on the profile, a knowledge-based reporting and learning system was developed to bridge the gap between surveillance, reporting, and retrospective analysis in the fall management circle. The system holds promise in improving event reporting toward better and safer healthcare.;"[Kang, Hong; Zhou, Sicheng; Yao, Bin; Gong, Yang] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Biomed Informat, 7000 Fannin St, Houston, TX 77030 USA";Gong, Y (corresponding author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Biomed Informat, 7000 Fannin St, Houston, TX 77030 USA.;Yang.Gong@uth.tmc.edu;;;"UTHealth Innovation for Cancer Prevention Research Training Program Post-Doctoral Fellow-ship (Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas) [RP160015]; Agency for Healthcare Research and QualityUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality [1R01HS022895]; University of Texas System Grants Program [156374]; AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITYUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality [R01HS022895, R01HS022895, R01HS022895] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";This project is supported by UTHealth Innovation for Cancer Prevention Research Training Program Post-Doctoral Fellow-ship (Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas grant #RP160015), The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (1R01HS022895), and The University of Texas System Grants Program (#156374).

However, current detection approaches mainly rely on limited features manually designed by domain experts, which are inflexible for the detection of a variety of patterns in a large amount of patients' EEG data. Moreover, conventional machine learning algorithms for seizure detection cannot accommodate multi-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) data effectively, which contains both temporal and spatial information. Recently, deep learning technology has been widely applied to perform image processing tasks, which could learns useful features from data and process multi-channel data automatically. To provide an effective system for automatic seizure detection, we proposed a new three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, whose inputs are multi-channel EEG signals.MethodsEEG data of 13 patients were collected from one center hospital, which has already been inspected by experts. To represent EEG data in CNN, firstly time series of each channel of EEG data was converted into the two-dimensional image. Then all channel images were combined into 3D images according to the mutual correlation intensity between different electrodes. Finally, a CNN was constructed using 3D kernels to predict different stages of EEG data, including inter-ictal, pre-ictal, and ictal stages. The system performance was evaluated and compared with the traditional feature-based classifier and the two-dimensional (2D) deep learning method.ResultsIt demonstrated that multi-channel EEG data could provide more information for increasing the specificity and sensitivity in cpmparison result between the single and multi-channel. And the 3D CNN based on multi-channel outperformed the 2D CNN and traditional signal processing methods with an accuracy of more than 90%, an sensitivity of 88.90% and an specificity of 93.78%.ConclusionsThis is the first effort to apply 3D CNN in detecting seizures from EEG. It provides a new way of learning patterns simultaneously from multi-channel EEG signals, and demonstrates that deep neural networks in combination with 3D kernels can establish an effective system for seizure detection.;"[Wei, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Liangjun; Zhou, Yi] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Zhongshan Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Lin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Software Engn, Sch Comp & Data Sci, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ziyi] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Neurol, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China";Zhou, Y (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Zhongshan Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;"weixy35@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; zhouyi@mail.sysu.edu.cn";;;"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61876194]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC0116902, 2018YFC0116904, 2016YFC0901602]; NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1611261]; Guangdong Science Center for Big Data [U1611261]; Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou [201604020016]; Science and Technology Program of Huizhou [2014B010118003]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong ProvinceNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2018A030313345]";This research/work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [No. 61876194], The National Key Research and Development Program of China [No. 2018YFC0116902, No. 2018YFC0116904, No. 2016YFC0901602], Joint Foundation for the NSFC and Guangdong Science Center for Big Data (No. U1611261], Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou [No. 201604020016], Science and Technology Program of Huizhou [No. 2014B010118003] and Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [No. 2018A030313345].

Analyzing and learning from the medication event reports is an important way to prevent the recurrence of these events. Currently, the analysis of medication event reports is ineffective and requires heavy workloads for clinicians. An automated pipelineis proposed to help clinicians deal with the accumulated reports, extract valuable information and generate feedback from the reports. Thus, the strategy of medication event prevention can be further developed based on the lessons learned.MethodsIn order to build the automated pipeline, four classic machine learning classifiers (i.e., support vector machine, Naive Bayes, random forest, and multi-layer perceptron) were compared to identify the event originating stages, event types, and event causes from the medication event reports. The precision, recall and F-1 measure were calculated to assess theperformance of the classifiers. Further, a strategy to measure the similarity of medication event reports in our pipeline was established andevaluated by human subjects through a questionnaire.ResultsWe developed three classifiers to identify the medication event originating stages, event types and causes, respectively. For theevent originating stages, a support vector machine classifier obtains the best performance with anF-1 measure of 0.792. For theevent types, a support vector machine classifier exhibitsthe best performance withan F-1 measure of 0.758. And for theevent causes, a random forest classifier reaches an F-1 measure of 0.925. The questionnaireresults show that the similarity measurement is consistent with the domain experts in the task of identifying similar reports.ConclusionWe developed and evaluated an automated pipeline that could identify three attributes from the medication event reports and calculate the similarity scores between the reports based on the attributes. The pipeline is expected to improve the efficiency of analyzing the medication event reports and to learn from the reports in a timely manner.;"[Zhou, Sicheng; Kang, Hong; Yao, Bin; Gong, Yang] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Biomed Informat, 7000 Fannin St,Suite 600, Houston, TX 77030 USA";Gong, Y (corresponding author), Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Biomed Informat, 7000 Fannin St,Suite 600, Houston, TX 77030 USA.;Yang.Gong@uth.tmc.edu;;;"Agency for Healthcare Research QualityUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality [1R01HS022895]; UTHealth Innovation for Cancer Prevention Research Training Program Post-doctoral Fellowship (Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas) [RP160015]; AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITYUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality [R01HS022895] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";This project is supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality (1R01HS022895) and UTHealth Innovation for Cancer Prevention Research Training Program Post-doctoral Fellowship (Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas grant #RP160015).

Although European guidelines overlap, presumably, there is large diversity in their practical use and in the actual health care situation. The aim of this qualitative evaluation was to compare health care for PSS across 9 European countries, to illustrate commonalities and differences, and to discuss challenges for a pan-European research agenda. Methods: A case vignette fulfilling ICD-10 criteria of undifferentiated somatization disorder was presented to 24 experts from 9 European countries, who completed a semi-structured assessment regarding the routine management including diagnostic procedures, treatment recommendations, and country-specific health care aspects. A qualitative evaluation was conducted using the video-transcripts of the presentations. Results were validated by additional expert interviews. Results: Across all countries, primary care physicians serve as the gate keeper for further diagnostic and treatment procedures. Apart from this commonality, there is a large variability in health care routines. Experts concluded that individuals with PSS appear to be a non-identified patient group within many European health care systems. To overcome the gap between evidence-based guidelines and clinical reality needs, three key challenges were identified: (1) Defining a clinically useful, acceptable, and non-stigmatizing diagnostic term, (2) implementing guideline recommendations into routine care, (3) developing effective dissemination strategies. Conclusions: The results advocate for more research on the actual European health care situation. A systematic European research agenda with unified goals and interdisciplinary collaboration that integrates all stakeholders could answer this challenge.;"[Kohlmann, Sebastian; Loewe, Bernd; Shedden-Mora, Meike C.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Psychosomat Med & Psychotherapy, Hamburg, Germany";Kohlmann, S (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Psychosomat Med & Psychotherapy, Hamburg, Germany.;s.kohlmann@uke.de;Lowe, Bernd/AAG-4038-2020;;Hamburg Authority for Science, Research and Gender Equality (Hamburg, Germany);The initial two EURONET-SOMA meetings in Hamburg 2016 were funded by a research networking grant from the Hamburg Authority for Science, Research and Gender Equality (Hamburg, Germany) to Bernd Lowe et al., University Medical Center, Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.

Toward the limits of existence of nuclear structure;PHYSICAL REVIEW C;;;English;Article;;;;;;;SHELL;Prospects of experimental studies of argon and chlorine isotopes located far beyond the proton dripline are studied by using systematics and cluster models. The deviations from the widespread systematics observed in Cl-28,Cl-29 and Ar-29,Ar-30 have been theoretically substantiated, and analogous deviations have been predicted for the lighter chlorine and argon isotopes. The limits of nuclear structure existence are predicted for Ar and Cl isotopic chains, with Ar-26 and Cl-25 found to be the lightest sufficiently long-living nuclear systems. By simultaneous measurements of protons and gamma rays following decays of such systems as well as their beta-delayed emission, an interesting synergy effect may be achieved, which is demonstrated by the example of Cl-30 and Ar-31 ground-state studies. Such a synergy effect may be provided by the new EXPERT setup (EXotic Particle Emission and Radioactivity by Tracking) being operated inside the fragment separator and spectrometer facility at GSI, Darmstadt.;"[Grigorenko, L., V; Chudoba, V; Fomichev, A.; Gorshkov, A.; Kaminski, G.; Krupko, S.; Nikolskii, E.

This study aimed to develop specific goals and performance indicators to establish a system to guarantee right to health and access to medical service for PWDs. The first procedure was the establishment of the performance indicators, and the second was the content validity verification of the established performance indicators. To establish the performance indicators, we used the policy indicators of the government to improve the health of the Korean people. The indicators that needed to be newly developed were established based on literature review and expert consultation. Three Delphi surveys were conducted to verify the content validity of the established performance indicators. The content validity index (CVI) was obtained for the importance and possibility of the performance indicators. The indicators using the existing policy indicators are proportion of public health centers and rate of health checkup of PWDs, and newly developed indicators are establishment of facilities for PWDs in health care facilities (buildings and personnel) and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in early childhood (average age and awareness). The final performance indicators consist of a total of six areas, 22 sub-areas, and 40 individual indicators. The final performance indicators in this study can be used as basic data for continuously identifying the health status of PWDs in Korea and establishing the national policy for their health promotion. This study is also expected to serve as a framework to guarantee the right to health and access to medical service for PWDs rather than simply containing declarative content.;"[Lee, Bomyee; Park, So-Youn] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Med Educ & Med Humanities, Sch Med, Seoul, South Korea";Park, SY (corresponding author), Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Med Educ & Med Humanities, Sch Med, Seoul, South Korea.;syparkmd@khu.ac.kr;;;Korean National Rehabilitation Center Research Institute, Ministry of Health and Welfare [2017008];This research was supported by the R&D grant (No. 2017008) on rehabilitation by the Korean National Rehabilitation Center Research Institute, Ministry of Health and Welfare.

Expert consensus is that suicide prevention strategies should be culturally sensitive and specific to particular populations and socio-cultural and economic contexts. The aim of this study was to explore mental health care providers' context- and population-specific suggestions for suicide prevention when providing services for PWSUDs in the Western Cape, South Africa.MethodsQualitative data were collected via in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 18 mental health care providers providing services to PWSUDs in the public and private health care sectors of the Western Cape, South Africa. Data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis.ResultsParticipants highlighted the importance of providing effective mental health care, transforming the mental health care system, community interventions, and early intervention, in order to prevent suicide amongst PWSUDs. Many of their suggestions reflected basic principles of effective mental health care provision. However, participants also suggested further training in suicide prevention for mental health care providers, optimising the use of existing health care resources, expanding service provision for suicidal PWSUDs, improving policies and regulations for the treatment of substance use disorders, provision of integrated health care, and focusing on early intervention to prevent suicide.ConclusionsTraining mental health care providers in suicide prevention must be augmented by addressing systemic problems in the provision of mental health care and contextual problems that make suicide prevention challenging. Many of the suggestions offered by these participants depart from individualist, biomedical approaches to suicide prevention to include a more contextual view of suicide prevention. A re-thinking of traditional bio-medical approaches to suicide prevention may be warranted in order to reduce suicide among PWSUDs.;"[Goldstone, Daniel; Bantjes, Jason] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Psychol, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Dannatt, Lisa] Groote Schuur Hosp, Dept Psychiat & Mental Hlth, J Block, Cape Town, South Africa";Goldstone, D (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Psychol, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa.;dgdanielgoldie@gmail.com;Bantjes, Jason/T-8294-2019;Bantjes, Jason/0000-0002-3626-9883;"NRF [SFH150722129394]; NIAAAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [5R24AA022919-04]; Stellenbosch University Merit Bursary; MRC Career Development AwardUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC); NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R24AA022919, R24AA022919, R24AA022919] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";This research was funded by a NRF Innovation Scholarship (SFH150722129394) (DG), a NIAAA Research Grant (5R24AA022919-04) awarded to the Partnership for Alcohol and AIDS Intervention Research (PAAIR) (DG), a Stellenbosch University Merit Bursary (DG), and a MRC Career Development Award (JB).

Design/methodology/approach First, based on a literature review of the historical roots of regenerative design and related approaches and the interviews held with experts of the related field, the paper proposes a structured framework of architectural indicators suitable for the context of Tehran. Later, the importance of criteria is estimated by the analytic hierarchy process method based on a survey of experts. Finally, the results clarify the order of indicators' importance for enhancing research-educational buildings with the aim of developing regenerative design in the context. Findings The rankings revealed that, in the environmental dimension, Design of site & building and Site & context considerations are the top priorities of learning spaces in Tehran followed by Water management, Energy management and Materials & waste management ranked as less significant, but still important indicators. In the social dimension, Design for people & human health was considered much more important than Social interaction and Interaction with nature, and in the cultural dimension, vernacular & historical features of design was more important than Aesthetic feature. In the economic dimension, Energy storage & production indicator was ranked highest followed by Adaptability & multiplicity of design solutions and Using waste to produce new resources. Generally, for achieving regenerative architecture in learning spaces, the environmental criterion was given the highest weight among all dimensions. After that, the higher rank was given to social dimension; while cultural and economic dimensions took the third and fourth place. Research limitations/implications - The paper has limitations because of the limited number of experts in the field of regenerative approach. Originality/value This research seeks to answer the following question: what is the ranking of regenerative architecture indicators in the design of research-educational building projects in the context of Tehran? To answer this question, the indicators of regenerative design in the architectural field are explored through a detailed study of literature and interview with experts of the related field; later, they are ranked based on a survey approach that investigates the opinions of experts. The final results are then explained based on logical analysis to obtain a comprehensive understanding. The prioritization of indicators actually provides a simple framework for designers and architects to have a clear path in developing an architectural regenerative project when different contexts vary in influential features. The selection and prioritization of indicators in this research depended mainly on their relevance to the conditions of Tehran and can be used for regions with similar conditions as well.";"[Bonyad, Roya] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture & Urban Design, Tehran, Iran; [Hamzenejad, Mahdi; Khanmohammadi, Mohammadali] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Tehran, Iran";Bonyad, R (corresponding author), Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture & Urban Design, Tehran, Iran.;"bonyadroya@gmail.com; hamzenejad@iust.ac.ir; Khanmohammadi@iust.ac.ir";;;;;;16;2;2;1;1;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2046-6099;2046-6102;;SMART SUSTAIN BUILT;Smart Sustain.

The main objective of the proposed approach is the use only one global model to represent all the distinct dynamics resulting from the switching behaviour of the system. Compared with classical approaches such as the hybrid automata, the Operating Mode Management (OMM) is more effective due to the separation between the continuous dynamics, represented by the BG continuous state, and the discrete state governed by a classical automaton. The innovative interest in this work is that it allows for a non-expert user to perform modelling without expressing the algebraic equations of the system and regardless of its hybrid aspect. The modelling approach is applied to Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRES) represented by a multi-sources system which composed of Solar Photovoltaic Panels (PV) and Wind Turbine (WT) coupled with an EL to produce green hydrogen stored and when needed feeding a Fuel Cell (FC). A reduced size experimental HRES is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Early diagnosis can reduce or prevent the progression of renal damage. The present study introduces an expert medical decision support system (MDSS) based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to predict the timeframe of renal failure. Methods: The core system of the MDSS is a Takagi-Sugeno type ANFIS model that predicts the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values as the biological marker of the renal failure. The model uses 10-year clinical records of newly diagnosed CKD patients and considers the threshold value of 15 cc/kg/min/1.73 m(2) of GFR as the marker of renal failure. Following the evaluation of 10 variables, the ANFIS model uses the weight, diastolic blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus as underlying disease, and current GFR((t) )as the inputs of the predicting model to predict the GFR values at future intervals. Then, a user-friendly graphical user interface of the model was built in MATLAB, in which the user can enter the physiological parameters obtained from patient recordings to determine the renal failure time as the output. Results: Assessing the performance of the MDSS against the real data of male and female CKD patients showed that this decision support model could accurately estimate GFR variations in all sequential periods of 6, 12, and 18 months, with a normalized mean absolute error lower than 5%. Despite the high uncertainties of the human body and the dynamic nature of CKD progression, our model can accurately predict the GFR variations at long future periods. Conclusions: The MDSS GUI could be useful in medical centers and used by experts to predict renal failure progression and, through taking effective actions, CKD can be prevented or effectively delayed.;"[Yadollahpour, Ali] Ahvaz Jundishapur Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Med Phys, Ahwaz, Iran; [Nourozi, Jamshid] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Environm & Energy, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran; [Mirbagheri, Seyed Ahmad] KN Toosi Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Simancas-Acevedo, Eric] Polytech Univ Pachuca, Telemat Engn Dept, Zempoala, Mexico; [Trejo-Macotela, Francisco R.] Polytech Univ Pachuca, Grad & Res Dept, Zempoala, Mexico";Yadollahpour, A (corresponding author), Ahvaz Jundishapur Univ Med Sci, Sch Med, Dept Med Phys, Ahwaz, Iran.;yadollahpour.a@gmail.com;"Trejo-Macotela, Francisco Rafael/T-3684-2018; yadollahpour, ali/K-9098-2015";"Trejo-Macotela, Francisco Rafael/0000-0003-2133-3456; yadollahpour, ali/0000-0002-1216-2109";Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IranTehran University of Medical Sciences [18325];This research was funded by Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran [Grant No.: 18325].;;39;3;3;0;7;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;1664-042X;;;FRONT PHYSIOL;Front.

In research applications, these classifications require the experimenter to be blinded to the treatment group in order to avoid unintentional bias in scoring. Currently, many labs either use laborious and tedious methods to manually blind the images, require multiple experimenters to gather and score the data blindly or fail to properly blind the data altogether. In this protocol, we present a simple, freely available software that we created that allows the experimenter to blindly score images. In our protocol, the user loads unblinded images and defines a scoring system. The software then shows the user the images in a random order, allowing the user to select a score from their defined scoring system for each image. Furthermore, the software has an optional quality control mechanism where the user will be shown some images multiple times to test the robustness of the visual scoring. Finally, the software summarizes the results in an exportable file that includes unblinded summary data for each group and a full list of images with their scores. In this protocol, we briefly present directions for using the software, potential applications, and caveats/limitations to this approach.;"[Cothren, Steven D.] Solibyte Solut, Durham, NC USA; [Meyer, Joel N.; Hartmann, Jessica H.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA";Hartmann, JH (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;jessica.h.hartman@duke.edu;Meyer, Joel/G-9836-2017;Meyer, Joel/0000-0003-1219-0983;"NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs [P40 OD010440]; NIEHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [F32ES027306, R01ES028218, P42ES010356]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, R01ES028218, P42ES010356, F32ES027306, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, F32ES027306, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, R01ES028218, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, F32ES027306, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, P42ES010356, F32ES027306, P42ES010356, R01ES028218, P42ES010356] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";The authors would like to gratefully acknowledge the input and suggestions of Melissa Chernick (Duke University, Durham, NC) and Ricardo Laranjeiro (Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ) from beta testing previous versions of the software.

Study Selection: The primary references were Chinese and English articles including (a) original guidelines and expert consensuses of primary glaucoma, (b) reviews focusing on the differences between various versions of these guidelines and consensuses, and (c) papers about ocular-cranial pressure gradient theory and the relationship between glaucoma and CNS degenerative diseases. Results: The definitions and classifications of both primary open-angle glaucoma and primary angle-closure glaucoma differ between Chinese glaucoma consensuses and international primary glaucoma guidelines. Chinese definitions and classifications put more emphasis on the IOP, while international guidelines put more emphasis on the presence of optic neuropathy. The ocular-cranial pressure gradient theory and the research on the relationship between glaucoma and CNS degenerative diseases have provided new directions for exploring the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Conclusions: As regards the definition and classification of primary glaucoma, we find that there are still some discrepancies between Chinese expert consensuses and international guidelines. Glaucoma is a disease with complex etiologies, while its common characteristic is a specific optic neuropathy. The current definition and understanding of glaucoma is an ongoing and evolving process, reflecting our latest available evidence on its pathogenesis. Chinese ophthalmology community may need to update our guidelines, accommodating these latest developments.;"[Liu, Si-An; Zhao, Zhen-Ni; Sun, Nan-Nan; Fan, Zhi-Gang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Zhongshan Ophthalm Ctr, State Key Lab Ophthalmol, Dept Glaucoma, Guangzhou 510060, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Han, Ying; Chen, Jeremy] Univ Calif San Francisco, UCSF Med Ctr, Dept Ophthalmol, San Francisco, CA 94010 USA";Fan, ZG (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Zhongshan Ophthalm Ctr, State Key Lab Ophthalmol, Dept Glaucoma, Guangzhou 510060, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;fanzhg3@mail.sysu.edu.cn;;;;;;59;4;5;0;4;LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS;PHILADELPHIA;TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA;0366-6999;2542-5641;;CHINESE MED J-PEKING;Chin.

Evolution of technology allows collection of increasingly larger and more specific data sets related to sport activities in cost-effective and accessible manner. All this information is minutely scrutinized by thousands of analysts around the globe in search of answers that can in the long-term help increase the performance of individuals or teams in their respective competitions. As the volume of data increases in size, so does the complexity of the problem and the need for suitable tools that leverage the cognitive load involved in the investigation. It is proven that visualization and computer-vision techniques, correctly applied to the context of a problem, help data analysts focus on the relevant information at each stage of the process, and generally lead to a better understanding of the facts that lie behind the data. In the current study, we presented a software prototype capable of assisting researchers and performance analysts in their duty of studying group collective behavior in soccer games and trainings. We used geospatial data acquired from a professional match to demonstrate its capabilities in two different case studies.

In limited resource countries like Tanzania, there is scarce data describing the basic knowledge of CPR among Healthcare providers (HCP). This study aimed to determine the current level of knowledge on, and ability to perform, CPR among HCP at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH).MethodsThis was a descriptive cross sectional study of a random sample of 350 HCP from all cadres and departments at MNH from October 2015 to March 2016. Each participant completed a with 25 question multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank CPR test and a practical test using a CPR manikin where the participant was videotaped for 1-2min. Two expert observers independently viewed the videos and rated participant performance on a structured data form. The primary outcome of interest was staff member overall performance on the written and practical CPR testing.ResultsWe enrolled 350 HCPs from all 12 MNH clinical departments. The median participant age was 35 (IQR 29-43) years, 225 (64%) were female and 138 (39%) had clinical experience of less than 5years. Only 57 (16%) and 88 (25%) scored above 50% in written and practical tests, respectively according to local minimum passing test score and 13(4%) and 30 (9%) scored above 75% in written and practical tests, respectively according to international minimum passing test score on CPR. The 233(67%) HCP who reported prior experience performing CPR on an adult patient scored higher on testing than those without; 40% (IQR 28-54) versus 26% (IQR 16-42) respectively, but both groups had median scores <50%.ConclusionThe level of CPR knowledge and skills displayed by all cadres and in all departments was poor despite the fact that most providers reported having performed CPR in the past. Since MNH is a tertiary referral hospital, it may reflect the performance of resuscitation status of other local health centers in Tanzania and other low-income countries to employ a formal system of training every HCP in CPR.

To design, plan, and manage transportation networks, domain experts need data that reflect how people move from one place to another, at what times, for what purpose, and in what mode(s) of transportation. However, traditional data collection methods are not cost-effective or timely. For instance, travel surveys are very expensive, collected every ten years, a period of time that does not cope with quick city changes, and using a relatively small sample of people. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic pipeline to infer the distribution of mode of transportation usage in a city, using mobile phone network data. Our pipeline is based on a Topic-Supervised Non-Negative Matrix Factorization model, using a Weak-Labeling strategy on user trajectories with data obtained from open datasets, such as GTFS and OpenStreetMap. As a case study, we show results for the city of Santiago, Chile, which has a sophisticated intermodal public transportation system. Importantly, our pipeline delivers coherent results that are explainable, with interpretable parameters at each step. Finally, we discuss the potential applications and implications of such a system in transportation and urban planning.;"[Graells-Garrido, Eduardo; Caro, Diego] Univ Desarrollo, Data Sci Inst, Fac Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Graells-Garrido, Eduardo; Caro, Diego] Telefon R&D, Santiago, Chile; [Parra, Denis] Pontificia Univ Catolica, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile";"Graells-Garrido, E (corresponding author), Univ Desarrollo, Data Sci Inst, Fac Engn, Santiago, Chile.; Graells-Garrido, E (corresponding author), Telefon R&D, Santiago, Chile.";egraells@udd.cl;"Caro, Diego/AAO-4218-2020; Parra, Denis/D-1388-2014; Parra, Denis/M-2967-2019";"Caro, Diego/0000-0002-3335-9920; Parra, Denis/0000-0001-9878-8761; ";"Chilean government [CORFO 13CEE2-21592 (2013-21592-1-INNOVA_PRODUCCION2013-21592-1)]; ConicytComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT); Fondecyt grantComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [11150783]; Fondef grantComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDEF [16i10222]; BRT+ Centre of Excellence - VREF";The analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebooks [70], jointly with the scikit-learn [71], pandas [72], geopandas, statsmodels [73], seaborn, ws-nfm [16], and imposm. parser libraries.

In 2016 the WHO formulated a comprehensive framework on integrated PCC services based on an international expert consultation. Yet, expert opinions may fail to recognize the needs of all health system stakeholders. Therefore, a consultation method that includes the health workforce and laypersons, can be instrumental to elaborate this framework more in-depth. This research sought to identify participants' perspectives on policy options and interventions to achieve people-centred health care services from a multi stakeholder perspective. Methods: Study participants, both laypersons and health professionals, were recruited in Belgium. A total of 53 participants engaged in one of the seven concept mapping workshops. In this workshop the concept mapping methodology developed by Trochim, a highly structured qualitative group method for brainstorming and idea sharing, was used to generate and structure participants perspectives on what is needed to achieve PCC services. The method was validated using the WHO framework. Results: The seven workshops together resulted in 452 different statements that were structured in a framework forming 35 clusters and four overarching domains. The four domains with their most prominent clusters were: (1) governance & policy with intersectoral health policies and affordable health for all; (2) health workforce with excellent communication skills, appreciation of health literacy challenges and respectful attitude based on cultural self-awareness; (3) integrated health services with a greater emphasis on prevention, health promotion and the availability of health education and (4) patient, person and community empowerment and participation with support for informal care, promotion of a healthy lifestyle and contextualised health education. Additionally, this study generated ideas that fitted into every single approach described in the WHO framework. Discussion and conclusion: This study shows that in order to achieve PCC a participative approach involving all stakeholders at all levels is needed. The concept mapping process is one of these approaches that brings together diverse stakeholders and foments their egalitarian and respectful participation. The framework that resulted from this study can inform future debate regarding planning, implementation and monitoring of PCC.";"[Leyns, Christine Cecile] Asociac Interdisciplinaria Atenc Primaria Salud B, Calle Antezana 686 Esquina Salamanca,Oficina 1D, Cochabamba, Bolivia; [Leyns, Christine Cecile; De Maeseneer, Jan; Willems, Sara] Univ Ghent, Dept Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Campus UZ Gent,6K3,Corneel Heymanslaan 10, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium";"Leyns, CC (corresponding author), Asociac Interdisciplinaria Atenc Primaria Salud B, Calle Antezana 686 Esquina Salamanca,Oficina 1D, Cochabamba, Bolivia.; Leyns, CC (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Campus UZ Gent,6K3,Corneel Heymanslaan 10, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.";Christine.Leyns@ugent.be;Leyns, Christine/A-3778-2012;Leyns, Christine/0000-0003-0247-4368;;;;59;4;4;1;7;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;1475-9276;;;INT J EQUITY HEALTH;Int.

This is mainly because of the shortfalls in accident reporting and recording systems. Construction industry being a hazardous industry, the rate of accidents is higher compared with other industries and apparently a high rate of under-reporting. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the rate of under-reporting, significant reasons for under-reporting and identify the shortcomings in the existing accident reporting system in Sri Lanka in aiming to recommend efficient mechanisms for occupational accident recording and reporting to construction industry. Design/methodology/approach Both secondary and primary data were tapped to gather required data. The secondary data were extracted from the records available in year 2014-2015 at the office of the commissioner for workmen's compensation and the industrial safety division of the Department of Labor (DoL) to analyze the rate of under-reporting. The primary data were obtained through expert interviews to explore the gaps in reporting system and to identify mechanisms to reduce under-reporting. Findings The findings revealed 80 per cent of construction accidents are under-reported. Eight gaps in the current accident recording and reporting system and key recommendations at organizational and national level for its improvements were identified. Originality/value The findings provide an insight of occupational safety and health (OSH) practices in construction industry and it can be used as an eye opening flash for safety law-makers and practitioners to revisit the existing regulations and practices.;"[De Silva, Nayanthara; Rathnayake, Uthpala] Univ Moratuwa, Dept Bldg Econ, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka; [Kulasekera, K.

Design/methodology/approach Design-based research was collaboratively enacted by a research team. The authors focused analysis on video-recorded collaborative coaching conferences, as well as shared discussions of those conferences between researchers, cooperating teachers (CTs) and field supervisors (FSs). At each of three iterations of coaching conversations, changes were made to the practice of collaborative coaching, allowing the research/design team to reflect upon practices and deepen the understanding of the development of design principles. Findings Three design principles of collaborative coaching grew through this research - a need for shared understanding and valuing of a coaching model amongst participants to guide decision making; a partnership between CTs and FSs in centering the PTs' reflection on problems of practice, including the need for CTs and FSs to continually reflect on how their shifting roles toward this goal; and a relational framework including transparent communication. The authors extend these principles through two narrative vignettes and a framework that focuses on hybrid spaces for coaching. Research limitations/implications The research questions and design did not inquire into the relationship between collaborative coaching and PTs' teaching practices. Practical implications Each narrative serves as a coaching model of how PTs, CTs and FSs, or triads, worked toward resolving practical challenges in coaching to better support PTs. The authors provide practical tools for teacher preparation programs to build collaborative relationships with teachers and schools. Originality/value Placing the PT into an active, leadership role in reflection on practice disrupts expert-novice and other binaries that may not serve programs that seek to prepare reflective practitioners. Previous studies have identified tensions when mentoring is not a collective process, but few studies have explored models that disrupt the two activity systems that often operate separately.";"[Wetzel, Melissa; Hoffman, James V.; Maloch, Beth; Vlach, Saba Khan; Svrcek, Natalie Sue; Martinez, Ashley; Lavender, Haylee] Univ Texas Austin, Curriculum & Instruct, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Taylor, Laura A.] Rhodes Coll, Educ Studies, Memphis, TN 38112 USA; [Dejulio, Samuel] Univ Texas San Antonio, Curriculum & Instruct, San Antonio, TX USA; [Martinez, Ashley] Austin Independent Sch Dist, Austin, TX USA; [Lavender, Haylee] Wayside Sch, Austin, TX USA";Wetzel, M (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Curriculum & Instruct, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;"mmwetzel@utexas.edu; jhoffman@austin.utexas.edu; bmaloch@austin.utexas.edu; saba.vlach@gmail.com; taylorlaur@gmail.com; natsvrcek@gmail.com; samueldejulio@hotmail.com; ash.b.martinez@gmail.com; haybellelav@gmail.com";Svrcek, Natalie/AAP-1829-2020;"Svrcek, Natalie/0000-0002-3703-4963; Taylor, Laura/0000-0002-1037-7042";;;;36;2;2;0;12;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2046-6854;;;INT J MENT COACH EDU;Int.

In response to these drivers, freshwater fishes are responding by shifting their distribution range, altering the timing of migration and spawning and through demographic processes. By 2050, the mean daily air temperature is predicted to increase by 2 to 3 degrees C in insular Newfoundland and by 3 to 4 degrees C in Labrador. Mean daily precipitation is also projected to increase in all locations, with increased intensity projected for several regions. To mitigate negative consequences of these changes, managers require analytical approaches that describe the vulnerability of fish to climate change. To address this need, the current study adopts the National Marine Fisheries Service vulnerability assessment framework to characterize the vulnerability of freshwater fishes in Newfoundland and Labrador. Twelve vulnerability indicators were developed from an extensive literature review and applied to the assessment. Experts were solicited using an online questionnaire survey and scores for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity were collated and analyzed to derive a final vulnerability score and rank for each species. The analysis showed one species to be of high-very high vulnerability, two species were highly vulnerable while four species were moderately vulnerable to climate change. The result provides insight into the factors that drive vulnerability of freshwater fishes in the region, this information is significant to decision-makers and other stakeholders engaged in managing freshwater fish resources in Newfoundland and Labrador.;"[Olusanya, Hope O.] Mem Univ Grenfell Campus, Environm Policy Inst, Corner Brook, NF, Canada; [de Jong, M. van Zyll] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol Sci, St John, NB, Canada";Olusanya, HO (corresponding author), Mem Univ Grenfell Campus, Environm Policy Inst, Corner Brook, NF, Canada.;hoo070@grenfell.mun.ca;;;;;;49;3;3;0;16;PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE;SAN FRANCISCO;1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA;1932-6203;;;PLOS ONE;PLoS One;DEC 3;2018;13;12;;;;;;;e0208182;10.1371/journal.pone.0208182;;;13;Multidisciplinary Sciences;Science & Technology - Other Topics;HC6BO;WOS:000451886500029;30507972;DOAJ Gold, Green Published, Green Accepted;;;2021-02-18;

Therefore, the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution has been described as a model where new modes of production and consumption will dramatically transform all major industrial systems; it has been targeted by many governmental plans as a goal for a sustainable future. While general frameworks describing 4.0 paradigm are codified and accessible, implementation strategies and their implications on specific local and sectorial systems are largely unexplored. Starting from this assumption, this paper aims to provide insights on the current state of the art and major trends of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, possibly identifying its impacts on the textile and apparel industry. Design/methodology/approach From a methodological standpoint, the study approaches the topic from the perspective of fashion domain experts which can contribute, with a positioning essay, to better understanding Industry 4.0 (I4.0) implementation within their specific domain. This experts' perspective is enriched by several descriptive case studies (Yin, 1984) offering examples and insights on possible implementation of I4.0 solutions in fashion industry, also showing the potential of a design driven perspective. Findings Starting from a synthesis of I4.0 framework and principles, the paper aims at showing their impacts on business units, processes and components within the specific context of the fashion industry. Through emerging evidences detected by experts' domain perspective and exemplified by several descriptive cases, it offers a comprehensive overview of the potential implications of the Forth Industrial Revolution on this specific business. The picture drafted clearly shows how digital transformation, properly driven, could reshape the fashion industry into a more sustainable and truly customer-driven business. But, it also underlines criticalities and slowness of adoption by traditional established brands and companies. As a result, being focused on on-going phenomena, highly unexplored, it shows possible trajectories, enabling an effective transformation of textile and apparel industry embracing the I4.0 paradigm. Originality/value The paper has a broad perspective and could offer insights to different audiences, which could effectively contribute to a positive transition, to scholars and academics, who might want to better address the implementation of I4.0 model into real economic and social context, focusing on medium - long-term implications and showing innovation pathways which are still unexplored, second to practitioners, who are usually immersed into strict silos of competences and business functions and can start to build new bridges and interconnection within the system, taking advantages of I4.0 potential, finally to policy-makers who can better shape development frameworks targeted to specific industries whose features require peculiar approaches and actions.";"[Bertola, Paola] Polytech Univ Milan, Design Dept, Milan, Italy; [Teunissen, Jose] London Coll Fash, London, England";Bertola, P (corresponding author), Polytech Univ Milan, Design Dept, Milan, Italy.;paola.bertola@polimi.it;;;;;;56;18;19;15;109;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;1560-6074;;;RES J TEXT APPAR;Res.

Design/methodology/approach The paper reviewed both academic and trade literature to provide an overview of how robots will affect the hospitality industry during the 2030s. Findings Experts predict that by 2030, robots will make up about 25 per cent of the workforce in the hospitality industry. The paper also explains the industry challenges the robots will solve, as well as other benefits they provide. One of the findings is that the adoption of robots by the industry will be a disruptive paradigm shift. It will create successful new hospitality companies while putting others out of business. Finally, this paper discusses how to keep the hospitality in hospitality businesses, when machines replace employees. Originality/value This paper is one of the first to discuss the disruption that robots will cause in the industry. One of the findings is service delivery systems will need to be redesigned to maximize the benefits of robots, while still maintaining the hospitality of a customer service orientation.;"[Bowen, John; Morosan, Cristian] Univ Houston, Conrad N Hilton Coll Hotel & Restaurant Managemen, Houston, TX 77004 USA";Bowen, J (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Conrad N Hilton Coll Hotel & Restaurant Managemen, Houston, TX 77004 USA.;bowen@ipdt.pt;Bowen, John/K-4040-2019;Bowen, John/0000-0001-9817-9552;;;;24;24;24;6;51;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;1755-4217;1755-4225;;WORLDW HOSP TOUR THE;Worldw.

Detecting and treating at the premalignant stage has the potential to improve this. Helicobacter pylori is also a strong risk factor for this disease. Aims: Primary aims were to assess the diagnostic accuracy of magnified narrow band imaging (NBI-Z) endoscopy and serology in detecting normal mucosa, H. pylori gastritis and gastric atrophy. Secondary aims were to compare the diagnostic accuracies of two classification systems using both NBI-Z and white light endoscopy with magnification (WLE-Z) and evaluate the inter-observer agreement. Methods: Patients were prospectively recruited. Images of gastric mucosa were stored with histology and serum for IgG H. pylori and Pepsinogen (PG) I/II ELISAs. Blinded expert endoscopists agreed on mucosal pattern. Mucosal images and serological markers were compared with histology. Kappa statistics determined inter-observer variability for randomly allocated images among four experts and four non-experts. Results: 116 patients were prospectively recruited. Diagnostic accuracy of NBI-Z for determining normal gastric mucosa was 0.87(95%CI 0.82-0.92), H. pylori gastritis 0.65(95%CI 0.55-0.75) and gastric atrophy 0.88(95%CI 0.81-0.94). NBI-Z was superior to serology at detecting gastric atrophy: NBI-Z gastric atrophy 0.88(95%CI 0.81-0.94) vs PGI/II ratio < 3 0.74(95%CI 0.62-0.85) p<.0001. Overall NBI-Z was superior to WLE-Z in detecting disease using two validated classifications. Inter-observer agreement was 0.63(95%CI 0.51-0.73). Conclusions: NBI-Z accurately detects changes in the GI mucosa which currently depend on histology. NBI-Z is useful in the detection of precancerous conditions, potentially improving patient outcomes with early intervention to prevent gastric cancer.;"[White, Jonathan R.] Nottingham Univ Hosp NHS Trust, NIHR Nottingham Biomed Res Ctr, Derby Rd, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England; [White, Jonathan R.] Univ Nottingham, Derby Rd, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England; [White, Jonathan R.; Reddiar, Dona; Ortiz-Fernandez-Sordo, Jacobo; Beg, Sabina; Scott, Robert; Thiagarajan, Prarthana; Parra-Blanco, Adolfo; Kasi, Madhavi; Robinson, Karen; Atherton, John C.; Ragunath, Krish] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Digest Dis Ctr, Nottingham, England; Mayo Clin, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Rochester, MN USA; Univ Hosp Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, Dept Gastroenterol, Coventry, W Midlands, England; Kings Mill Hosp, Sherwood Forest Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Sutton In Ashfield, Notts, England; Hellen Red Cross Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Athens, Greece; Keele Univ, Primary Care Sci, Res Inst Primary Care & Hlth Sci, Keele, Staffs, England; Nottingham Univ Hosp NHS Trust, Queens Med Ctr Campus, Dept Pathol, Nottingham, England";"White, JR (corresponding author), Nottingham Univ Hosp NHS Trust, NIHR Nottingham Biomed Res Ctr, Derby Rd, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England.; White, JR (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Derby Rd, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England.";jonathan.white@nottingham.ac.uk;"Thiagarajan, P./AAP-7939-2020; Mannath, Jayan/AAD-1157-2020; Beg, Sabina/AAI-6931-2020; Parra-Blanco, Adolfo/AAA-5026-2019";"Thiagarajan, P./0000-0002-9373-8543; Scott, Robert/0000-0003-4281-7564; Davis, Jillian/0000-0001-7915-4149; Ragunath, Krish/0000-0001-6571-5435";National Institute for Health Research Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and The University of Nottingham, United Kingdom;This work was supported by the National Institute for Health Research Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and The University of Nottingham, United Kingdom.;;57;6;6;0;3;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0036-5521;1502-7708;;SCAND J GASTROENTERO;Scand.

These agents differ from cytotoxic chemotherapy for their mechanism of action and toxicity. By targeting specific antigens present on healthy cells and modulating immune system activity, these biological drugs are able to generate a wide spectrum of peculiar adverse events that can negatively impact on patients' quality of life. Areas covered: In this review, the main side effects associated with the use of moAbs have been described to show their incidence and current management strategies, which may drive clinicians in their daily practice. Expert opinion: The majority of these drugs represents an example of successful innovation, since they are able to induce a significant improvement of patients' survival and quality of life without any increase in related side effects as compared to standard cancer treatments. For this reason, they have become new milestones in personalized therapy for different non-hematological malignancies. With the increasing use of moAbs in treatment regimens, it is strongly recommended that clinicians are knowledgeable about the side effects associated with these agents, their management and monitoring, to optimize the clinical treatment of cancer patients.;"[Corsini, Lidia Rita; Fanale, Daniele; Passiglia, Francesco; Incorvaia, Lorena; Gennusa, Vincenzo; Bazan, Viviana; Russo, Antonio] Univ Palermo, Sect Med Oncol, Dept Surg Oncol & Oral Sci, Via Vespro 129, I-90127 Palermo, Italy";Russo, A (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Sect Med Oncol, Dept Surg Oncol & Oral Sci, Via Vespro 129, I-90127 Palermo, Italy.;antonio.russo@usa.net;;;;;;159;3;3;0;5;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1474-0338;1744-764X;;EXPERT OPIN DRUG SAF;Expert Opin.

This study seeks to broaden current discourse on gender identity measurement in the USA, including measurement adoption challenges and mitigation strategies, thereby allowing for better data collection to understand and address health disparities for people of all genders. Three data sources were used to triangulate findings: expert interviews with gender and sexuality research leaders; key-informant interviews with gender minorities in New Orleans, LA; and document analysis of relevant surveys, guides and commentaries. Ten key dilemmas were identified: 1) moving beyond binary gender construction; 2) conflation of gender, sex and sexual orientation; 3) emerging nature of gender-related language; 4) concerns about item sensitivity; 5) research fatigue among gender minorities; 6) design and analytical limitations; 7) categorical and procedural consistency; 8) pre-populated vs. open-field survey items; 9) potential misclassification; and 10) competing data collection needs.

The latter group of tumor responds better to treatment than the non-virally induced VSCC. This may be explained by a difference in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). Areas covered: This review summarizes literature on TME of VSCC and its precursors, and extrapolates this to foster the development of new therapeutic strategies. Expert opinion: Both types of VSCC and their precursors are infiltrated with variable numbers of M2 macrophages, regulatory T cells and CD8+ T cells, indicating that they express targetable tumor antigens. Type 1 T cell immunity in precursor lesions is associated with fewer recurrences and better clinical responses to immunotherapy. Escape of these lesions and progression toward VSCC is associated with the downregulation of HLA Class I, increased expression of co-inhibitory molecules, infiltration with immunosuppressive cells and the local production of immunosuppressive enzymes and cytokines. More in-depth studies of the VSCC TME are required to fully comprehend the impact of the immune system on VSCC, and subsequently to identify patients who will benefit from immunotherapeutic strategies.;"[Abdulrahman, Ziena; Van der Burg, Sjoerd H.] Leiden Univ, Dept Med Oncol, Med Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands; [Abdulrahman, Ziena; Kortekaas, Kim E.; Van Steenwijk, Peggy J.

However, in the space of oral medications, all current commercially available gastric resident dosage forms, and most in development, are limited to gastric residence of less than 1 day. Areas covered: Reviews of systems to extend gastric residence reveal that 1 day or more residence has been an unmet challenge. New dosage forms are in development that seek to address many of the key physiological and design challenges of long-term gastric retention beyond 24 h and up to a week or longer. The present analysis highlights the design, material considerations and implications of unfolding dosage form systems with ultra-long-term gastric residence. Expert opinion: The development of oral dosage forms providing sustained release of high potency medications over days or weeks could transform care, significantly decrease patient burden in chronic disease management and improve outcomes.;"[Altreuter, David H.; Grant, Tyler; Kruger, Cecilia; Bellinger, Andrew M.] Lyndra Inc, Watertown, MA 02472 USA; [Kirtane, Ameya R.; Traverso, Giovanni] MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kirtane, Ameya R.; Traverso, Giovanni] MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Traverso, Giovanni] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Traverso, Giovanni] MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Bellinger, Andrew M.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA";"Bellinger, AM (corresponding author), Lyndra Inc, Watertown, MA 02472 USA.; Traverso, G (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Chem Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.; Traverso, G (corresponding author), MIT, David H Koch Inst Integrat Canc Res, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.; Traverso, G (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.; Traverso, G (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.; Bellinger, AM (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA.";"ctraverso@partners.org; abellinger@lyndra.com";"Kirtane, Ameya/Y-8203-2019; Traverso, Carlo Giovanni/ABC-9065-2020";"Kirtane, Ameya/0000-0002-3779-0363; Traverso, Carlo Giovanni/0000-0001-7851-4077";"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [AI131416, EB024484, TR001889]; Division of Gastroenterology, Brigham and Women's Hospital; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [R44TR001889, R44TR001889] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI131416, R01AI131416, R01AI131416, R01AI131416] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB) [R43EB024484] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";This authors were supported in part by NIH Grants AI131416, EB024484, TR001889, and the Division of Gastroenterology, Brigham and Women's Hospital.;;41;5;5;2;21;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1742-5247;1744-7593;;EXPERT OPIN DRUG DEL;Expert Opin.

Although no curative therapy is currently available, a number of drugs are used in induction and maintenance therapy; however, for most of these drugs, a high inter-individual variability in response is observed. Among the factors of this variability, genetics plays an important role. Areas covered: This review summarizes the results of pharmacogenetic studies, considering the most important drugs used and in particular aminosalycilates, glucocorticoids, thiopurines, monoclonal antibodies and thalidomide. Most studies used a candidate gene approach, even if significant breakthroughs have been obtained recently from applying genome-wide studies. When available, also investigations considering epigenetics and pharmacogenetic dosing guidelines have been included. Expert opinion: Only for thiopurines, genetic markers identified as predictors of efficacy or adverse events have allowed the development of dosing guidelines. For the other drugs, encouraging results are available and great expectations rely on the study of epigenetics and integration with pharmacokinetic information, especially useful for biologics. However, to improve therapy of IBD patients with these drugs, for implementation in the clinics of pharmacogenetics, informatic clinical decision support systems and training about pharmacogenetics of health providers are needed.";"[Lucafo, Marianna] Natl Canc Inst, Ctr Riferimento Oncol, Expt & Clin Pharmacol Unit, Aviano, Italy; [Lucafo, Marianna; Franca, Raffaella; Decorti, Giuliana] Inst Maternal & Child Hlth IRCCS Burlo Garo, Diagnost Dept, Trieste, Italy; [Franca, Raffaella; Decorti, Giuliana] Univ Trieste, Dept Med Surg & Hlth Sci, Trieste, Italy; [Selvestrel, Davide; Curci, Debora; Pugnetti, Letizia] Univ Trieste, Sch Sci Reprod & Dev, Trieste, Italy; [Stocco, Gabriele] Univ Trieste, Dept Life Sci, Trieste, Italy";"Stocco, G (corresponding author), Inst Maternal & Child Hlth IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Via A Fleming 22, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.; Stocco, G (corresponding author), Univ Trieste, Via A Fleming 22, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.";decorti@units.it;"; Lucafo, Marianna/K-2312-2018";"Franca, Raffaella/0000-0001-8569-2023; Curci, Debora/0000-0002-3273-9489; Lucafo, Marianna/0000-0003-1355-3782";;;;146;7;7;0;8;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1742-5255;1744-7607;;EXPERT OPIN DRUG MET;Expert Opin.

Assuming the 'right drug' is selected, clinicians still need to decide on the 'right dose' for individuals. Ideally, optimal dosing should be studied in clinical trials; however, many drugs on the market lack evidence-based dosing recommendations, and small groups of patients (orphan disease populations) are dependent on local guidance and clinician experience to determine drug dosage adjustments. Areas Covered: This report explores the current understanding of dosing adjustment in special populations and examines the requirements for developing 'in silico' models for pediatric, elderly and pregnant patients. The report also highlights current use of modeling to provide evidence-based recommendations for drug labeling in the absence of complete clinical trials in orphan disease populations. Expert Opinion: Physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) is an attractive prospect for determining the best drug dosage adjustments in special populations. However, it is not sufficient for individualized, or even stratified dosing, unless the systems (drug-independent) data required to build robust PBPK models are obtained. Such models are not a substitute for clinical trials, but they are an alternative to undocumented and inconsistent guesswork.";"[Howard, Martyn; Barber, Jill; Rostami-Hodjegan, Amin] Univ Manchester, Ctr Appl Pharmacokinet Res, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Alizai, Naved] Leeds Childrens Hosp, Leeds Gen Infirm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England";Rostami-Hodjegan, A (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Ctr Appl Pharmacokinet Res, Manchester, Lancs, England.;amin.rostami@manchester.ac.uk;;"Howard, Martyn/0000-0003-1573-873X; Rostami-Hodjegan, Amin/0000-0003-3917-844X";Children's Liver Disease (CLDF) PhD Student Fellowship [NL 1758];M Howard is a recipient of a Children's Liver Disease (CLDF) PhD Student Fellowship (NL 1758) through which this paper was funded.;;117;5;5;2;6;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1742-5255;1744-7607;;EXPERT OPIN DRUG MET;Expert Opin.

The variety of innovative drug- and gene-based approaches warrants the development of assays that can allow disease modeling and high-throughput screening of drugs. Areas covered: This article aims to highlight the role of stem cells in the development of models that can recapitulate the pathophysiology of CF in the lungs, pancreas, liver, and gut. Particular emphasis will be placed upon the use of these models, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and adult stem cells, in the screening of innovative drugs that are in the development pipeline. Expert opinion: iPSCs and adult stem cells have allowed the reconstitution of facets of CF disease in vitro and in vivo models, and, when converted to organoids, have been successfully employed for the screening of drug and gene therapies across CF patients with both common and rare CFTR mutations. These systems can be further optimized for establishing a correlation between ex-vivo effects and in vivo responses in patients and offer an unprecedented opportunity to realize a personalized approach to the treatment of CF.;"[Conese, Massimo; Beccia, Elisa; Castellani, Stefano; Di Gioia, Sante] Univ Foggia, Lab Expt & Regenerat Med, Dept Med & Surg Sci, Foggia, Italy; [Beccia, Elisa; Angiolillo, Antonella] Univ Molise, Dept Med & Hlth Sci V Tiberio, Campobasso, Italy; [Carbone, Annalucia] IRCCS Casa Sollievo Sofferenza, Div Internal Med, San Giovanni Rotondo, FG, Italy; [Carbone, Annalucia] IRCCS Casa Sollievo Sofferenza, Chronobiol Unit, San Giovanni Rotondo, FG, Italy; [Corti, Fabiola; Colombo, Carla] Univ Milan, Fdn IRCCS Ca Granda Osped Maggiore Policlin, Cyst Fibrosis Ctr, Dept Pathophysiol & Transplantat, Milan, Italy";Conese, M (corresponding author), Univ Foggia, Lab Expt & Regenerat Med, Dept Med & Surg Sci, Foggia, Italy.;massimo.conese@unifg.it;"Conese, Massimo/AAB-7926-2019; Angiolillo, Antonella/F-4941-2012";"Angiolillo, Antonella/0000-0002-0158-3039; Conese, Massimo/0000-0003-3465-6641; castellani, stefano/0000-0003-0201-7298";Italian Ministry of HealthMinistry of Health, Italy [LAW 548/93];This paper was supported by the Italian Ministry of Health (LAW 548/93).;;99;0;0;0;6;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;2167-8707;;;EXPERT OPIN ORPHAN D;Exp.

QS creates a positive feedback loop that induces a cascade of gene expression and causes biofilm formation, virulence and sporulation. QS signals are diverse, acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), AI peptide (AIP) and AI-2 are three major categories of QS signals. QS inhibitors (QSIs) can disrupt or prevent the formation of biofilm and reduce virulence while exerting less selective pressure on the bacteria, suggesting that QSIs are potential alternatives for antibiotics. Areas covered: This review summarized the pertinent patents on QS inhibition available from 2014 to 2018. The authors analyze these patents and provided an overview of them and their potential applications. Expert opinion: The main strategy for QS inhibition is to use the analogues of various QS signals to block downstream signal transducers. The inactivation of signal molecules or the stimulation of the immune response is also attractive strategies to inhibit QS. However, additional clinical trials are needed to assess their efficacy in mammals. In sum, QS inhibition can reduce the virulence of bacteria without affecting their growth or killing them and the reduced pressure may minimize the increasingly resistance.;"[Chen, Xin; Zhang, Likun; Zhang, Mingxiang; Liu, Huayu; Lu, Panrui; Lin, Kejiang] China Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Pharm, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China";Lin, KJ (corresponding author), China Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Pharm, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;link@cpu.edu.cn;Lin, Kejiang/D-7552-2013;Lin, Kejiang/0000-0001-6351-5683;;;;126;24;26;4;63;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1354-3776;1744-7674;;EXPERT OPIN THER PAT;Expert Opin.

The UPS contains two distinct steps: ubiquitination of a substrate protein by ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3), and substrate degradation by the 26S proteasome complex. The E3 enzyme is the central player in the ubiquitination step and has a wide range of specific substrates in cancer cells, offering great opportunities for discovery and development of selective drugs. Areas covered: This review summarizes the recent advances in small molecule inhibitors of E1s, E2s, and E3s, with a focus on the latest patents (from 2015 to 2018) of E3 inhibitors and modulators. Expert opinion: One strategy to overcome limitations of current 20S proteasome inhibitors is to discover inhibitors of the upstream key components of the UPS, such as E3 enzymes. E3s play important roles in cancer development and determine the specificity of substrate ubiquitination, offering novel target opportunities. E3 modulators could be developed by rational design, natural compound or library screening, old drug repurposes, and application of other novel technologies. Further understanding of mechanisms of E3-substrate interaction will be essential for discovering and developing next-generation E3 inhibitors as effective anticancer drugs.;"[Li, Xin] Guangdong Polytech Sci & Trade, Dept Biotechnol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Xin] South China Univ Technol, Sch Food Sci & Engn, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Green Proc Nat Prod & Prod, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Xin; Elmira, Ekinci; Rohondia, Sagar; Wang, Jicang; Dou, Q.

Efforts to understand the generative properties of cancer cells span all biological scales: from genetic deviations and alterations of metabolic pathways to physical stresses due to overcrowding, as well as the effects of therapeutics and the immune system. While these factors have long been studied in the laboratory, mathematical and computational techniques are being increasingly applied to help understand and forecast tumor growth and treatment response. Advantages of mathematical modeling of proliferation include the ability to simulate and predict the spatiotemporal development of tumors across multiple experimental scales. Central to proliferation modeling is the incorporation of available biological data and validation with experimental data. Areas covered: We present an overview of past and current mathematical strategies directed at understanding tumor cell proliferation. We identify areas for mathematical development as motivated by available experimental and clinical evidence, with a particular emphasis on emerging, non-invasive imaging technologies. Expert commentary: The data required to legitimize mathematical models are often difficult or (currently) impossible to obtain. We suggest areas for further investigation to establish mathematical models that more effectively utilize available data to make informed predictions on tumor cell proliferation.;"[Jarrett, Angela M.; Lima, Ernesto A.

In gliomas, IDH mutations are primarily detected in WHO grade II-III tumors and represent a major biomarker with diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive implications. The recent development of IDH inhibitors and vaccines suggests that the IDH mutation is also an appealing target for therapy. Areas covered: This review focuses on the role of IDH mutations in diffuse gliomas. Besides discussing their role in gliomagenesis, we will emphasize the role of IDH mutations in clinical practice as a diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarker, and as a potential therapeutic target. Noninvasive detection of the IDH mutation by means of liquid biopsy and MR spectroscopy will also be discussed. Expert commentary: While IDH mutation is a consolidated diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in clinical practice, its role in oncogenesis is far from being elucidated, and there are several pending issues. The routine use of noninvasive techniques for detection and monitoring of the IDH status remains challenging. Although the IDH mutation is a very early alteration in gliomagenesis, it may then be omitted during tumor progression. This observation has important implications when designing targeted clinical trials.;"[Picca, Alberto] Univ Pavia, Neurosci Consortium, Pavia, Italy; [Berzero, Giulia] IRCCS Mondino Fdn, Neuroncol Unit, Pavia, Italy; [Berzero, Giulia] Univ Pavia, Biomed Sci, Pavia, Italy; [Di Stefano, Anna Luisa; Sanson, Marc] Sorbonne Univ, Paris, France; [Di Stefano, Anna Luisa] Foch Hosp, Dept Neurol, Paris, France; [Sanson, Marc] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Serv Neurol 2, Paris, France";Sanson, M (corresponding author), GH Pitie Salpetriere, Serv Neurol 2, 47 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.;marc.sanson@psl.aphp.fr;"Berzero, Giulia/AAA-4424-2019; Di Stefano, Anna Luisa/AAS-7836-2020";"Berzero, Giulia/0000-0001-8798-9058; Di Stefano, Anna Luisa/0000-0003-1746-0647; Picca, Alberto/0000-0001-7807-5393";;;;157;6;6;1;15;TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS;OSLO;KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY;1473-7159;1744-8352;;EXPERT REV MOL DIAGN;Expert Rev.

The angiogenic factors sFlt-1 and placental growth factor (PGF) have been in focus and have been massively supported. Areas covered: This review describes preeclampsia and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), focusing on sFlt-1 and PGF, their sources during and outside pregnancy and the application of these markers in diseases outside pregnancy. Finally, the specificity of the angiogenic markers for preeclampsia is discussed. Expert commentary: The admixture of the two independent syndromes preeclampsia and IUGR has not helped in identifying the etiologies of either. Rather, it has made the search for new markers and pathways much more complicated as has the constriction on the angiogenic markers. The current markers sFlt-1 and PGF have a clear value once an adverse outcome is diagnosed but are not specific for preeclampsia. Also, they are mostly derived from the maternal vascular system rather than the placenta and are already in use as markers outside pregnancy. A new holistic approach using disease maps and interoperable workflows based on topic-related big data will help in broadening our understanding of the etiology of preeclampsia and hence, develop new markers and therapies.;[Huppertz, Berthold] Med Univ Graz, Gottfried Schatz Res Ctr, Div Cell Biol Histol & Embryol, Neue Stiftingtalstr 6-2, A-8010 Graz, Austria;Huppertz, B (corresponding author), Med Univ Graz, Gottfried Schatz Res Ctr, Div Cell Biol Histol & Embryol, Neue Stiftingtalstr 6-2, A-8010 Graz, Austria.;berthold.huppertz@medunigraz.at;Huppertz, Berthold/I-2331-2019;Huppertz, Berthold/0000-0003-4814-2158;;;;86;5;5;1;11;TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS;OSLO;KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY;1473-7159;1744-8352;;EXPERT REV MOL DIAGN;Expert Rev.

The disorder is associated with autoantibodies to the ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (gAChR). We subsequently reported that AAG is associated with an overrepresentation of psychiatric symptoms, sensory disturbance, autoimmune diseases, and endocrine disorders. Area covered: The aim of this review was to describe AAG and highlight its pivotal pathophysiological aspects, clinical features, laboratory examinations, and therapeutic options. Expert commentary: AAG is a complex neuroimmunological disease, these days considered as an autonomic failure with extra-autonomic manifestations (and various limited forms). Further comprehension of the pathophysiology of this disease is required, especially the mechanisms of the extra-autonomic manifestations should be elucidated. There is the possibility that the co-presence of antibodies that were directed against the other subunits in both the central and peripheral nAChRs in the serum of the AAG patients.

Currently, diagnosis is based on subjective rather than objective determinations leading to misdiagnose and ineffective treatments. Advances in novel neurobiological methods have allowed assessment of promising biomarkers to diagnose depression and PTSD, which offers a new means of appropriately treating patients. Areas covered: Biomarkers discovery in blood represents a fundamental tool to predict, diagnose, and monitor treatment efficacy in depression and PTSD. The potential role of altered HPA axis, epigenetics, NPY, BDNF, neurosteroid biosynthesis, the endocannabinoid system, and their function as biomarkers for mood disorders is discussed. Insofar, we propose the identification of a biomarker axis to univocally identify and discriminate disorders with large comorbidity and symptoms overlap, so as to provide a base of support for development of targeted treatments. We also weigh in on the feasibility of a future blood test for early diagnosis. Expert commentary: Potential biomarkers have already been assessed in patients' blood and need to be further validated through multisite large clinical trial stratification. Another challenge is to assess the relation among several interdependent biomarkers to form an axis that identifies a specific disorder and secures the best-individualized treatment. The future of blood-based tests for PTSD and depression is not only on the horizon but, possibly, already around the corner.;"[Aspesi, Dario; Pinna, Graziano] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychiat, Inst Psychiat, 1601 W Taylor Str, Chicago, IL 60612 USA";Pinna, G (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Psychiat, Inst Psychiat, 1601 W Taylor Str, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.;gpinna@uic.edu;;Aspesi, Dario/0000-0002-7655-112X;"U.S. Department of DefenseUnited States Department of Defense [W81XWH-15-1-0521]; Veteran Affairs [VA241-15-D-0041]";This paper is supported by funding from U.S. Department of Defense, grant number: W81XWH-15-1-0521 and Veteran Affairs Grant VA241-15-D-0041 (to G.

Consequently, our aim was to measure the costs and disease burden of symptomatic dengue infections in Brazil from the perspective of the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) between 2000 and 2015, using Brazilian public health system databases. Specific age group incidence estimates were used to calculate the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to gain a better understanding of the disease burden. Areas covered: SUS spent almost USD159 million and USD10 million to treat dengue and severe dengue, respectively, between 2000 and 2015. This is principally hospitalization costs, with the majority of patients self-treated at home with minor symptoms. The average notification rate for dengue was 273 per 100,000 inhabitants and three per 100,000 for severe dengue, with annual DALYs estimates ranging between 72.35 and 6,824.45 during the 16 years. Expert commentary: The epidemiological and morbidity burden associated with dengue is substantial in Brazil, with costs affected by the fact that most patients self-treat at home with these costs not included in SUS. The Brazilian government urgently needs to proactively evaluate the real costs and clinical benefits of any potential dengue vaccination program by the National Immunization Program to guide future decision-making.;"[Godoi, Isabella Piassi; Guerra-Junior, Augusto Afonso] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Farm, Programa Posgrad Medicamentos & Assistencia Farm, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Godoi, Isabella Piassi; Guerra-Junior, Augusto Afonso] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Fac Farm, SUS Collaborating Ctr Technol Assessment & Excell, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Godoi, Isabella Piassi; Dias Da Silva, Leonardo Vinicius] Univ Fed Sul & Sudeste Para, Inst Hlth & Biol Studies, Ave Ipes S-N, Maraba, Para, Brazil; [Dias Da Silva, Leonardo Vinicius] Inst Ciencias Biol, Programa Interunidades Pos Grad Bioinformat, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Sarker, Abdur Razzaque] Icddr B, Hlth Econ & Financing Res, Hlth Syst & Populat Studies Div, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Sarker, Abdur Razzaque; Megiddo, Itamar; Morton, Alec] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Management Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Megiddo, Itamar] Ctr Dis Dynam, Econ & Policy, Washington, DC USA; [Godman, Brian; Alvarez-Madrazo, Samantha; Bennie, Marion] Strathclyde Univ, Strathclyde Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, Dept Pharmacoepidemiol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Godman, Brian] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Karolinska Inst, Div Clin Pharmacol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Godman, Brian] Univ Liverpool, Management Sch, Hlth Econ Ctr, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Godman, Brian] Sefako Hlth Sci Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Pharm Management, Sch Pharm, Pretoria, South Africa; [Alvarez-Madrazo, Samantha] Univ Strathclyde, Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, Farr Inst Hlth Informat Res, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland";"Godman, B (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Inst Pharm & Biomed Sci, Glasgow G4 0RE, Lanark, Scotland.; Godman, B (corresponding author), Karolinska Univ Hosp Huddinge, Karolinska Inst, Div Clin Pharmacol, SE-14186 Stockholm, Sweden.";brian.godman@strath.ac.uk;"Godoi, Isabella P/G-3544-2019; Junior, Augusto Afonso Guerra/AAS-6584-2020; Megiddo, Itamar/AAB-9016-2019; Godman, Brian/R-8897-2019; Godoi, Isabella/ABA-9542-2020; Alvarez-Madrazo, Samantha/F-2759-2018; Megiddo, Itamar/N-9839-2015";"Godoi, Isabella P/0000-0002-0568-6625; Junior, Augusto Afonso Guerra/0000-0001-5256-0577; Godoi, Isabella/0000-0002-0568-6625; Morton, Alec/0000-0003-3803-8517; Alvarez-Madrazo, Samantha/0000-0003-2026-8533; Vinicius Silva, Leonardo/0000-0003-1956-5100; Megiddo, Itamar/0000-0001-8391-6660; Sarker, Abdur Razzaque/0000-0002-2022-7590; Godman, Brian/0000-0001-6539-6972";Academy of Medical Sciences through the UK Government's Newton Fund program;The project was in part supported by a Newton Advanced Fellowship by the Academy of Medical Sciences to A.A.

In Algeria, stroke is a leading cause of death, representing 15.6% of all deaths in 2012. Current data on the epidemiology and costs associated with non-valvular AF (NVAF) in Algeria are not available. Methods: A three-step approach was undertaken to estimate the economic burden of NVAF in Algeria. First, a literature review identified the epidemiological burden of the disease. Second, expert clinicians practicing in Algerian hospitals were surveyed on consumed resources and unit costs of treatment and management of complications and prevention. Finally, these data were combined with event probabilities in an economic model to estimate the annual cost of NVAF prevention and complications for the Algerian healthcare system. Results: Based on literature and demographics data, it was estimated that there are currently 187,686 subjects with NVAF in Algeria. Seventy per cent of this population was treated for prevention, half of which were controlled. Cost of prevention was estimated at 203 million DZD (euro1.5 million) for drugs and 349 million DZD (euro2.6 million) for examinations. Mean hospitalization costs for complications ranged between 123,500 and 435,500 DZD (euro910-3,209), according to the type and severity of complications. Hospitalization costs for thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications were estimated at 8,313 million DZD (euro62 million), half of which was for untreated patients. Finally, the economic burden of NVAF was estimated at 8,865 million DZD (>euro65 million) annually. Conclusion: The economic burden of NVAF is important in Algeria, largely driven by untreated and INR-uncontrolled patients. There is a lack of information on the Algerian healthcare system that could increase uncertainty around this assessment, but it clearly establishes the importance of NVAF as a public health concern.;"[Bouame, Mounir] Hop Cent Armee Mohamed Seghir Nekache, Serv Cardiol, Algiers, Algeria; [Lahmar, Mohamed Ali] Etab Hosp Univ, Serv Cardiol, Oran, Algeria; [Bouafia, Mohamed Tahar] Ctr Hosp Univ, Serv Med Interne Cardiol, Unite Frantz Fanon, Blida, Algeria; [Hammoudi, Naima] HOp CNMS, Serv Cardiol, Algiers, Algeria; [Chentir, Mohamed Tayeb] Ctr Hosp Univ Mustapha Bacha, Serv Cardiol, Algiers, Algeria; [Athmane, Mouloud Ait] Ctr Hosp Univ Ibn Sina, Serv Cardiol, Annaba, Algeria; [Kara, Said] Clin Kara, Oran, Algeria; [Trancart, Matthieu] CEMKA EVAL, Bourg La Reine, France; [Yildiz, Levent; Cheynel, Jerome] Boehringer Ingelheim Middle East Turkey & Africa, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Soualmi, Redouane] Boehringer Ingelheim North West Africa, Algiers, Algeria";Soualmi, R (corresponding author), Cooperat Yasmine 29,Route stade, Ouled Fayet 16094, Alger, Algeria.;redouane.soualmi@boehringer-ingelheim.com;;;Boehringer IngelheimBoehringer Ingelheim;This study was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim.;;38;0;0;0;1;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1369-6998;1941-837X;;J MED ECON;J.

The current paradigm in this disease's etiopathogenesis points toward the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Among the environmental variables, dietary factors, intestinal microbiota, toxins, and psychological stress have been implicated in disease onset. Areas covered: This review aims to investigate the relationship between psychological stress and T1DM by presenting evidence from epidemiological studies, animal models, and to provide the mechanism involved in this association. The literature search was conducted through PubMed to identify studies that investigate the connection between stress and T1DM. Experimental designs, such as case-control, and retrospective and prospective cohorts studies, were included. Expert commentary: A wide array of evidence, ranging from epidemiological to animal models, points toward the role of psychological stressors in T1DM pathogenesis. Various mechanisms have been proposed, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, influence of the nervous system on immune cells, and insulin resistance. Further research could investigate the gene-stress interactions to evaluate the risk of T1DM development.;"[Sharif, Kassem; Watad, Abdulla; Amital, Howard] Sheba Med Ctr, Zabludowicz Ctr Autoimmune Dis, Dept Med B, Tel Hashomer, Israel; [Sharif, Kassem; Watad, Abdulla; Coplan, Louis; Amital, Howard; Shoenfeld, Yehuda; Afek, Arnon] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Shoenfeld, Yehuda; Afek, Arnon] Sheba Med Ctr, Zabludowicz Ctr Autoimmune Dis, Tel Hashomer, Israel; [Shoenfeld, Yehuda] Tel Aviv Univ, Laura Schwarz Kipp Chair Res Autoimmune Dis, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Shoenfeld, Yehuda] St Petersburg State Univ, Mosa Autoimmun Project, St Petersburg, Russia";"Shoenfeld, Y (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Tel Aviv, Israel.; Shoenfeld, Y (corresponding author), Sheba Med Ctr, Zabludowicz Ctr Autoimmune Dis, Tel Hashomer, Israel.; Shoenfeld, Y (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Laura Schwarz Kipp Chair Res Autoimmune Dis, Tel Aviv, Israel.; Shoenfeld, Y (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, Mosa Autoimmun Project, St Petersburg, Russia.";Yehuda.Shoenfeld@sheba.health.gov.il;;;;;;66;7;7;1;12;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1744-666X;1744-8409;;EXPERT REV CLIN IMMU;Expert Rev.

Continuing to provide and coordinate care in the current manner is not a viable route to sustain the improvements in health outcomes observed in recent history. To ensure that there continues to be improvement in patient care, prevention of disease, and reduced burden on health systems, it is essential that we adapt our models of delivery. Providers of health and social care are evolving to face these pressures by changing the way they think about the care system and, importantly, how to involve patients in the planning and delivery of services. Objective: The objective of this paper is to provide (1) an overview of the current state of Internet of Things (IoT) and key implementation considerations, (2) key use cases demonstrating technology capabilities, (3) an overview of the landscape for health care IoT use in Oxford, and (4) recommendations for promoting the IoT via collaborations between higher education institutions and industry proof-of-concept (PoC) projects. Methods: This study describes the PoC projects that will be created to explore cost-effectiveness, clinical efficacy, and user adoption of Internet of Medical Things systems. The projects will focus on 3 areas: (1) bring your own device integration, (2) chronic disease management, and (3) personal health records. Results: This study is funded by Research England's Connecting Capability Fund. The study started in March 2018, and results are expected by the end of 2019. Conclusions: Embracing digital solutions to support the evolution and transformation of health services is essential. Importantly, this should not simply be undertaken by providers in isolation. It must embrace and exploit the advances being seen in the consumer devices, national rollout of high-speed broadband services, and the rapidly expanding medical device industry centered on mobile and wearable technologies. Oxford University Hospitals and its partner providers, patients, and stakeholders are building on their leading position as an exemplar site for digital maturity in the National Health Service to implement and evaluate technologies and solutions that will capitalize on the IoT. Although early in the application to health, the IoT and the potential it provides to make the patient a partner at the center of decisions about care represent an exciting opportunity. If achieved, a fully connected and interoperable health care environment will enable continuous acquisition and real-time analysis of patient data, offering unprecedented ability to monitor patients, manage disease, and potentially deliver early diagnosis. The clinical benefit of this is clear, but additional patient benefit and value will be gained from being able to provide expert care at home or close to home.;"[Meinert, Edward; Van Velthoven, Michelle; Brindley, David] Univ Oxford, Dept Paediat, Healthcare Translat Res Grp, Oxford, England; [Meinert, Edward; Alturkistani, Abrar; Foley, Kimberley] Imperial Coll London, Dept Primary Care & Publ Hlth, Global Digital Hlth Unit, London, England; [Rees, Sian] Oxford Acad Hlth Sci Network, Oxford, England; [Wells, Glenn] Oxford Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, Oxford, England; [de Pennington, Nick] Oxford Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Oxford, England";Meinert, E (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe, Childrens Hosp, Healthcare Translat Res Grp,Dept Paediat, Level 2, Oxford OX3 9DU, England.;edward.meinert@paediatrics.ox.ac.uk;"van Velthoven, Michelle Helena/AAA-6819-2019; Meinert, Edward/L-7949-2019";"van Velthoven, Michelle Helena/0000-0003-1245-8759; Meinert, Edward/0000-0003-2484-3347; Brindley, David/0000-0002-5166-8583; Alturkistani, Abrar/0000-0001-7935-8870; de Pennington, Nick/0000-0003-4536-4978; Rees, Sian/0000-0003-3699-0811";"Sir David Cooksey Research Fellowship; Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS) Research Foundation; Oxford AHSC; Research England's Connecting Capability Fund (CCF)";The authors acknowledge their colleagues in the Department of Computer Science, Department of Engineering, Department of Pediatrics, and the Oxford AHSC for sharing their insights and expertise that assisted in initiating the idea of the project.

One major impediment to our understanding of cancer biology and finding innovative approaches to cancer treatment stems from the lack of better preclinical tumor models that address and explain tumor heterogeneity and person-to-person differences in therapeutic and toxic responses. Past cancer research has been driven by inadequate in vitro assays utilizing two-dimensional monolayers of cancer cells and animal models. Additionally, animal models do not truly mimic the original human tumor, are time consuming, and usually costly. New preclinical models are needed for innovation in cancer translational research. Hence, it is time to welcome the three-dimensional (3D) organoids: self-organizing cells grown in 3D culture systems mimicking the parent tissues from which the primary cells originate. The 3D organoids offer deeper insights into the crucial cellular processes in tissue and organ formation and pathological processes. Generation of near-perfect physiological microenvironments allow 3D organoids to couple with gene editing tools, such as the clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 and the transcription activator-like effector nucleases to model human diseases, offering distinct advantages over current models. We explain in this expert review that through recapitulating patients' normal and tumor tissues, organoid technology can markedly advance personalized medicine and help reveal once hidden aspects of cancers. The use of defined tissue-or organ-specific matrices, among other factors, will likely allow organoid technology to realize its potential in innovating many fields of life sciences.;"[Dzobo, Kevin; Rowe, Arielle; Senthebane, Dimakatso A.] ICGEB, Wernher & Beit Bldg South,UCT Campus,Anzio Rd, ZA-7925 Cape Town, Observatory, South Africa; [Dzobo, Kevin; Senthebane, Dimakatso A.; Patten, Victoria; Parker, M.

In recent times, a hardening of corporate human rights law has taken place. Several acts of hard law have been implemented at a national and EU level. This article provides an overview of the most important ones. The hard law provisions differ in their scope: some obligate companies to report on human rights, others stipulate concrete obligations to conduct human rights due diligence. Another way of tackling the issue of human rights compliance has been demonstrated by the prosecution of companies in the United States. While procedural guidelines abstractly stipulate an effective compliance system to be a mitigating factor, the US Department of Justice regularly defines concrete compliance obligations in deferred or non-prosecution agreements. This development could lead to comprehensive liability for negligence due to organisational and monitoring deficiencies. But who defines the standards? This article examines how the changing practice of human rights compliance may have feedback effects on hard law, particularly by changing the scale of negligence. Regarding the lack of effectiveness of some due diligence measures, especially in the certification industry, it is then asked how legislation may proactively exert influence by defining effective CSR instruments necessary to prevent civil and criminal liability. Using the example of German law, a proposal is made to implement an obligation of human rights due diligence in hard law and, simultaneously, set up an independent expert commission that drafts guidelines specifying the necessary measures for different kinds of companies.;"[Momsen, Carsten] Free Univ Berlin, Criminal Law Criminal Procedural Law Corp Crimina, Boltzmannstr 3, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Schwarze, Mathis] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Schwarze, Mathis] Univ Oxford, Ctr Criminol, Oxford, England";Momsen, C (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Criminal Law Criminal Procedural Law Corp Crimina, Boltzmannstr 3, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.;"lsmomsen@zedat.fu-berlin.de; mathis.schwarze@fu-berlin.de";;;;;;69;0;1;1;5;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1046-8374;1572-9850;;CRIM LAW FORUM;Crim.

The contribution of this work is a proposed approach for achieving the optimal design of interval type-2 fuzzy systems for the classification of the heart rate in patients. The fuzzy rule base was designed based on the knowledge of experts. Optimization of the membership functions of the fuzzy systems is done in order to improve the classification rate and provide a more accurate diagnosis, and for this goal the Bird Swarm Algorithm was used. Two different type-1 fuzzy systems are designed and optimized, the first one with trapezoidal membership functions and the second with Gaussian membership functions. Once the best type-1 fuzzy systems have been obtained, these are considered as a basis for designing the interval type-2 fuzzy systems, where the footprint of uncertainty was optimized to find the optimal representation of uncertainty. After performing different tests with patients and comparing the classification rate of each fuzzy system, it is concluded that fuzzy systems with Gaussian membership functions provide a better classification than those designed with trapezoidal membership functions. Additionally, tests were performed with the Crow Search Algorithm to carry out a performance comparison, with Bird Swarm Algorithm being the one with the best results.;"[Miramontes, Ivette; Carlos Guzman, Juan; Melin, Patricia] Tijuana Inst Technol, Div Grad Studies & Res, Tijuana 22379, Mexico; [Prado-Arechiga, German] Cardio Diagnost Excel Med Ctr, Tijuana 22010, Mexico";Melin, P (corresponding author), Tijuana Inst Technol, Div Grad Studies & Res, Tijuana 22379, Mexico.;"cynthiaivette84@gmail.com; jcguzmanpreciado89@gmail.com; pmelin@tectijuana.mx; germanprado.sinacor@gmail.com";"Melin, Patricia/B-3611-2013; Miramontes Ortega, Cynthia Ivette/U-1880-2018";"Melin, Patricia/0000-0001-5798-1426; Miramontes Ortega, Cynthia Ivette/0000-0001-5013-9500; guzman preciado, juan carlos/0000-0001-6534-876X";Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologiaConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [246774];This research was funded by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia [246774].;;45;10;10;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;1999-4893;;;ALGORITHMS;Algorithms;DEC;2018;11;12;;;;;;;206;10.3390/a11120206;;;35;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;HG1LI;WOS:000454716100017;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-02-18;

The focus is on patient screening and identifying patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), which represents a life threatening cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed approach operates with a large volume of raw ECG time-series data as inputs to a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). It autonomously learns representative and key features of the PAF to be used by a classification module. The features are therefore learned directly from the large time domain ECG signals by using a CNN with one fully connected layer. The learned features can effectively replace the traditional ad hoc and time-consuming user's hand-crafted features. Our experimental results verify and validate the effectiveness and capabilities of the learned features for PAF patient screening. The main advantages of our proposed approach are to simplify the feature extraction process corresponding to different cardiac arrhythmias and to remove the need for using a human expert to define appropriate and critical features working with a large time-series data set. The extensive simulations and case studies conducted indicate that combining the learned features with other classifiers will significantly improve the performance of the patient screening system as compared to an end-to-end CNN classifier. The effectiveness and capabilities of our proposed ECG DL classification machine is demonstrated and quantitative comparisons with several conventional machine learning classifiers are also provided.;"[Pourbabaee, Bahareh; Khorasani, Khashayar] Concordia Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Roshtkhari, Mehrsan Javan] SPORTLOGiQ, Montreal, PQ H2T 3B3, Canada";Khorasani, K (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.;"b_pourba@ece.concordia.ca; mehrsan@sportlogiq.com; kash@ece.concordia.ca";;Khorasani, Khashayar/0000-0002-6919-3889;;;;36;104;106;18;66;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2168-2216;2168-2232;;IEEE T SYST MAN CY-S;IEEE Trans.

Blood sugar and blood pressure are prognostic factors in diabetic retinopathy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of zinc supplementation on diabetes indices and blood pressure in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Patients and Methods: 45 patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (20 males and 25 females) aged from 40 to 70 years were participated in current double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. The disease was diagnosed by an expert ophthalmologist according to early photocoagulation and diabetic retinopathy criteria. The patients were assigned to intervention (23 patients) and placebo (n = 22) groups. The groups received zinc (as zinc gluconate; 30 mg) and placebo (maltodextrin; 30 mg) for 3 months, respectively. Fasting insulin, fasting glucose, insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and serum zinc levels were measured before and after the intervention in the both groups. Results: Zinc supplementation significantly increased serum zinc (P= 0.004) and decreased serum insulin levels (P= 0.008), fasting blood sugar (FBS) (P= 0.011), HOMA-IR (P= 0.002) and SBP (P= 0.017) in the intervention group compared with placebo group. The intervention had no significant effects on DBP, HbA1c.

The assessment was designed as a hybrid process that 1) gathered and analyzed existing and available quantitative data on natural hazards, including meteorological hazards and geological hazards; 2) executed a series of workshops at KYTC districts throughout the state to elicit local expert knowledge on transportation system vulnerabilities; and 3) incorporated all data into a single vulnerability assessment. The workshops involved several facilitated exercises, including map-based discussions and keypad exercises to identify vulnerabilities along highway segments. Data from the mapping and keypad exercises were gathered in a geographic information system (GIS) and combined with the other hazard data to identify vulnerabilities for each highway segment. FHWA's Vulnerability Assessment Scoring Tool (VAST) was used to process all the data into a single and ultimate assessment. Results from this analysis include a district-level prioritized ranking of NHS segments based on their vulnerability to extreme weather and natural hazard events. Additionally, a district vulnerability assessment report for each district highlighted the most vulnerable assets in the district and discussed their vulnerabilities in detail. This research is intended to aid KYTC in identifying at-risk infrastructure and direct the implementation of preparedness and resilience measures, thus helping to protect the integrity of the transportation system and the sound investment of taxpayer dollars.";"[Blandford, Benjamin; Wallace, Candice] Univ Kentucky, Kentucky Transportat Ctr, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Schurman, Scott] Kentucky Transportat Cabinet, Frankfort, KY USA";Blandford, B (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Kentucky Transportat Ctr, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.;Benjamin.Blandford@uky.edu;;;;;;23;1;1;0;2;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;0361-1981;2169-4052;;TRANSPORT RES REC;Transp.

Traffic emergency management during incident conditions is the core element of active traffic management, and it is of practical significance to accurately understand the duration time distribution for typical traffic incident types and the factors that influence incident duration. This study proposes a dual-learning Bayesian network (BN) model to estimate traffic incident duration and to examine the influence of heterogeneous factors on the length of duration based on expert knowledge of traffic incident management and highway incident data collected in Zhejiang Province, China. Fifteen variables related to three aspects of traffic incidents, including incident information, incident consequences, and rescue resources, were included in the analysis. The trained BN model achieves favorable performance in several areas, including classification accuracy, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under curve (AUC) value. A classification matrix, and significant variables and their heterogeneous influences are identified accordingly.

While this system reduces some risks, it adds complexity and new risks to businesses due to interdependence between the agricultural modules. To deal with these issues, integrated risk management is required to reduce the effects of risks and to take advantage of the opportunities of an ICLS. Generically, enterprise risk management (ERM) meets this need by proposing comprehensive and coherent risk management, instead of managing agricultural module risks individually. However, there is a need to customize the ERM approach to ICLS. Therefore, the current study aims to develop a method to manage risks for ICLS based on ERM, integrating the management of risks and aligning risk management with the strategic objectives. A literature review, a pilot study, interviews with experts, four case studies and 20 practitioners supported the method development and evaluation through three versions. As a result, the method identifies and relates risks through process mapping with a qualitative and quantitative analysis of their impacts, determines risk responses based on willingness to take risks, and helps identify processes to control, communicate and monitor the risks. The method also stimulates the implementation of ICLS in market-oriented farms, providing an approach to increase the chances of ICLS success. The main difference from previous research lies in the integrative management of multiple risks, the alignment of risks with strategy and the consideration that a risk might be considered an opportunity.;"[Correa, R.

Lack of interest by governmental agencies was the major obstacle for the development of conservation projects in Argentina. However, this factor appears to have evolved positively in the last 5 years. The limited participation of local communities and lack of funds were recognized as additional impediments, which showed variable temporal trends. The inadequacies of the education system and the lack of interdisciplinary approaches represented less important difficulties. Twenty-nine current carnivore conservation projects were recorded in 19 of the 23 Argentinean provinces, with a concentration in Neuquen and some northern provinces. Although 78.6% of the species of native carnivores forms part of at least one project, less than half of them are the focal species of a project. The number of projects per species ranges from 16 (for Puma concolor) to cero (for Pteronun2 brasiliensis, Lonny felina, Lyncodon patagonicus, Conepants humboldtii, and Leopatdus guigna). Whereas the number of projects/species was not related to a species' conservation status, we found a positive association between this indicator of conservation effort and body size.

To address this operational shortcoming, we explore the potential of health ministries to become learning organizations' to help foster resilience. We adopted a multi-stage, iterative methodology comprising multiple purposive literature searches, the selection and application of a conceptual framework from the learning organizations' literature, and expert opinion to expand on the framework with illustrative examples from LMICs. The principal finding of our prospecting assessment and appraisal is that many LMIC health ministries possess assets necessary for mounting a structured learning process for fostering increasingly resilient health systems. These assets include learning management strengths in systematic problem-solving, experimentation, self-analysis, learning from others and knowledge transfer. In addition, recent methodological advances in measuring progress towards becoming a learning organization enhance resilience-building potential. All health ministries, however, face substantial challenges in trying to realize their learning potential. They have to recognize the value of their learning assets and harness them in the service of a resilience-promoting learning agenda. Learning management and measurement skills must be complemented by supportive environments, sound leadership, and incentives that reinforce learning. The absence of models of sustained learning organizations in health sectors in LMICs and other countries hinders progress. Furthermore, our understanding of the dynamics of effective learning as well as the relationship between a learning organization and resilience is at a nascent stage. Increased attention to the role of adaptive capacity in fostering resilience may lead to more investment in systematic research on learning organizations and their effects on health system performance in LMICs.;"[Naimoli, Joseph F.] 11000 Candlelight Lane, Potomac, MD 20854 USA; [Saxena, Sweta] US Agcy Int Dev, Bur Asia Tech Serv, 1300 Penn Ave, Washington, DC 20523 USA";Naimoli, JF (corresponding author), 11000 Candlelight Lane, Potomac, MD 20854 USA.;joe.naimoli@gmail.com;;;;;;115;2;2;0;6;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0268-1080;1460-2237;;HEALTH POLICY PLANN;Health Policy Plan.;DEC;2018;33;10;;;;;1083;1095;;10.1093/heapol/czy100;;;13;"Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services";Health Care Sciences & Services;HQ8YR;WOS:000462713700004;30561593;;;;2021-02-18;

Discussion: A challenge with the MCBT and other cost-benefit tools is that users need to input, manually, a considerable amount of point-in-time data, a process that is time consuming, relies on subjective expert opinion, and introduces the potential for data-input error. In this paper, we present and discuss a conceptual model for a'smart' MCBT that utilises machine learning techniques. Summary: We argue that the Smart MCBT outlined in this paper will overcome the shortcomings of existing cost- benefit tools. It does this by reintegrating individual cost-benefit analysis (CBA) projects using a database system that securely stores and de-identifies project data, and redeploys it using a range of machine learning and data science techniques. In addition, the question of what works is respecified by the Smart MCBT tool as a data science pipeline, which serves to enhance CBA and reconfigure the policy making process in the paradigm of open data and data analytics.;"[Manning, Matthew; Wong, Gabriel T.

Postgraduate education of the Russian higher school is traditionally considered as a strategic reserve, which provides the continuity of academic and teaching personnel and the efficiency of education of future experts. However, the total number of this key resource of the higher education system, which guarantees its stable functioning and further forward development, has been reduced in recent years. Postgraduate admission has decreased, in particular, pedagogical training programmes. What is most important, the PhD student quality has substantially dropped. The aim of the present publication was to identify the level of research skills of PhD students of pedagogical specialisation and present the most productive ways for the formation of skills to carry out research activities. Methodology and research methods. The study was based on the ideas of systemic-activity approach, competency-based approach and major provisions of the theory of action. Scientific publications on research projects of PhD students and the concept of new post graduate school in the Russian education were analysed. Online survey and questionnaire survey of PhD students, their supervisors and members of dissertation boards were conducted. The assessment of results of research conducted by PhD students, synthesis and description of productive teaching practices and positive pedagogical experience gained at Tyumen State University (TSU) were applied. Results and scientific novelty. Based on the classical interpretation of nature and contents of human activity, a definition of research activity is formulated. It constitutes as the grounds for development of the contents and procedure for the list of research tasks for PhD students to master in order to successfully complete their PhD studies (as yet, the similar register has been compiled and scientifically based only for a bachelor degree). Insufficient competence of many PhD students to organise and conduct an independent scientific and pedagogical search is proved. Unstable components of their research competence are revealed: inability to use the most important elements of the methodology corpus and problems in writing scientific texts. Practically verified methods and means to develop the research competence of PhD students, doctoral candidates, applicants on academic degrees and their research supervisors are described: methodological seminars of the education department, a group analysis of scientific texts for publication, group visits and discussion of open lectures and seminars for teachers of the education department and PhD students, role mini-plays, public preliminary dissertation defense, participation in the events held by the department, etc. Practical significance. Knowledge of the gaps in research competence of PhD students will allow their supervisors to selectively improve the students' skills, which are necessary for writing and defending the dissertation. Creative application and systematically scientific-pedagogical work will help achieve a significant improvement in building PhD student competence for scientific and teaching activities.;"[Strokova, T.

Nowadays, information technologies are developing rapidly. This process affects practically all spheres of life and causes the need of system technological revolutions and modern methods of data processing. A process of digitalisation inevitably changes the structure of population employment and the educational environment as being provider of new HR-recourses. The aims of the research were to identify the problems of the digitalisation policy in Russia and to formulate possible solutions. Methodology and research methods. The methods of theoretical investigation were used: abstraction, synthesis, analysis and generalisation. Results. The interaction of education systems and science in the field of preparation of HR-recourses at the stage of digital modernisation of the Russian economy is considered. The impact of digitalisation on vacancies and competences needed and the level of preparedness of Russia for the new technological mode are analysed. The perspective directions of higher education and recruitment policy of enterprise and the whole state are identified. The authors have come to the conclusion that rational recruitment policy is an essential part of Russian economy's digitalisation. The efficiency of realisation of this strategy requires system-based approach to the organisation of staff training for the enterprises in actively changing economic conditions. HR management has become an extremely important element of this system. It is impossible to manage with such digitalisation risks as structural unemployment and - at the same time - deficit of highly-qualified specialists without paying attention to what HR-market requires. Scientific novelty. The originality of digital economy is in its optimising effect on production and consumption possible because of operativeness and consolidation of information and computing systems. There has appeared an opportunity to manage socio-economic processes systematically. The necessity of structural changes in HR-market is proved. Moreover, high schools should head the process of overcoming the expected structural unemployment caused by new technologies appearing, i.e. they provide high-quality education of specialised competencies necessary for workers, in particular. Universities must not wait for the government to work out and present new standards and recommendations. On the contrary, high schools ought to independently and urgently initiate the organisation of competitive experts training and to form innovative methods of education of new specialists by cooperating with business sphere and taking examples of digital leaders. To sum up, sensible approach to educational policy can solve the problem of balancing the HK-market and prevent social disturbance. Practical significance. On the example of activity of separate higher education institutions, the ways and models of functioning of the higher school are shown according to economic tendencies.;"[Peshkova, G.

Promotion of ideas in the agenda of public administration becomes possible through the efforts of network coalitions, whose success depends on the collective efforts of participants in managing network interaction, rather than of isolated actors. The political positions of a coalition can be weakened or strengthened by the action of external factors that are not controlled by it. Among these factors are changes in public expectations, deterioration of the economic situation, social structures operating in the political system and legislative restrictions. The success of a political coalition also depends on the promotion of new ideas, but they should be supported by the expert community and thus will have high chances of implementation in the practice of public administration. Bearers and translators of new ideas in the political and administrative system are epistemic communities - networks that unite professionals who claim to prioritize their expertise in a particular problem area. Epistemic communities are formed around specific problems that are becoming relevant in shaping the agenda. Their exceptional importance lies in the ability to create knowledge about the problem or a group of problems of interest to the decision maker. A typical example of epistemic communities is think tanks - research laboratories that create an intellectual product in various areas of public policy, which is the basis for making strategic decisions. The role of epistemic communities in the framing of the problem is due to two factors: the degree of uncertainty of the problem and the scale of the expert market. Combinations of these factors show the following possible roles: mediator, agent, advisor, shadow consultant. The influence of epistemic communities is explained by the following reasons: possession of up-to-day knowledge, ideological neutrality, non-participation in political competition.;[Mikhaylova, Olga, V] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow, Russia;Mikhaylova, OV (corresponding author), Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow, Russia.;Mikhaylova@spa.msu.ru;;;;;;9;0;0;0;2;TOMSK STATE UNIV;TOMSK;LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;1998-863X;2311-2395;;VESTN TOMSK U-FILOS;Vestn.

However, the existing diagnostic inference systems rely on knowledge bases such as ontology that are manually compiled through a labour-intensive process or automatically derived using simple pairwise statistics. We explore CBN, a Clinical Bayesian Network construction for medical ontology probabilistic inference, to learn high-quality Bayesian topology and complete ontology directly from EMRs. Specifically, we first extract medical entity relationships from over 10,000 deidentified patient records and adopt the odds ratio (OR value) calculation and the K2 greedy algorithm to automatically construct a Bayesian topology. Then, Bayesian estimation is used for the probability distribution. Finally, we employ a Bayesian network to complete the causal relationship and probability distribution of ontology to enhance the ontology inference capability. By evaluating the learned topology versus the expert opinions of physicians and entropy calculations and by calculating the ontology-based diagnosis classification, our study demonstrates that the direct and automated construction of a high-quality health topology and ontology from medical records is feasible.

Social well-being is defined as satisfaction with social benefits, integration into society as well as a subjective sense of well-being of individuals. An analysis of social well-being gives an opportunity to assess the ability of the Russian social policy to accommodate beneficiaries' needs. The empirical basis of the research includes interviews with experts, parents and children with disabilities themselves (N = 16) collected in three Russian regions, as well as data of official governmental statistics. Based on these data, the research problem is discussed around the most relevant aspects of social policy for beneficiaries that influence their social well-being such as primary and secondary education, employment, social services provision, public opinion towards children with disabilities. Certain positive changes that affected the social well-being of children with disabilities are observed at the macro-level. According to the data of all-Russian surveys and interviews, public opinion towards people with disabilities becomes more tolerant and friendly nowadays. Transformation of the social policy at the meso-system level is also observed. One of the directions of such changes leads to the development of inclusive education aimed to integrate children with disabilities into school community and society. These educational institutions put emphasis on the socialization of different categories of children, the maintenance of friendly relationships with other students as well as on the individualized approach to the educational process, taking into account children's opportunities and family demands. In this context, the level of social well-being of children with disabilities can also be increased due to a finer adjustment of the whole system and creation of a wide range of educational institutions for different categories of students particularly taking into account their ability to study. The problem of employment of children with disabilities also remains unsolved. Families of children with disabilities demonstrate certain dissatisfaction with state social services, their quality and efficiency. The healthcare system, rehabilitation services, health resort treatment as well as the accessibility of cultural objects are criticized by the informants. In this regard, non-commercial organizations and parents themselves as the micro-level agents play a significant role in increasing the social well-being of families of children with disabilities.;[Prisiazhniuk, Daria I.] Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia;Prisiazhniuk, DI (corresponding author), Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.;dprisyazhnyuk@hse.ru;;;;;;29;0;0;0;3;TOMSK STATE UNIV;TOMSK;LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;1561-7793;1561-803X;;TOMSK STATE UNIV J;Tomsk State Univ.

The range of problems affects the methodological, criminological, criminal procedural, technical and forensic, cultural and psychological aspects. The result of the study was an elaborated list of areas for the prevention of crimes of a terrorist nature affecting most scientific areas of legal knowledge. In the study, the following general scientific methods were used: analysis, synthesis, system structural. In the conducted research, the following specific scientific methods were used: biographical analysis, statistical analysis, comparative historical, expert assessment. Prevention of terrorist activity of crimes can be represented by a set of measures aimed at solving the problem in question, namely: the use of special algorithms for recording and analyzing information about the aggressive behavior of citizens using trust services; anti-criminal propaganda of terrorist crimes; victimological prevention of terrorist activity; developing plans to counter terrorist activity in civilian objects; the practice of control of public organizations; the system of population control and the system of financial sanctions for those involved in terrorist activities. The following conclusions are made in the work. (1) The use of special algorithms for fixing and analyzing information about the aggressive behavior of citizens with the help of trust services can be considered universal. (2) Antiterrorist propaganda, which is reduced to chanting universal moral values, is rather ineffective. Antiterrorist propaganda, which is reduced to mocking the image of a terrorist as a loser, has a preventive potential above average. (3) Victimological prevention is most effective at the group level, based on the typology of victims of a pronounced applied orientation. (4) Plans to counter terrorist activity at the level of instructions, schemes of training and seminars conducted should become an indispensable structural part of the documents of workflow of enterprises, organizations and institutions. (5) The practice of control of public organizations should be directed to the proper chanelling of both positive and destructive energy of their members. (6) The system of population control and the system of financial sanctions for those involved in terrorist activities are the objective realities of today, the balance found between freedom and security.";[Akhmedshin, Ramil L.] Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia;Akhmedshin, RL (corresponding author), Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia.;raist@sibmail.com;Akhmedshin, Ramil/S-6770-2019;;;;;11;0;0;0;2;TOMSK STATE UNIV;TOMSK;LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;1561-7793;1561-803X;;TOMSK STATE UNIV J;Tomsk State Univ.

These European standards allow for harmonisation in brucellosis surveillance and diagnosis while leaving some flexibility to countries in the choice of measures to meetthe desired objectives. This study reviews the bovine brucellosis surveillance systems currently in place across the European continent, according to countries' brucellosis status, based on a survey addressed to brucellosis diagnosis experts in the National Reference Laboratory of each country. Experts were asked to provide synthesised surveillance data and to describe technical conditions and screening tests carried out for the surveillance of abortions, serological testing in herds, movement controls and any other surveillance components in 2015. Results were obtained for 34 out of 37 countries (92%). Surveillance systems included abortion surveillance (34 countries), routine herd screening (28 countries), movement testing (14 countries), routine testing at bull stations (9 countries), and screening tests at slaughterhouses (4 countries). The review highlighted variability in technical conditions and screening tests among countries. These results are discussed with regard to the European Union regulations, disease risks and epidemiological situations, with the aim of improving surveillance efficacy and efficiency.;"[Henaux, V.; Siebeke, C.; Calavas, D.] Univ Lyon, French Agcy Food Environm & Occupat Hlth & Safety, Epidemiol Unit, 31 Ave Tony Garnier, F-69364 Lyon 07, France; [Jay, M.; Ponsart, C.] Paris Est Univ, French Agcy Food Environm & Occupat Hlth & Safety, Anim Hlth Lab,EU, Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO,World Org Anim, 14 Rue Pierre & Marie Curie, F-94701 Maisons Alfort, France; [Jay, M.; Ponsart, C.] Natl Reference Lab Brucellosis, 14 Rue Pierre & Marie Curie, F-94701 Maisons Alfort, France";Henaux, V (corresponding author), Univ Lyon, French Agcy Food Environm & Occupat Hlth & Safety, Epidemiol Unit, 31 Ave Tony Garnier, F-69364 Lyon 07, France.;viviane.henaux@anses.fr;;Ponsart, Claire/0000-0002-9633-4464;;;;47;0;0;0;8;OFFICE INT EPIZOOTIES;PARIS;12 RUE DE PRONY, 75017 PARIS, FRANCE;0253-1933;;;REV SCI TECH OIE;Rev.

Unfortunately, clinical gestalt and currently available clinical scoring systems lack the optimal accuracy to prevent blood product wastage (through overactivation), as well as individual patient morbidity and mortality (through under-activation). In order to help refine the MTP activation criteria and protocols, we surveyed clinicians on acceptable over- and under-activation rates for massive transfusions. Methods We surveyed Canadian content experts in their respective fields, using a snowball survey technique. Respondents were categorized into two groups: Group 1 was comprised of trauma and acute care specialists (TACS), while Group 2 was comprised of clinical and laboratory medicine specialists (CLMS). Between-group differences were examined using Fisher's exact test and the likelihood ratio. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results We received responses from 35 clinicians in the TACS group and 10 clinicians in the CLMS group. About half (45.7%) of respondents in the TACS group considered an MTP overactivation rate of 5% - 10% acceptable (vs. 60% of the CLMS group; not significant (NS)). Approximately one-third (34.2%) of the respondents in the TACS group considered an MTP under-activation rate of less than 5% acceptable, whereas the majority (60%) of respondents in the CLMS group considered an under-activation rate of less than 5% acceptable (NS). A significantly greater proportion of respondents in the TACS group felt that an anticipated need for > 20 units of packed red blood cells within the next 24 hours was an acceptable criterion for MTP activation. Respondents in the CLMS group were more likely to consider poor communication as a reason for blood component wastage. Conclusion Similarities in acceptable MTP over- and under-activation rates were noted across specialties.

This research questions the job security of professional service workers in healthcare, higher education, legal services, and management. Specifically, we explore the potential for new and advanced information technologies to allow lower-paid employees to do the work of service professionals. We do this by empirically analyzing job characteristics that might justify the higher pay of professional service jobs and then evaluating whether those characteristics are truly distinctive of professionals. We consider job characteristics pertaining to low task structure and high decision impact, which theory suggests inhibit automation and justify professional training. Specific contributions of the research include (1) a model depicting three modes by which advanced information technologies (expert systems) impact professional service jobs, (2) clarification of what is meant by professional service in a way that we can operationalize empirically, (3) hypotheses about characteristics of professional service jobs that might justify higher pay, and (4) tests of the hypotheses across and between the aforementioned professional service job categories. Results show that professional service jobs are distinct according to the considered job characteristics but that the distinctions are not universal across industries. Healthcare professions are the most distinctive on these characteristics and, thus, are seemingly less likely to be disrupted. Professional jobs in education, legal services, and management are less distinctive and, thus, more susceptible to be taken over by less-trained and lower-paid workers supported with advanced technologies.;[Sampsona, Scott E.] Brigham Young Univ, Marriott Sch Business, Provo, UT 84602 USA;Sampsona, SE (corresponding author), Brigham Young Univ, Marriott Sch Business, Provo, UT 84602 USA.;sampson-article@byu.edu;;;;;;89;1;1;7;11;INFORMS;CATONSVILLE;5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA;2164-3962;2164-3970;;SERV SCI;Serv.

Breaking with this tradition, we present a series of case studies in a book written by key policymakers, scholars and experts, looking at health systems and their projected successes to 2030. Healthcare Systems: Future Predictions for Global Care includes chapters on 52 individual countries and five regions, covering a total of 152 countries. Synthesised, two key contributions are made in this compendium. First, five trends shaping the future healthcare landscape are analysed: sustainable health systems; the genomics revolution; emerging technologies; global demographics dynamics; and new models of care. Second, nine main themes arise from the chapters: integration of healthcare services; financing, economics and insurance; patient-based care and empowering the patient; universal healthcare; technology and information technology; aging populations; preventative care; accreditation, standards, and policy; and human development, education and training. These five trends and nine themes can be used as a blueprint for change. They can help strengthen the efforts of stakeholders interested in reform, ranging from international bodies such as the World Health Organization, the International Society for Quality in Health Care and the World Bank, through to national bodies such as health departments, quality and safety agencies, non-government organisations (NGO) and other groups with an interest in improving healthcare delivery systems. This compendium offers more than a glimpse into the future of healthcare-it provides a roadmap to help shape thinking about the next generation of caring systems, extrapolated over the next 15 years.";"[Braithwaite, Jeffrey; Mannion, Russell; Matsuyama, Yukihiro; Al-Adawi, Samir; Ludlow, Kristiana; James, Wendy; Ting, Hsuen P.; Herkes, Jessica; McPherson, Elise; Churruca, Kate; Lamprell, Gina; Ellis, Louise A.; Boyling, Claire; Warwick, Meagan; Pomare, Chiara; Hughes, Clifford F.] Macquarie Univ, Australian Inst Hlth Innovat, Ctr Healthcare Resilience & Implementat Sci, Level 6,75 Talavera Rd, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Braithwaite, Jeffrey; Mannion, Russell] Univ Birmingham, HSMC, Pk House,40 Edgbaston Pk Rd, Birmingham B15 2RT, W Midlands, England; [Braithwaite, Jeffrey; Matsuyama, Yukihiro] Canon Inst Global Studies, Chiyoda Ku, 11th Floor, Tokyo 1006511, Japan; [Braithwaite, Jeffrey; Nicklin, Wendy; Hughes, Clifford F.] Int Soc Qual Hlth Care ISQua, 4th Floor,Huguenot House,35-38 St Stephens Green, Dublin D02 NY63 2, Ireland; [Matsuyama, Yukihiro] Chiba Univ Commerce, 1-3-1 Konodai, Ichikawa, Chiba 2728512, Japan; [Shekelle, Paul G.] VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare Syst, 1301 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90073 USA; [Whittaker, Stuart] Univ Cape Town, Observ Rondebosch, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth & Family Med, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa; [Al-Adawi, Samir] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Med & Hlth Sci, POB 35, Muscat 123, Oman";Herkes, J (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Australian Inst Hlth Innovat, Ctr Healthcare Resilience & Implementat Sci, Level 6,75 Talavera Rd, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.;jeffrey.braithwaite@mq.edu.au;"Pomare, Chiara/AAE-8472-2019; Braithwaite, Jeffrey/AAN-1467-2020; Al-Adawi, Samir/A-9663-2016; Ludlow, Kristiana/AAE-5220-2019";"Pomare, Chiara/0000-0002-9118-7207; Braithwaite, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0296-4957; Al-Adawi, Samir/0000-0002-9858-5582; Ludlow, Kristiana/0000-0001-7284-5625; Boyling, Claire/0000-0002-5721-3993; Ellis, Louise/0000-0001-6902-4578; Warwick, Meagan/0000-0001-8337-2181; Churruca, Kate/0000-0002-9923-3116";"Australian Institute of Health Innovation; National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia; Australian Research Council (ARC)Australian Research Council; NHMRCNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [9100002]; Macquarie University";This work was supported by the Australian Institute of Health Innovation, which receives 80% of its core funding from category one, peer-reviewed grants, chiefly, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and Australian Research Council (ARC) funding, which includes, most recently, the NHMRC Partnership Grant for Health Systems Sustainability (ID: 9100002).

Attempts to automate this process have been hampered by the complexity of PSG signals and physiological heterogeneity between patients. Deep neural networks, which have recently achieved expert-level performance for other complex medical tasks, are ideally suited to PSG scoring, given sufficient training data. Methods: We used a combination of deep recurrent and convolutional neural networks (RCNN) for supervised learning of clinical labels designating sleep stages, sleep apnea events, and limb movements. The data for testing and training were derived from 10 000 clinical PSGs and 5804 research PSGs. Results: When trained on the clinical dataset, the RCNN reproduces PSG diagnostic scoring for sleep staging, sleep apnea, and limb movements with accuracies of 87.6%, 88.2% and 84.7% on held-out test data, a level of performance comparable to human experts. The RCNN model performs equally well when tested on the independent research PSG database. Only small reductions in accuracy were noted when training on limited channels to mimic at-home monitoring devices: frontal leads only for sleep staging, and thoracic belt signals only for the apnea-hypopnea index. Conclusions: By creating accurate deep learning models for sleep scoring, our work opens the path toward broader and more timely access to sleep diagnostics. Accurate scoring automation can improve the utility and efficiency of in-lab and at-home approaches to sleep diagnostics, potentially extending the reach of sleep expertise beyond specialty clinics.;"[Biswal, Siddharth; Sun, Jimeng] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Computat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Sun, Haoqi; Goparaju, Balaji; Westover, M.

Our proposed online algorithm falls into the class of weighted average predictors and uses a time-varying multiplicative weight update rule. This update rule changes the weight of an expert based on his or her relative performance compared to the average performance of available experts at the current round. This makes the algorithm suitable for recommendation systems in the presence of an adversary with many potential applications in the new emerging area of the Internet of Things. We prove the convergence of our algorithm to the best expert, defined in terms of both availability and accuracy, in the stochastic setting. In particular, we show the applicability of our definition of best expert through convergence analysis of another well-known algorithm in this setting. Finally, through simulation results on synthetic and real datasets, we justify the out-performance of our proposed algorithms compared to the existing ones in the literature.;"[Truong, Anh; Etesami, S.

The index system contained 12 indicators in technology, economy and environment. Based on the analytic hierarchy process, a remanufacturing evaluation hierarchy structural model was established. In particular, a remanufacturing evaluation dot matrix model was established combined with experts grading method. In the model, the results of experts grading were visualized, and then each evaluation index was quantified. The weight and influence coefficient of the index were calculated, and the remanufacturing evaluation composite index was obtained. Taking a long steam turbine blade as an example, the remanufacturing evaluation composite index was calculated to be 0.83, indicating that the blade has good remanufacturability.

Using these methods, the remaining life of an aged RC-T girder bridge (SK-bridge) can be quantitatively estimated by applying the bridge rating expert (BREX) system, which is a subsystem of the J-BMS RC version that incorporates with the field inspection data. In this study, close visual inspection was carried out on the aged bridge by professional visual inspectors, during which all variations of the inspection results were evaluated using a five-step questionnaire. As a result, it was found that the soundness score (safety index) and remaining life predictions were influenced by the learning (supervised) data selection.

However, a common choice of indicators is rarely emphasized and it is almost impossible to adopt such indicators due to the different biophysical and geographical conditions of different countries and regions. Similarly, suggesting a common choice of indicators for tea farming appears quite challenging. This study was designed to develop a set of indicators for tea farming by considering the site-specific features. The methodological steps followed in this study were as follows: i) defining a number of possible factors based on the regional characteristics and life patterns of the people, (ii) defining the selection criteria and the validation procedures of the indicators, and (iii) selecting the directly usable indicators from previous farm-level sustainability studies. Self-validation, scientific validation, and social validation were performed. Expert's opinion and stakeholders' participation were found to play a vital role in the validation and selection of the indicators. The data availability and scoring methods were also discussed. As a result, we developed a user-friendly methodology for selecting indicators and scoring methods for the qualitative indicators. The set of indicators identified in this study is totally site-specific.

In the absence of such data, the experience of researchers can be used to inform decision making on monitoring design to detect impacts of climate change. We used expert elicitation to identify ecological traits of seabirds and marine mammals that have or were expected to respond to climate change. We analyzed the projected biological changes for five general categories of ecological traits that have been shown elsewhere to relate to climate signals: foraging and diet, body mass, breeding phenology, breeding success, and population size. Based on analysis of 106 traits in the five categories, 29 experts rated foraging-and diet-related traits to be the most responsive to climate change, although predictions for traits in this category were also the most variable across experts. Body mass related traits were projected to change almost as frequently, but with much lower variance. The timespan over which experts expected to see change also varied between trait categories. Foraging success was expected to respond most quickly. Considering sensitivity and response rate, we predict that the duration of foraging trips will be the best climate change indicator among the 106 traits. When combined with cost estimates, our results allow managers to choose ecological indicators that deliver information on system response in the most cost-effective manner.;"[Wilcox, Chris; Hobday, Alistair J.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, GPO Box 1538, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Chambers, Lynda E.] Bur Meteorol, GPO Box 1289, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia";Wilcox, C (corresponding author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, GPO Box 1538, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.;"chris.wilcox@csiro.au; alistair.hobday@csiro.au; phenologist@gmail.com";;;"FRDC - DCCEE, the Australian Government; CSIRO Climate Adaptation FlagshipCommonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)";We appreciate the responses of all the experts that generated the data set examined here.

This study aimed to develop an endoscopic severity score of UC for CCE-2. Methods: Patients diagnosed with UC were enrolled prospectively and underwent colonoscopy and CCE-2 on the same day. The collected CCE-2 videos were adopted for the development of the score. These videos were scored by 4 blinded inflammatory bowel disease experts. The items validated with the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) were used as the candidate items, some of which were automatically assessed using the workstation. Each item was divided into proximal and distal parts at the splenic flexure and then individually assessed. The image readers simultaneously evaluated the inflammation severity using the visual analog scale (VAS). The descriptors that contribute to this scale were evaluated, and a model to predict the VAS was constructed. The UCEIS was scored by other endoscopists using colonoscopy videos. The correlation coefficients with fecal calprotectin, blood tests, and Lichtiger index were calculated. Results: The final scoring system was fixed as vascular pattern sum (proximal + distal) + bleeding sum + erosions and ulcers sum (minimum-maximum, 0-14) and was named Capsule Scoring of Ulcerative Colitis (CSUC). The correlation coefficient of CSUC with biomarkers and clinical score was similar to that of the UCEIS. Conclusions: We developed a new simple score using the 3 descriptors of CCE-2.;"[Hosoe, Naoki; Nakazato, Yoshihiro; Ogata, Haruhiko] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Diagnost & Therapeut Endoscopy, Tokyo, Japan; [Nakano, Masaru; Kobayashi, Taku; Hibi, Toshifumi] Kitasato Univ, Kitasato Inst Hosp, Ctr Adv IBD Res & Treatment, Tokyo, Japan; [Takeuchi, Ken; Suzuki, Yasuo] Toho Univ, Sakura Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Chiba, Japan; [Endo, Yutaka; Yoshida, Atsushi; Ueno, Fumiaki] Ofuna Chuo Hosp, Ctr Gastroenterol & Inflammatory Bowel Dis, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan; [Matsuoka, Katsuyoshi; Watanabe, Mamoru] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Tokyo, Japan; [Abe, Takayuki] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Clin Res, Dept Prevent Med & Publ Hlth,Biostat, Tokyo, Japan; [Omori, Teppei] Tokyo Womens Med Univ, Inst Gastroenterol, Tokyo, Japan; [Hayashida, Mari] Kyorin Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med 3, Tokyo, Japan; [Mizuno, Shinta; Naganuma, Makoto; Kanai, Takanori] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Tokyo, Japan";Ogata, H (corresponding author), Keio Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Diagnost & Therapeut Endoscopy, Shinjuku Ku, 35 Shinanomachi, Tokyo 1608582, Japan.;hogata@keio.jp;"Kobayashi, Taku/AAO-6437-2020; Omori, Teppei/AAM-6399-2020";"Kobayashi, Taku/0000-0002-2073-4234; Omori, Teppei/0000-0002-9959-5168; Kanai, Takanori/0000-0002-1466-4532";MedtronicMedtronic;This independent research was supported by a funding contribution from Medtronic.;;22;4;4;0;1;OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC;CARY;JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA;1078-0998;1536-4844;;INFLAMM BOWEL DIS;Inflamm.

To satisfy information needs, users mostly submit a query via traditional search engines, which retrieve results on the basis of keyword matching principle. However, a keyword-based search cannot recognize the meanings of keywords and the semantic relationship among the terms in the user's query; thus, this technique cannot retrieve satisfactory results. The expansion of an initial query with relevant meaningful terms can solve this issue and enhance information retrieval. Generally, query expansion methods consider concepts that are semantically related to query terms within the ontology as candidates in expanding the initial query. An analysis of the correct sense of query terms, rather than only considering semantic relations, is necessary to overcome language ambiguity problems. In this work, we proposed a query expansion framework on the basis of query sense analysis and semantics mining using computer science domain ontology, followed by working prototype of the system. The experts analyzed the results of system prototype over test dataset and Web data, and found a remarkable improvement in the overall search performance.

The level of similarity of each similar case was calculated using weighted Minkowski method. Cases with the highest level of similarity would be adopted as new case solutions. If the value of similarity was < 0,8, the revision would be conducted by an expert. The tests result conducted by the expert showed that the system was able to perform the diagnosis correctly.

Existing practices by organizations even with the assistance of security tools and appliances is mostly manual in nature as there is still a need for a human expert to interpret and map the reports generated by various solutions to actual requirements as stated in various compliance documents. As the number of requirements increases, this process is becoming either too costly or impractical to manage by the organization. Aside from the numerous requirements, multiple of these documents actually overlap in terms of domains and actual requirements. However, since current tools do not directly map and highlight overlaps as well as generate detailed gap reports, an organization would perform compliance activities redundantly across multiple requirements thereby increasing cost as well. In this paper, we present an approach that attempts to provide an end-to-end solution from compliance document requirements to actual verification and validation of implementation for audit purposes with the intention of automating compliance status monitoring as well as providing the ability to have continuous compliance monitoring as well as reducing the redundant efforts that an organization embarks on for multiple compliance requirements. This research thru enhancing existing security ontologies to model compliance documents and applying information extraction practices would allow for overlapping requirements to be identified and gaps to be clearly explained to the organization. Thru the use of secure systems development lifecycle, and heuristics the research also provide a mechanism to automate the technical validation of compliance statuses thereby allowing for continuous monitoring as well as mapping to the enhanced ontology to allow reusability via conceptual mapping of multiple standards and requirements. Practices such as unit testing and continuous integration from secure systems development life cycle are incorporated to allow for flexibility of the automation process while at the same time using it to support the mapping between compliance requirements.;"[Cheng, Danny C.; Villamarin, Jod B.; Cu, Gregory; Lim-Cheng, Nathalie Rose] De La Salle Univ, Coll Comp Studies, Manila, Philippines";Cheng, DC (corresponding author), De La Salle Univ, Coll Comp Studies, Manila, Philippines.;;;;University Research Coordination Office (URCO) of De La Salle University Manila;This research is partly funded by the University Research Coordination Office (URCO) of De La Salle University Manila and was conducted with the assistance of research assistant Julie Ann Salido.;;14;1;1;0;0;SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD;WEST YORKSHIRE;19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND;2158-107X;2156-5570;;INT J ADV COMPUT SC;Int.

A common approach involves developing voluntary agreements with industry or allowing them to self-regulate. In England, the most recent example of this was the Public Health Responsibility Deal (RD), a public-private partnership launched in 2011 under the then Conservative-led coalition government. The RD was organised around a series of voluntary agreements that aim to bring together government, academic experts, and commercial, public sector and voluntary organisations to commit to pledges to undertake actions of public health benefit. This paper brings together the main findings and implications of the evaluation of the RD using a systems approach. We analysed the functioning of the RD exploring the causal pathways involved and how they helped or hindered the RD; the structures and processes; feedback loops and how they might have constrained or potentiated the effects of the RD; and how resilient the wider systems were to change (i.e., the alcohol, food, and other systems interacted with). Both the production and uptake of pledges by RD partners were largely driven by the interests of partners themselves, enabling these wider systems to resist change. This analysis demonstrates how and why the RD did not meet its objectives. The findings have lessons for the development of effective alcohol, food and other policies, for defining the role of unhealthy commodity industries, and for understanding the limits of industry self-regulation as a public health measure.";"[Knai, Cecile; Petticrew, Mark; Douglas, Nick; Durand, Mary Alison; Eastmure, Elizabeth; Nolte, Ellen; Mays, Nicholas] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Publ Hlth & Policy, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England";Knai, C (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Publ Hlth & Policy, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England.;"cecile.knai@lshtm.ac.uk; mark.petticrew@lshtm.ac.uk; nick.douglas@lshtm.ac.uk; mary-alison.durand@lshtm.ac.uk; elizabeth.eastmure@lshtm.ac.uk; ellen.nolte@lshtm.ac.uk; nicholas.mays@lshtm.ac.uk";;"Durand, Mary Alison/0000-0003-2205-4002; Eastmure, Elizabeth/0000-0001-6796-3707; Knai, Cecile/0000-0001-6663-7379";Policy Research Programme of the Department of Health and Social Care for England [1020001];This work is funded by the Policy Research Programme of the Department of Health and Social Care for England (grant number 1020001) via its core support for the Policy Research Unit in Policy Innovation Research.;;34;16;16;0;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;1660-4601;;;INT J ENV RES PUB HE;Int.

The aim of this paper is to present a novel methodology designed for quantifying relevant information provided by different participants in clinical online discussions. The main goal of the methodology is to facilitate the comparison of participant interactions in clinical conversations. A set of key indicators for different aspects of clinical conversations and specific clinical contributions within a discussion have been defined. Particularly, three new indicators have been proposed to make use of biomedical knowledge extraction based on standard terminologies and ontologies. These indicators allow measuring the relevance of information of each participant of the clinical conversation. Proposed indicators have been applied to one discussion extracted from PatientsLikeMe, as well as to two real clinical cases from the Sanar collaborative discussion system. Results obtained from indicators in the tested cases have been compared with clinical expert opinions to check indicators validity. The methodology has been successfully used for describing participant interactions in real clinical cases belonging to a collaborative clinical case discussion tool and from a conversation from a health social network.

Four climate-sensitive diseases of primary concern are described in the study: acute respiratory infections (ARI), diarrhea, malnutrition, and malaria. Baseline conditions of these four diseases from 2000 to 2014 show acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases are increasing in incidence; while incidence of malnutrition and malaria decreased over this period.

We capture this continuing influence, which can collide with the exiting state's intended goal of regaining control over specific issues, with a theoretical framework based on juridification as a socio-legal concept of systems theory in the international legal context. The aim is to explain the endogenous process of legal growth within the IO via bureaucratisation and expert rule, which eventually affects the norms of the wider legal regime where the IO operates. With three case studies of IO exits, we illustrate the continuation of normative structures promoted directly or indirectly by the IO, according to two legal techniques of juridification: third-party interpretation on the one hand, and the extended reach of norms and processes through the work of non-state actors on the other. Overall, widening the theoretical perspective on state exits under systems theory can lead to more complete judgements on the tensions between domestic and supranational systems in the expansion of global normative regimes.;"[Kang-Riou, Nicolas; Rossati, David] Univ Salford, Law, Salford, Lancs, England";Kang-Riou, N (corresponding author), Univ Salford, Law, Salford, Lancs, England.;"n.kang-riou@salford.ac.uk; d.rossati@salford.ac.uk";;Kang-Riou, Nicolas/0000-0002-8688-2336;;;;102;0;0;0;2;BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS;LEIDEN;PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS;1572-3739;1572-3747;;INT ORGAN LAW REV;Int.

Schools are one of the institutions with greater relevance in the detection of the child sexual abuse, as well as in the protection of the victims, since they allow a planned and systematic intervention with all the students. However, the studies on the actions of the teaching staff in the case of child sexual abuse in the educational field show the enormous mismatch between what should be the ideal role of professionals in the educational sphere, in the child protection system, and conceptions and their behaviors in cases of maltreatment children. This article presents the results of a research on the knowledge, detection and confrontation of child sexual abuse in secondary school teachers in Galicia. Forty-four questionnaires have been exploited and these quantitative results have been completed with three in-depth interviews with experts in school counseling.;"[Fontarigo, Rosa Rua; Perez-Lahoz, Violeta] Univ Vigo, Orense, Spain; [Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Ruben] Univ Vigo, Dept Anal & Intervenc Psicosocioeduc, Orense, Spain";Fontarigo, RR (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Orense, Spain.;"ruafontarigo@edu.xunta.es; violeta.perez.lahoz@gmail.com; rubgonzalez@uvigo.es";Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Ruben/M-6437-2015;Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Ruben/0000-0003-1806-1103;;;;57;0;0;0;5;FUNDACION IS&D INVESTIGACION SOCIAL AVANZADA;LAS MATAS;CALLE ZALAMEA 1, LAS MATAS, 00000, SPAIN;1989-3469;;;PRISM SOC;Prism.

Access to bariatric support groups is sometimes challenging, leading people to seek support on social media platforms like Facebook. Given the ubiquity of recommendations solicited and provided on Facebook regarding nutrition and bariatric surgery, understanding the content and accuracy of these posts is important. Objectives: The primary aim of the present study was to describe the content of nutrition-related information sought on bariatric Facebook support groups/pages. A secondary aim was to evaluate the accuracy of this content. Setting: Integrated multispecialty health system. Methods: An iterative content analysis process was conducted and resulted in identification of 8 primary coding themes. Additionally, 3 registered dieticians with extensive experience in bariatric surgery and obesity treatment examined posts that provided nutritional recommendations to determine accuracy. Results: Members most commonly sought advice regarding products and practices to assist in achieving nutritional guidelines (35%). Over half of the posts contained inaccurate content or information that was too ambiguous to determine accuracy; 7% of posts were found to be inaccurate or inconsistent with American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery nutrition guidelines and expert registered dietician opinions, 22% of posts were found to contain both accurate and inaccurate information, and 24% of posts were considered too ambiguous and required more context to determine the accuracy. Conclusions: Results highlight the need for bariatric programs to provide greater nutrition education support to patients postoperatively and to provide caution about the inconsistent nature of some nutrition-related content found on Facebook bariatric support groups.

In addition to the exercise specialists, the athlete's team frequently includes psychologists (who address performance anxiety, stress, and depression), counselors (who address smoking cessation, reduction or elimination of alcohol consumption if necessary, weight optimization, and optimal sleep), and nutritionists (who address optimal nutrition and body mass attributes). Such a collaborative approach has become standard practice for athletes aiming to excel in their sports. Despite unequivocal and compelling evidence, this paradigm has only weakly been transferred to the needs of patients participating in rehabilitation programs. These individuals, like the athlete, also need to achieve their highest level of functional performance and recovery for carrying out their activities of daily living, managing the needs of their families, and often returning to work. This article reviews the evidence-based literature and the implications of this multifaceted approach in rehabilitation programs. The augmented benefits to exercise training and conditioning (prescriptive activity/exercise and less sitting) along with their 'effect sizes' are described in the rehabilitation context, in conjunction with smoking cessation, reduced harmful alcohol consumption, optimal nutrition, optimal body mass, manageable stress, and optimal sleep. These factors can be viewed as physical performance enhancers both in individuals participating in rehabilitation whose aim is maximal performance and recovery and in athletes aiming for maximal performance in their sports. Thus, without targeted attention to these lifestyle factors, rehabilitation outcomes cannot be maximized. The evidence presented in this article has implications for health professionals including physical therapists and others who are practicing in rehabilitation settings and those working with individuals in need in the community.;[Dean, Elizabeth] Univ British Columbia, Dept Phys Therapy, Fac Med, Vancouver, BC, Canada;Dean, E (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, 212,Friedman Bldg,2177 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.;elizabeth.dean@ubc.ca;;;;;;45;1;1;0;0;DE GRUYTER POLAND SP ZOO;WARSAW;BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR., 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND;1640-5544;1899-7562;;J HUM KINET;J.

Therefore, in the actual industrial field, a systematic design method is required to improve the efficiency of process design. Development of such a method will result in a reduction in production cost and time. In this study, a process design system that can be installed in AutoCAD V14 was developed. By using the developed design system, the drawing load, stress, and strain, among other parameters, can be calculated. In addition, intermediate die shapes can be designed. After the process design, both process information and drawings of dies can be obtained.

However, evaluation is necessary to determine if the activities had an impact on quality of care and resulted in system-wide change. Clinical networks of health providers aim to provide a platform for accelerating quality improvement activities and adopting evidence based practices. However, most networks do not collect primary data that would enable evaluation of impact. We adapted an established expert panel approach to measure the impacts of efforts in 19 clinical networks to improve care and promote health system change, to determine whether these efforts achieved their purpose. Study type: A retrospective cross-sectional study of 19 clinical networks using multiple methods of data collection including the EXpert PANel Decision (EXPAND) method. Methods: Network impacts were identified through interviews with network managers (n = 19) and co-chairs (n = 32), and document review. The EXPAND method brought together five independent experts who provided initial individual ratings of overall network impact. After attendance at an in-person moderated meeting where aggregate scores were discussed, the experts provided a final rating. Median scores of postmeeting ratings were the final measures of network impact. Results: Among the 19 clinical networks, experts rated 47% (n = 9) as having a limited impact on improving quality of care, 37% (n = 7) as having a moderate impact and 16% (n = 3) as having a high impact. The experts rated 26% (n = 5) of clinical networks as having a limited impact on facilitating system-wide change, 37% (n = 7) as having a moderate impact and 37% (n = 7) as having a high impact. Conclusion: The EXPAND method enabled appraisal of diverse clinical networks in the absence of primary data that could directly evaluate network impacts. The EXPAND method can be applied to assess the impact of quality improvement initiatives across diverse clinical areas to inform healthcare planning, delivery and performance. Further research is needed to assess its reliability and validity.;"[Dominello, Amanda; Klineberg, Emily; Redman, Sally; Brown, Bernadette; Kalucy, Deanna; Haines, Mary] Sax Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Dominello, Amanda; Craig, Jonathan C.; Haines, Mary] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Yano, Elizabeth M.] VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare Syst, VA HSR&D Ctr Study Healthcare Innovat Implement &, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Yano, Elizabeth M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Los Angeles, CA USA";"Dominello, A (corresponding author), Sax Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Dominello, A (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia.";amanda.dominello@saxinstitute.org.au;Craig, Jonathan/AAR-1768-2020;Craig, Jonathan/0000-0002-2548-4035;"National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC)National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [571447]; Agency for Clinical Innovation as part of the NHMRC partnership project grant scheme";This research was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC) through its partnership project grant scheme (Grant ID: 571447).

There is emerging evidence that these clinical networks can drive quality improvement programs, but the features that distinguish successful networks are largely unknown. We examined the factors that make clinical networks effective at improving quality of care and facilitating system-wide changes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of 19 state-wide clinical networks that reflected a range of medical and surgical specialty care and were in operation from 2006 to 2008 in New South Wales, Australia. We conducted qualitative interviews with network leaders to characterise potential impacts, and conducted internet surveys of network members to evaluate external support and the organisational and program characteristics of their respective networks. The main outcome measures were median ratings of individual network impacts on quality of care and system-wide changes, determined through independent assessment of documented evidence by an expert panel. Results: We interviewed 19 network managers and 32 network co-chairs; 592 network members completed internet surveys. Three networks were rated as having had high impact on quality of care, and seven as having had high impact on system-wide change. Better-perceived strategic and operational network management was significantly associated with higher ratings of impact on quality of care (coefficient estimate 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02, 1.69). Better-perceived leadership of the network manager (coefficient estimate 0.47; 95% CI 0.10, 0.85) and strategic and operational network management (coefficient estimate 0.23; 95% CI 0.06, 0.41) were associated with higher ratings of impact on system-wide change. Conclusions: This study represents the largest study of clinical networks undertaken to date. The results suggest that clinical networks that span the health system can improve quality of care and facilitate system-wide change. Network management and leadership, encompassing both strategic and operational elements at the organisational level, appear to be the primary influences on network success. These findings can guide future organisational and system-wide change programs and the development or strengthening of clinical networks to help implement evidence based care to improve service delivery and outcomes.";"[Haines, Mary M.; Brown, Bernadette; Dominello, Amanda; Klineberg, Emily; Atkinson, Jo-An; Redman, Sally] Sax Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Haines, Mary M.; Craig, Jonathan C.; Castaldi, Peter A.; Pollock, Carol A.; Elliott, Elizabeth J.; Dominello, Amanda] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [D'Este, Catherine A.] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Hlth & Med, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [D'Este, Catherine A.; Paul, Christine] Univ Newcastle, Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Callaghan, NSW, Australia; [Yano, Elizabeth M.] VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare Syst, VA HSR&D Ctr Study Healthcare Innovat Implementat, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Yano, Elizabeth M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Middleton, Sandy] St Vincents Hlth, Nursing Res Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Middleton, Sandy] Australian Catholic Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Castaldi, Peter A.; Needham, Kate; Watt, William H.] Agcy Clin Innovat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Watt, William H.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Med, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Scott, Anthony] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia";"Haines, MM (corresponding author), Sax Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Haines, MM (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia.";mary.haines@saxinstitute.org.au;"Scott, Anthony/E-6636-2010; Craig, Jonathan/AAR-1768-2020; Middleton, Sandy/J-5526-2015; Occhipinti, Jo-An/AAA-3870-2021; McInnes, Professor Elizabeth/R-6374-2019";"Scott, Anthony/0000-0002-2851-5378; Craig, Jonathan/0000-0002-2548-4035; Middleton, Sandy/0000-0002-7201-4394; Occhipinti, Jo-An/0000-0002-2380-1092; McInnes, Professor Elizabeth/0000-0002-0567-9679; Elliott, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6501-5487";;;;25;2;2;0;5;SAX INST;ULTIMO;LEVEL 13, BUILDING 10, 235 JONES ST, ULTIMO, NSW 2007, AUSTRALIA;2204-2091;;;PUBLIC HEALTH RES PR;Public Health Res.

International protection standards and guidelines request, that both radiological and non-radiological health consequences have to be considered in preparedness and response to an actual emergency and there is a need to broaden the radiation protection system's philosophy beyond the metrics of radioactivity and radiation dose. During the past decade a number of multidisciplinary projects were set up with the aim of evaluating management options according to social, economic and ethical criteria, in addition to technical feasibility to achieve this goal. WHO and partners from the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Task Force on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings have developed a comprehensive framework and guidelines, which can be applied to any type of an emergency or disaster regardless of its origin. There is a need to include the available scientific expertise and the technical, managerial and personal resources to be considered within a similar 'decision framework' that will apply to radiation emergencies. Key areas of the required expertise needed to develop such a framework are radiation protection, medical support (especially primary care and emergency medicine, mental health support), social sciences (anthropology, psychology, ethics) and communications experts. The implementation of such a multidisciplinary concept in the operational world requires education and training well beyond the level currently available.;"[Carr, Z.] WHO, Dept Publ Hlth Environm & Social Determinants Hlt, Geneva, Switzerland; [Maeda, M.] Fukushima Med Univ, Fukushima, Japan; [Oughton, D.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Ctr Environm Radioact CERAD, As, Norway; [Weiss, W.] Holderlinstr 31, D-79312 Emmendingen, Germany";Weiss, W (corresponding author), Holderlinstr 31, D-79312 Emmendingen, Germany.;wolfgang.weiss1@googlemail.com;;;World Health OrganizationWorld Health Organization [001] Funding Source: Medline;;;18;4;4;0;5;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0144-8420;1742-3406;;RADIAT PROT DOSIM;Radiat.

For this purpose, the surface currents and wind parameters were generated by selected numerical models and the wind parameters were also measured with the telemetry devices. In this paper, the PM3D hydrodynamic model and the NEMS, ECMWF, GFS weather forecast models have been investigated. The measurements of the wind parameters, recorded at the Brama Torowa I and Trzebiez stations, were also analyzed. As part of the research, an expert method was used to evaluate the surface currents parameters. In turn, the method based on comparing the forecasted wind parameters with the measured wind parameters was applied in order to assess uncertainties of these parameters. The comparative analyses of the data on the surface currents and wind parameters have been done and probabilistic models for uncertainties of these forecasted parameters have been formulated. Additionally, relations between the surface currents speeds and the wind speeds, in the case when their directions were consistent, have been also discovered.;"[Kijewska, M.; Pleskacz, K.; Kasyk, L.] Maritime Univ Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland";Kijewska, M (corresponding author), Maritime Univ Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland.;;"Pleskacz, Krzysztof/AAD-2937-2020; Kijewska, Monika/AAD-6320-2020";"Pleskacz, Krzysztof/0000-0002-4296-1243; Kijewska, Monika/0000-0002-7429-2507; Kasyk, Lech/0000-0002-4719-0695";Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [4/S/INM/15];This research outcome has been achieved under the grant No 4/S/INM/15 finansed from a subsidy of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education for statutory activities.;;23;0;0;1;2;GDYNIA MARITIME UNIV, FAC NAVIGATION;GDYNIA;3, JOHN PAUL II AVE, GDYNIA, 81-345, POLAND;2083-6473;2083-6481;;TRANSNAV;TransNav;DEC;2018;12;4;;;;;729;737;;10.12716/1001.12.04.12;;;9;Transportation Science & Technology;Transportation;HI2WD;WOS:000456306200012;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-02-18;

Water resources, the subject of this paper, require sustainable management to provide drinking water for society, habitat and ecological water for the environment, and a myriad of industrial water uses, including agriculture, power generation, and manufacturing. In addition to technologies that increase water supply or reduce demand, the effective management of data, specific to water resources, will be crucial in the immediate and long-term future. With diverse water data generators, collectors, synthesizers, users, and policymakers, an integrated system of water data management has potential to ensure sustainable water resource management. To bring this potential to fruition, this work synthesizes published recommendations, as well as those of water experts, and best practices from examples of water data management to provide a preliminary assessment for larger ongoing efforts to improve data for water decision-making in California. Stakeholder collaboration, data standardization, increased data collection, and data transparency and accessibility are among the most common and most important recommendations for sustainably developing and managing an integrated water data management system.;"[Mayton, Holly M.; Story, S.

In pursuing both goals, they have to conciliate coexisting, not always aligned, realities. Methods This paper originated from a workshop entitled 'Health systems for the future' held at the European Parliament. Experts and decision makers were asked to discuss measures that may increase the effectiveness and sustainability of health systems, namely: (i) increasing citizens' participation; (ii) the importance of primary care in providing integrated services; (iii) improving the governance and (iv) fostering better data collection and information channels to support the decision making process. Results In the parliamentary debate, was discussed the concept that, in the near future, health systems' effectiveness and sustainability will very much depend on effective access to integrated services where primary care is pivotal, a clearer shift from care-oriented systems to health promotion and prevention, a profound commitment to good governance, particularly to stakeholders participation, and a systematic reuse of data meant to build health data-driven learning systems. Conclusions Many health issues, such as future health systems in the EU, are potentially transformative and hence an intense political issue. It is policy-making leadership that will mostly determine how well EU health systems are prepared to face future challenges.";"[Quaglio, Gianluca; Dawood, Amr; Karapiperis, Theodoros] European Parliament, Sci Foresight Unit Sci & Technol Opt Assessment S, Directorate Gen Parliamentary Res Serv EPRS, Rue Wiertz 60, B-1047 Brussels, Belgium; [Quaglio, Gianluca; Mantoan, Domenico] Directorate Gen Hlth & Social Serv, Venice, Italy; [Figueras, Josep] European Observ Hlth Syst & Policies, Brussels, Belgium; [Costongs, Caroline] EuroHealthNet, Brussels, Belgium; [Bernal-Delgado, Enrique] Inst Hlth Sci Aragon IACS, Zaragoza, Spain; [Bernal-Delgado, Enrique] European Collaborat Hlth Care Optimizat ECHO Proj, Zaragoza, Spain; [Bernal-Delgado, Enrique] BRIDGEHlth Project, Brussels, Belgium";"Quaglio, G (corresponding author), European Parliament, Sci Foresight Unit Sci & Technol Opt Assessment S, Directorate Gen Parliamentary Res Serv EPRS, Rue Wiertz 60, B-1047 Brussels, Belgium.; Quaglio, G (corresponding author), Directorate Gen Hlth & Social Serv, Venice, Italy.";gianluca.quaglio@europarl.europa.eu;;BERNAL-DELGADO, ENRIQUE/0000-0002-0961-3298;;;;54;0;0;1;10;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;1741-3842;1741-3850;;J PUBLIC HEALTH-UK;J.

Raw material sources are shown to be the ideal places for research and analysis of the transmission of technical knowledge. This study is based on the analysis of abandoned cores at the site. The methodology and criteria that were utilized to identify lithic debris resulting from apprentice workmanship are described. Identification of errors in selection and execution has enabled a classification of cores according to distinctions in flint knapping ability: expert, advanced, and novice. A premature abandonment of a core is associated with novice workmanship. The method of knowledge transfer of lithic technology is also discussed, proposing an instructional system that may have been used in this early agricultural society.

This expert system is based on hydrological and meteorological data for 1991-2016. The data were processed using a machine learning technique and adjacent mathematics, because there is no mathematical model of the ice-jamming process and time series of observations are too short to apply classical statistics. This expert system was developed in 2012; it was adjusted using data from 1991-2010 seasons obtained at hydrological stations. The current investigation involves additional data on 2011-2016 seasons to repeat learning and estimate system quality. The developed system demonstrates a reliable efficiency: the forecast results coincide with observations for all six added seasons (2011-2016). It should be noted that the additional data do not change forecast accuracy, which remained approximately 85%, like in the previous study.

Our previous findings suggest the regional differences in academic level in tertiary (grade III level A) children's hospitals in China. Methods: This systemic evaluation described in this protocol will be conducted to follow the Cochrane Handbook. We will perform a systemic literature search of relevant databases including Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP Paper Check System) and English databases (Medline, EMbase, Cochrane Library) from inception to December 31, 2018. The search strategy will be enacted according to the guidance offered from the Cochrane Handbook. Two rounds of searches will be conducted to prevent the omission of relevant literature. A pre-set grading standard will be used to give calculation weight (W) to evaluate the quality of each article. Data synthesis will be performed using STATA software (version 13.1, Statacorp, College Station, Texas). Pediatric pharmacy development index (PPDI) of each hospital will be used to evaluate the pediatric pharmacy development in each tertiary children's hospitals. The cumulative calculation weight (Sigma W) and annual calculation weight (Sigma W-year) will be used to evaluate the academic level of pharmaceutical departments in different tertiary children's hospitals. Subgroup analysis will be performed to compare the number of different types of articles published between different hospitals base on different research areas such as policy research, basic research, and clinical research. Results: In this article, we will evaluate pediatric pharmacy development and the research area of pediatric pharmacy experts in China. Based on the results from this research, we will analyze the professional backgrounds of pediatric pharmacy experts from 23 tertiary children's hospitals in China. According to the contents and research directions of literature published by the pediatric pharmacy experts in these 23 hospitals, we will determine the professional field of pediatric pharmacy experts and establish an expert database. In the process of formulating the related national or local policies in the future, the expert database will be selected accurately to reach the expert consensus. Conclusion: Our study will provide a comprehensive picture of pediatric pharmacy development in China.

GoalPurpose and Method: The main idea of this research is about the structure of religious world and its impact on the dominant idea of the era and their factors, actions, and the hierarchy of power. To understand this hierarchy and the development of spiritual apparatus, firstly, we consider the world of religious thought and its impact on the formation of hierarchy and the behavior of subjects investigate and in the next step, we consider the agents-institutions and their ratio with the dominant idea in the contemporary art world. Conclusion: In this study, religion and art are considered as two homologous texts. Considering the role of institutions and its's agents in the creation of the religious world, it seems that this route can be traced more correctly their,. It could be seen that here the Church and its spiritual apparatus have a great deal of association with the organizations and institutions of the world of art and its hierarchical construction.

In order to firmly establish this new system for highly difficult new medical technologies, it is very important and informative to survey the current situation for guidelines and consensus regarding introduction of medical technology with special skills in Japan and overseas. Based on the survey of questionnaires, document retrieval, and expert interviews, we found that documentation related to the introduction process of highly difficult medical technologies is very rare, and the regulations were mainly issued by academic societies. Moreover, even if such documentation existed, the quality of the regulations is poor and not sufficient enough to perform surgical practice safely. Therefore. for medical practitioners, comprehensive and concrete regulations should be issued by the government or ministry to legally follow in regard to technically demanding operations. A new practice guideline was proposed by our special research group to regulate the introduction process of highly difficult new medical technologies in hospitals in Japan. This guideline, gained understanding from relevant academic societies, provided a comprehensive view on the interpretation of high difficulty new medical technology prescribed by the law and show the basic idea at a preliminary examination from the viewpoints of Surgeon's requirement, Guidance system, Medical safety and Informed consent.

In 1987, the exploration of these techniques gave rise to the experton concept as an integrating element that allows the collection of all information expressed by a group of experts relating to the level or degree of truth of a statement or the degree of fulfilment of a certain vague or imprecise characteristic. Over the thirty years since its formulation, the experton concept has been applied as a support element in decision-making processes in many areas of the social sciences. The aim of this article is to present a generalization of the experton concept for both the discrete and continuous cases, which respects known properties and has the potential to be practically applied in various situations where there is a need to perform a simulation of various opinion scenarios relating to a characteristic or statement, and thus explore new approaches to decision-making models.;"[Caries Ferrer-Comalat, Joan; Linares-Mustaros, Salvador; Corominas-Coll, Dolors] Univ Girona, Dept Business Adm, Girona, Spain";Ferrer-Comalat, JC (corresponding author), Univ Girona, Dept Business Adm, Girona, Spain.;"joancarles.ferrer@udg.edu; tralvadonlinares@udg.edu; dolors.corominas@udg.edu";Comalat, Joan Carles Ferrer/Q-1143-2016;"Comalat, Joan Carles Ferrer/0000-0001-9001-9925; Linares-Mustaros, Salvador/0000-0001-6274-9410";University of Girona (UdG) [MPCUdG2016/107];The authors acknowledge the University of Girona (UdG) Government through the Program to improve the scientific productivity of the UdG research groups through the project Development of instruments for the analysis of business management (project number: MPCUdG2016/107).;;34;3;3;0;1;WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD;SINGAPORE;5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE;0218-4885;1793-6411;;INT J UNCERTAIN FUZZ;Int.

Therefore, this paper attempts to formulate a qualitative institutional-social-ecological model, by showcasing how the 10 steps modelling is relevant and is applied to the institutional-property-rights model of neighbourhood residential commons. Using an instance from one case study (i.e., Sabah, Malaysia), a conceptual problem-solution model describing local property-rights system tragedies of public open space (POS) governance and quality, and the emergence of self-governing collective action was demonstrated. Methodologically, the modelling procedures were specified as a 10-step process, starting with setting the objectives of the model and concluding with the validation of suitability and usefulness of the model. The validation was conducted using the experts' opinion, via the semi-structured interviews with five public officials. With slight necessary amendments, the model was proven practical, useful, flexible, reliable and valid in serving its purposes in understanding and predicting the effects of local property-rights system tragedies on POS commons dilemmas, and the subsequent emergence and necessity of a self-governing solution. This local model provides policy insights to the local public officials, which facilitate their institutional-social-ecological decision-making process that helps improve local POS governance and quality.;"[Ling, Gabriel Hoh Teck] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm & Surveying Urban & Reg Planni, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Leng, Pau Chung] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm & Surveying Architecture, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia";Ling, GHT (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Built Environm & Surveying Urban & Reg Planni, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia.;"gabriel.ling@utm.my; pcleng2@utm.my";Leng, Pau Chung/AAE-5132-2019;Ling, Gabriel, H.

Brand personality as a part of brand identity plays an important role in communications; if a brand has no personality, it cannot introduce itself and stay in the mind of the customer. Customer understanding about a brand is far more important than what is expressed as brand reality. Thus, developing an appropriate personality for creating a compatible image of the brand in the customer's mind will be an important factor. Therefore, organizations must develop appropriate primitive principles to establish a long relationship with customers. Objective. This study was conducted to identify and introduce intervening and fundamental factors affecting the formation of brand personality of the Iran Football league. Methods. Here, a qualitative research was conducted using a grounded research method. Data collection tools involved deep interviews with experts (23 individuals) selected by purposive and snowball sampling. Data analysis was performed using open encodings, axial, and selective methods. Results. Based on the qualitative interviews, 33 signs were obtained for conditions influencing the formation of league brand personality (contextual factors and intervening conditions). Having analyzed these factors and summarized the findings based on the connection index and similarity with each other, and with the constant comparison, these signs were eventually reduced to five concepts or categories including product factors, factors unrelated to the product as well as the external and macro environment. Conclusion. If brand personality is defined based on market research or people's tastes, adapting the whole system with the brand personality and present promises is a tedious task. On the other hand, the research method contributes to obtaining the same pattern for each product category or service. So in order to build a brand personality from the organization perspective, managers and planners should identify intervening conditions and contextual factors which can disrupt the strategies adopted (intervening factors). Alternatively, with appropriate contextualization, they can contribute to the development of these strategies and act toward these factors for the formation of the brand personality of the league.";"[Tabatabaeian, Fakhrossadat; Rasooli, Mehdi] Sport Sci Res Inst Iran, Sport Management Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Khabiri, Mohammad] Univ Tehran, Fac Sport Sci, Sport Management Dept, Tehran, Iran";Tabatabaeian, F (corresponding author), Sport Sci Res Inst Iran, Sport Management Dept, Tehran, Iran.;tabatabaeian2009@yahoo.ca;;;;;;32;0;0;1;2;ANNALS APPLIED SPORT SCIENCE;TEHRAN;C/O SEYED MORTEZA TAYEBI, ALLAMEH TABATABA I UNIV-ATU, PO BOX 1489684511, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN;2322-4479;;;ANN APPL SPORT SCI;Ann.

Promoting the use of these systems substantially improves the quality of life in cities by reducing pollutant emissions and traffic congestion. In these systems, bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis. They allow people to borrow a bike in one dock and return it to any other station with free docks belonging to the same system. The occupancy level of the stations can be constantly monitored. However, to achieve a satisfactory user experience, all the stations in the system must be neither overloaded nor empty when the user needs to access the station. The aim of this paper is to analyze occupancy level data acquired from real systems to determine situations of dock overload in multiple stations which could lead to service disruption. The proposed methodology relies on a pattern mining approach. A new pattern type called Occupancy Monitoring Pattern is proposed here to detect situations of dock overload in multiple stations. Since stations are geo-referenced and their occupancy levels are periodically monitored, occupancy patterns can be filtered and evaluated by taking into consideration both the spatial and temporal correlation of the acquired measurements. The results achieved on real data highlight the potential of the proposed methodology in supporting domain experts in their maintenance activities, such as periodic re-balancing of the occupancy levels of the stations, as well as in improving user experience by suggesting alternative stations in the nearby area.;"[Cagliero, Luca; Cerquitelli, Tania; Garza, Paolo; Ricupero, Giuseppe; Baralis, Elena] Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Automat & Informat, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Chiusano, Silvia] Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Interateneo Sci Progetto & Polit Ter, Viale Pier Andrea Mattioli 39, I-10125 Turin, Italy";Cagliero, L (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Automat & Informat, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.;"luca.cagliero@polito.it; tania.cerquitelli@polito.it; silvia.chiusano@polito.it; paolo.garza@polito.it; giuseppe.ricupero@polito.it; elena.baralis@polito.it";;"Ricupero, Giuseppe/0000-0002-3497-4925; Garza, Paolo/0000-0002-1263-7522; Cerquitelli, Tania/0000-0002-9039-6226";Italian Ministry of Research (MIUR)Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) [SCN_00325];The research leading to these results was partially funded by the Italian Ministry of Research (MIUR) under the smart cities and Communities Grant Agreement n.

The clustering of scholarly articles based on research issues can facilitate analyses of related articles on specific issues in scientific literature. It is a task of overlapping clustering, as an article may discuss multiple issues, and hence, be clustered into multiple clusters. Clustering is challenging, as it is difficult to identify the research issues with which to cluster the articles. In this paper, we propose the use of the titles of the references cited by the articles to tackle the challenge, based on the hypothesis that such information may indicate the research issues discussed in the article. A technique referred to as ICRT (Issue-based Clustering with Reference Titles) was thus developed. ICRT works as a post-processor for various clustering systems. In experiments on those articles that domain experts have selected to annotate research issues about specific entity associations, ICRT works with various clustering systems that employ state-of-the-art similarity measures for scholarly articles. ICRT successfully improves these systems by identifying clusters of articles with the same research focuses on specific entity associations. The contribution is of technical and practical significance to the exploration of research issues reported in scientific literature (supporting the curation of entity associations found in the literature).;"[Liu, Rey-Long; Hsu, Chih-Kai] Tzu Chi Univ, Dept Med Informat, Hualien 97004, Taiwan";Liu, RL (corresponding author), Tzu Chi Univ, Dept Med Informat, Hualien 97004, Taiwan.;"rlliutcu@mail.tcu.edu.tw; 107325106@gms.tcu.edu.tw";;;Tzu Chi University, Taiwan;The APC was funded by Tzu Chi University, Taiwan.;;31;1;1;0;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2076-3417;;;APPL SCI-BASEL;Appl.

For high water-containing biomass, hydrothermal processes (HTP) are particularly promising as they require wet conditions for optimal processing anyway. In Germany, however, HTP have not yet reached the industrial level, although suitable substrates are available and technological progress has been made in previous years. This study aims to determine why this is by identifying key factors that need to occur HTP development in Germany until 2030. By using results of previous analyses within this context (i.e., literature review, SWOT analysis, expert survey, and focus group workshop) and combining them with the results of an expert workshop and Delphi-survey executed during this analysis, a comprehensive information basis on important development factors is created. Fuzzy logic is used to analyze these factors in terms of interconnections, relevance, and probability of occurrence by 2030. The results show that technological factors, such as a cost-efficient process water treatment and increased system integration of HTP into bio-waste and wastewater treatment plants, are given high relevance and probability of occurrence. The adaptation of the legal framework, for example, the approval of end products from HTP as standard fuels, has very high relevance but such adaptions are considered relatively unlikely.;"[Reissmann, Daniel; Thraen, Daniela; Bezama, Alberto] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Thraen, Daniela] Deutsch Biomasseforschungszentrum Gemeinnutzige G, Torgauer Str 116, D-04347 Leipzig, Germany";Reissmann, D (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.;"daniel.reissmann@ufz.de; daniela.thraen@ufz.de; alberto.bezama@ufz.de";"Thran, Daniela/E-7672-2015; Reissmann, Daniel R/E-8268-2010";"Thran, Daniela/0000-0002-6573-6401; ";Helmholtz Association under the Joint Initiative Energy System 2050-A Contribution of the Research Field Energy;This work was supported by the Helmholtz Association under the Joint Initiative Energy System 2050-A Contribution of the Research Field Energy.;;63;7;7;0;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;1996-1073;;;ENERGIES;Energies;DEC;2018;11;12;;;;;;;3532;10.3390/en11123532;;;20;Energy & Fuels;Energy & Fuels;HG9VB;WOS:000455358300293;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-02-18;

As the first step of mobile transactions, bankcard enrollment on mobile devices has become the primary target of fraud attempts. Although no immediate financial loss is incurred after a fraud attempt, subsequent fraudulent transactions can be quickly executed and could easily deceive the fraud detection systems if the fraud attempt succeeds at the bankcard enrollment step. In recent years, financial institutions and service providers have implemented rule-based expert systems and adopted short message service (SMS) user authentication to address this problem. However, the above solution is inadequate to face the challenges of data loss and social engineering. In this study, we introduce several traditional machine learning algorithms and finally choose the improved gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm software library for use in a real system, namely, XGBoost. We further expand multiple features based on analysis of the enrollment behavior and plan to add historical transactions in future studies. Subsequently, we use a real card enrollment dataset covering the year 2017, provided by a worldwide payment processor. The results and framework are adopted and absorbed into a new design for a mobile payment fraud detection system within the Chinese payment processor.;"[Zhou, Hao; Chai, Hong-feng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Cyber Secur, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Hao; Qiu, Mao-lin] China UnionPay, Dept Risk Control, Shanghai 200135, Peoples R China; [Chai, Hong-feng] China UnionPay, Shanghai 200135, Peoples R China; [Chai, Hong-feng] Chinese Acad Engn, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China";"Zhou, H (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Cyber Secur, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.; Zhou, H (corresponding author), China UnionPay, Dept Risk Control, Shanghai 200135, Peoples R China.";zhouhaounionpay@sjtu.edu.cn;;zhou, hao/0000-0002-0869-6570;China UnionPay;Project supported by China UnionPay;;23;4;4;0;13;ZHEJIANG UNIV;HANGZHOU;EDITORIAL BOARD, 20 YUGU RD, HANGZHOU, 310027, PEOPLES R CHINA;2095-9184;2095-9230;;FRONT INFORM TECH EL;Front.

The planning of such axes can steer population and traffic flows, decisions on the locations of economic developments as well as infrastructures such as cable networks. In this paper, current spatial planning axes and their continuity are analysed regarding their suitability to promote sustainable cross-border European development. Two neighbouring regions are investigated as examples, namely the Regional Planning Authority Oberes Elbtal/Osterzgebirge (Germany, Saxony) and the Usti nad Labem Region (Czechia). The overarching research question is how transboundary spatial planning axes can be harmonised? This can be broken down into the following three sub-questions: (1) Which differences exist between the Saxon and Czech planning systems? (2) How is the need for harmonisation assessed by planning practitioners? (3) Which transboundary recommendations can be given from a scientific perspective? To answer these research questions, expert interviews were conducted with relevant stakeholders from spatial planning authorities as well as scientific and political institutions. Highlights for public administration, management and planning: Different perceptions concerning the effects of the application of spatial planning axes were identified; i.e. spatial planning axes in Czechia primarily directed at economic activities, whereas established for improved connections and to boost development in Germany. Incompatibilities between German and Czech spatial planning cultures may hinder any endeavour for cross-border governance of spatial planning axes. Requirements and potentials for the harmonisation of spatial planning axes on both sides of the border are proposed. For the current spatial planning axes in Czechia, a stronger line-oriented designation of existing and newly designated axes is desirable and legally feasible. In the Saxon spatial planning documents, the rescaling of existing cross-border planning axes to Czechia would support the functions lost due to recent infrastructural developments at other locations.";"[Bartel, Sebastian; Albrecht, Juliane] Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev, Weberpl 1, D-01217 Dresden, Germany; [Hruska, Vladan; Rybova, Kristyna] Univ JE Purkyne, Dept Geog, Ceske Mladeze 8, Usti Nad Labem 40096, Czech Republic; [Ortner, Andreas] Tech Univ Dresden, Chair Land Management, Dezernat 8, D-01062 Dresden, Germany";Bartel, S (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev, Weberpl 1, D-01217 Dresden, Germany.;s.bartel@ioer.de;;;Small Project Fund of the Euroregion Elbe/Labe;We thank the Small Project Fund of the Euroregion Elbe/Labe for the financial support (Project Untersuchung der Passfahigkeit der grenzuberschreitenden Achsen in der Euroregion Elbe/Labe - Vyzkum navaznosti preshranicnich rozvojovych os v Euroregionu Elbe/Labe).

J;Simshaw, D;;;;Simshaw, Drew;;;Ethical Issues in Robo-Lawyering: The Need for Guidance on Developing and Using Artificial Intelligence in the Practice of Law;HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;As in many other industries, artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to drastically transform the legal services landscape. Bots, automated expert systems, and predictive analytics are already changing the way consumers seek, and lawyers provide, legal services. Among other impacts, AI has the potential to increase access to justice in the self-help, individual, and corporate law firm markets by lowering costs and expanding services to untapped markets. A prominent question in early literature on AI in law is whether these services constitute the unauthorized practice of law. Threshold questions of whether and by whom such services should be regulated are important, but will likely not be answered (or even answerable) until AI's impact on the profession is more cognizable. In the meantime, there is currently no comprehensive guidance for attorneys on how AI should be developed, adopted, and used in ways that conform to a lawyer's ethical obligations. Without such guidance, law firms and third-party services risk designing and adopting AI-driven tools that fail to provide effective client-centered services, inhibit wide-spread access to justice, and undermine lawyers' ethical obligations to current and former clients, including the obligations to practice competently, maintain confidentiality, effectively supervise third parties, communicate with clients, and exercise independent judgment and render candid advice. This Article initiates this critical dialogue by exploring the types of AI being implemented in the profession, and identifying characteristics of these emerging services that will present ethical tensions and challenges. It rigorously examines existing guidance from the ABA and state bar authorities concerning new technology in practice, and identifies areas where this guidance is not sufficient to confront the unique ethical issues presented by AI. This article does not attempt to provide detailed or prescriptive guidance on these issues, but rather identifies the imminent challenges not currently being addressed in the literature on AI and legal ethics, or by bar authorities.

CGM systems provide retrospective data, as well as the current glucose value and trend arrow data, which indicate the direction and velocity of changing glucose. In 2017, Aleppo and colleagues developed a simplified approach for adults with diabetes to safely adjust rapid-acting insulin doses using trend arrow information in the Dexcom G5 CGM system. Since then, the FreeStyle Libre and FreeStyle Libre 14-day CGM systems have become available in the United States; however, guidance on using trend arrow data that take the unique features of these systems into consideration is lacking. Specifically, the FreeStyle Libre systems do not have automatic alarms, which impact how the system and trend arrow data are used. The Endocrine Society convened an expert panel to address this gap and develop an approach to adjusting rapid-acting insulin doses for adults using trend arrows in the FreeStyle Libre systems. We based our approach on previous work and expanded upon engagement and scanning recommendations, and we incorporated pre-exercise planning specific to these systems. Our approach provides insulin dose adjustments as discrete insulin units based on an individual's insulin sensitivity and directionality of the trend arrow. We focus on the needs of patients treated with multiple daily injections because these individuals currently make up a greater proportion of individuals on intensive insulin therapy. Our recommendations are intended to provide a safe, practical approach to using trend arrows in the FreeStyle Libre systems.

Such evaluations are frequently described as non-trivial, subjective and highly time-consuming (depending on the evaluation level). Most of the time, perceptual assessment is performed individually by clinicians which can be problematic since judgment may vary from one clinician to the other. Clinicians have therefore expressed the need for new objective evaluation tools better adapted to longitudinal studies, the observation of small units and rehabilitation context to monitor patients' progress. We have previously proposed an automatic approach to the anomaly detection at the phone level for dysarthric speech. The system behavior was studied and validated with different corpora and speech styles and shows good results in this specific task. Nonetheless, the lack of annotated French dysarthric speech corpora has limited our ability to analyze some aspects of its behavior, such as severity, more precisely (more anomalies are detected automatically compared with human experts). To overcome this limitation, we proposed an original perceptual evaluation protocol applied to a limited set of decisions made by the automatic system, relating to the presence of anomalies. Particularly, we intended to focus our analyses on some ambiguous cases in order to enrich our knowledge about the system behavior. This evaluation was carried out by a jury of 29 non-naive individuals. Results confirm the relevance of the system for the anomaly detection, and place it within the most severe juries. Besides interesting information related to the system behavior, the evaluation protocol highlighted main differences between human process and the automatic system: humans have difficulties in focusing on small units and they are influenced by contextual information, while the system only focuses on small units. In a way, both approaches are probably complementary.;"[Laaridh, Imed; Fredouille, Corinne] Univ Avignon, LIA, 339 Chemin Meinajaries,Agroparc BP 91228, F-84911 Avignon 9, France; [Laaridh, Imed; Meunier, Christine] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LPL, Aix En Provence, France";Laaridh, I (corresponding author), Univ Avignon, LIA, 339 Chemin Meinajaries,Agroparc BP 91228, F-84911 Avignon 9, France.;"imed.laaridh@alumni.univ-avignon.fr; christine.meunier@univ-amu.fr; corinne.fredouille@univ-avignon.fr";;;"BLRI Labex [ANR-11-LABEX-0036]; A*MIDEX project - French government Investissements d'Avenir programFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02]; French ANR projet Typaloc [ANR-12-BSH2-0003-03]";This work was carried out thanks to the support of the BLRI Labex (ANR-11-LABEX-0036) and the A*MIDEX project (ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02) funded by the French government Investissements d'Avenir program managed by the ANR, and thanks to the French ANR projet Typaloc (ANR-12-BSH2-0003-03).

Due to the scarcity of urban land and the complexity of renovating old cities, and considering that brownfield research in Pakistan is still in its infancy, defining and evaluating brownfield is necessary for solving environmental issues and promoting sustainable development. Therefore, this study aims to develop a pioneer consensus-based brownfield definition, guidelines, and an evaluation index system to evaluate brownfield redevelopment in Pakistan. Initially, a comprehensive literature review was performed to gather key elements of brownfield definitions and create an evaluation index system. These indicators were further evaluated by different experts through the Delphi Method to develop a final questionnaire. Then, data were collected from relevant stakeholders. An illustrative example using three ideal schemes (housing society, eco-industrial park, and commercial market) is described to apply the evaluation index system. A new methodology combining Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFNs) and Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) was introduced to assess three ideal schemes. Finally, a pioneer brownfield definition, guidelines, and evaluation index system for brownfield redevelopment were developed, and a further index system was verified through an illustrative example. The standard brownfield definition, guidelines, and established index system is based on the Pakistani context. Due to changes in rules and regulation, and different land characteristics, these findings cannot be generalized to all developing countries. Therefore, further studies must validate the results in their own context. This study will foster brownfield redevelopment implementation in Pakistan and promote sustainable development.;"[Ahmad, Naveed; Zhu, Yuming; Waheed, Abdul] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, 127 West Friendship Rd, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ibrahim, Muhammad] Inst Business Management, Dept Engn Sci, Karachi 74900, Sindh, Pakistan; [Waqas, Muhammad] Changan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Second Ring Rd, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China";"Ahmad, N; Zhu, YM (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, 127 West Friendship Rd, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.";"naveedahmad@mail.nwpu.edu.cn; zym1886@nwpu.edu.cn; muhammad.ibrahim@iobm.edu.pk; waqasalyani23@chd.edu.cn; waheed_2506@mail.nwpu.edu.cn";Ahmad, Naveed/L-2333-2019;"Ahmad, Naveed/0000-0002-3621-6765; Waqas, Muhammad/0000-0001-6151-8864";Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province [2017JM7002];This research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, grant number 2017JM7002.;;65;0;0;8;33;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2071-1050;;SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL;Sustainability;DEC;2018;10;12;;;;;;;4347;10.3390/su10124347;;;22;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology";HG9OL;WOS:000455338100013;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-02-18;

Among the different photovoltaic systems, there are several classification criteria, depending on the technology, application, and size of the modules that define them. The size (installed nominal capacity) stands out as an impartial and critical measure in the decision-making process. In this article, we use a multi-criteria decision-making method to analyze the responses of five experts to a detailed questionnaire in which several different criteria are correlated with various photovoltaic installation sizes. The limitation associated with a low number of experts is addressed with a robustness and sensitivity analysis. With this study, we seek first to apply and demonstrate the feasibility of a methodology that combines technical information with multi-criteria decision-making methods. Second, we obtain a clear result that increases the benefits of a forthcoming photovoltaic installation of modules in distributed generation, adding up to one GW total peak power in standard conditions. We observe a consistent result in which smaller photovoltaic modules provide the ideal solution, as this format maximizes the socio-economic benefits of any installation. If a decision has to be taken about the type of photovoltaic plant to be installed, the conclusion is clear: given a certain size, small, easily scalable installations are the best solution for stakeholders, the inhabitants, and the environment.;"[Guerrero-Liquet, Guido C.; Socorro Garcia-Cascales, M.; Urbina, Antonio] Tech Univ Cartagena, Dept Elect Comp Technol & Projects, Cartagena 30202, Spain; [Oviedo-Casado, Santiago; Prior, Javier] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Fis Aplicada, Cartagena 30202, Spain; [Sanchez-Lozano, J.

Over 90% of malaria deaths world-wide occurred in the WHO African Region. New tools are needed to regain momentum and further decrease the burden of malaria. Gene drive, an emerging technology that can enhance the inheritance of beneficial genes, offers potentially transformative solutions for overcoming these challenges. Gene drives may decrease disease transmission by interfering with the growth of the malaria parasite in the mosquito vector or reducing mosquito reproductive capacity. Like other emerging technologies, development of gene drive products faces technical and non-technical challenges and uncertainties. In 2018, to begin addressing such challenges, a multidisciplinary group of international experts published comprehensive recommendations for responsible testing and implementation of gene drive-modified mosquitoes to combat malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa. Considering requirements for containment, efficacy and safety testing, monitoring, stakeholder engagement and authorization, as well as policy and regulatory issues, the group concluded that gene drive products for malaria can be tested safely and ethically, but that this will require substantial coordination, planning, and capacity development.

Through a thorough literature review, the authors identified 57 risks associated with international steel construction, operation, and transference of new technologies. Pairwise comparisons of all 57 risks by 14 subject-matter experts resulted in a relative weighting. Furthermore, to mitigate human subjectivity, vagueness, and uncertainty, a fuzzy analysis based on the findings of two case studies was performed. From these combined analyses, weighted individual risk soring resulted in the following top five most impactful international steel project risks: procurement of raw materials; design errors and omissions; conditions of raw materials; technology spill prevention plan; investment cost and poor plant availability and performance. Risk mitigation measures are also presented, and risk scores are re-assessed through the AHP-FIS analysis model depicting an overall project risk score reduction. The model presented is a useful tool for industry performing steel project risk assessments. It also provides decision-makers with a better understanding of the criticality of risks that are likely to occur on international steel projects.";"[Kim, Min-Sung] POSCO Pohang Iron & Steel Co, POIST Task Force Team, 6261 Donghaean Ro, Pohang 37666, South Korea; [Lee, Eul-Bum; Jung, In-Hye] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Grad Inst Ferrous Technol, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, South Korea; [Lee, Eul-Bum; Jung, In-Hye] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Grad Sch Engn Mastership, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, South Korea; [Alleman, Douglas] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Construct Engn & Management, Boulder, CO 80309 USA";"Lee, EB (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Grad Inst Ferrous Technol, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, South Korea.; Lee, EB (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Grad Sch Engn Mastership, 77 Cheongam Ro, Pohang 37673, South Korea.";"minsungkim@postech.ac.kr; dreblee@postech.ac.kr; juinhy@postech.ac.kr; doal7544exc@colorado.edu";;"Alleman, Douglas/0000-0002-0921-2769; LEE, EUL-BUM/0000-0001-8885-1798";Ministry of Trade Industry and Energy Korea through the Technology Innovation Program funding (Developing Intelligent Project Management Information Systems for Engineering Projects) [10077606];"The authors acknowledge that this research was sponsored by the Ministry of Trade Industry and Energy Korea through the Technology Innovation Program funding (Developing Intelligent Project Management Information Systems for Engineering Projects; Grant number = 10077606).";;70;3;3;4;15;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2071-1050;;SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL;Sustainability;DEC;2018;10;12;;;;;;;4780;10.3390/su10124780;;;17;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology";HG9OL;WOS:000455338100446;;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-02-18;

A two-stage methodological framework was developed to assess the competitiveness of the three route alternatives, namely the Panama and Suez canals and the US intermodal system. In the first stage, a combination of literature review and expert knowledge was employed to identify the determinants of route selection. In the second stage, fuzzy theory and the multi-criteria decision-making technique were used to evaluate the criteria and the route alternatives. The results indicate that transportation cost is the most important factor in choosing a route, followed by transportation time, reliability, and route characteristics.

The large scale and importance of water projects, the investments needed, the difficulty in predicting the results, and the irreversible character of the decisions have made decision making a complex scientific process. This paper presents a multicriteria analysis (MCA) tool for evaluating water resource management (WRM) strategies and selecting the most appropriate among them, using as an example a Greek area based on agricultural economy, which faces water scarcity problems. Seven alternative strategies were evaluated under hydrological and economic criteria. Four techniques were usedmulti attribute utility theory (MAUT), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), elimination and choice expressing reality (ELECTRE), and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS)based on the main MCA techniques (utility theory, analytical hierarchy, outranking theory, and classification theory, respectively), to compare their performance, and to reach the most appropriate and fitting' method for the examined problem. The weightings extracted from two samples, (i) a sample of decision makers/stakeholders and (ii) a group of WRM experts, were used to compare the results. The process was carried out for each questionnaire, and thus the model shows the uncertainty of each sample group and of each method, as well as the overall uncertainty. The results illustrate the reality of the WRM problems of the watershed, enlighten their roots, and have further strengthened our conviction that the cooperation between the scientific community and the authorities is vital for more sustainable and efficient WRM.;"[Alamanos, Angelos; Mylopoulos, Nikitas; Loukas, Athanasios; Gaitanaros, Dimitrios] Univ Thessaly, Dept Civil Engn, Lab Hydrol & Aquat Syst Anal, Volos 38334, Volos, Greece; [Loukas, Athanasios] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Rural & Surveying Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece";Alamanos, A (corresponding author), Univ Thessaly, Dept Civil Engn, Lab Hydrol & Aquat Syst Anal, Volos 38334, Volos, Greece.;"alamanos@civ.uth.gr; nikitas@civ.uth.gr; aloukas@civ.uth.gr; gaitanarosd@gmail.com";;"LOUKAS, ATHANASIOS/0000-0001-7597-9805; Alamanos, Angelos/0000-0002-3875-2449";"programme of State Scholarships Foundation (IKY)-by the European Union (European Social Fund-ESF); Greek State Scholarships FoundationGreek Ministry of Development-GSRT";The preparation of the article has been co-financed-via a programme of State Scholarships Foundation (IKY)-by the European Union (European Social Fund-ESF).

The objective of this project is to create an ERAS protocol for neonatal abdominal surgery. The protocol will identify and attempt to bridge the gaps between current practices and best evidence. Our study is the first paediatric ERAS protocol endorsed by the International ERAS Society. Methods A research team consisting of international clinical and family stakeholders as well as methodological experts have iteratively defined the scope of the protocol in addition to individual topic areas. A modified Delphi method was used to reach consensus. The second phase will include a series of knowledge syntheses involving a rapid review coupled with expert opinion. Potential protocol elements supported by synthesised evidence will be identified. The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system will be used to determine strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The third phase will involve creation of the protocol using a modified RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Group consensus will be used to rate each element in relation to the quality of evidence supporting the recommendation and the appropriateness for guideline inclusion. This protocol will form the basis of a future implementation study. Ethics and dissemination This study has been registered with the ERAS Society.

To support and strengthen the health system, the eHealth architecture needs to be formulated and established prior to the implementation and development of any national eHealth applications and services. The aim of this study is to design and validate a standard questionnaire to assess the current status of national eHealth architecture (NEHA) components. Methods and analysis This study will use a mixed-methods design consisting of four phases: (1) item generation through review of evidences and experts' opinions, (2) face and content validity of the questionnaire, (3) determination of a range of possible scenarios for each item included in the questionnaire and (4) evaluation of reliability. This questionnaire is expected to generate critical and important information about the status of NEHA components that will be useful for monitoring, formulating, developing, implementing and evaluating NEHA. Our paper will contribute, we envisage, to establishment of a socio-technical basis on which governments and other relevant sectors can compare the policy interventions that boost the availability and utilisation of eHealth services within their settings. Ethics and dissemination The Ethics Committee for Research at the Tehran University of Medical Sciences approved the study protocol. We will obtain informed consent from each participant and collect data anonymously to maintain confidentiality. The translation of the findings into future policy planning will include the production of a series of peer-reviewed articles, presentation of the findings at relevant eHealth conferences and preparation of policy reports to the international organisations aiming to strengthen national capacity for better-informed eHealth architecture.;"[Mousavi, Seyyed Meysam; Takian, Amirhossein] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Management & Econ, Tehran, Iran; [Takian, Amirhossein] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Publ Policy, Tehran, Iran; [Takian, Amirhossein] Univ Tehran Med Sci, HERC, Tehran, Iran; [Tara, Mahmood] Mashhad Univ Med Sci, Dept Med Informat, Fac Med, Mashhad, Iran";"Takian, A (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Management & Econ, Tehran, Iran.; Takian, A (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Publ Policy, Tehran, Iran.; Takian, A (corresponding author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, HERC, Tehran, Iran.";takian@tums.ac.ir;Mousavi, Seyyed Meysam/P-7797-2015;"Mousavi, Seyyed Meysam/0000-0002-6795-7224; Tara, Mahmood/0000-0003-3945-7772";Tehran University of Medical SciencesTehran University of Medical Sciences [240-897];Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Grant No: 240-897).;;31;3;3;0;1;BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP;LONDON;BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND;2044-6055;;;BMJ OPEN;BMJ Open;DEC;2018;8;12;;;;;;;e022885;10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022885;;;6;Medicine, General & Internal;General & Internal Medicine;HG9EM;WOS:000455309300068;30580265;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-02-18;

The aim of this study was to (1) develop a taxonomy to identify practice and program elements of interventions targeting FMP and (2) examine the interrater reliability of this taxonomy. The development procedure of the taxonomy consisted of five steps, in which different data sources were used (e.g., existing taxonomies, national guidelines for FMP, intervention manuals and field experts) to ensure the comprehensiveness of the taxonomy. The taxonomy of interventions for families with multiple problems (TIFMP) was developed and tested on eight FMP interventions that had at least moderate effect sizes (> 0.5) in the Dutch context. It consisted of 53 practice elements in eight main categories (e.g., working on behavioral change and relieve tasks) and six program elements (e.g., duration and intensity). Raters had an average agreement for practice elements of 84.9%, ranging from 73.6% to 90.6% for the eight FMP interventions. A wide range of FMP interventions can be described reliably with the TIFMP that comprises practice and program elements of interventions. Using this taxonomy can provide more insight into the actual content of interventions and enables optimisation of care for FMP.;"[Visscher, L.; Evenboer, K. E.; Jansen, D. E. M. C.; Reijneveld, S.

This interest confronts two problems: (1) business experts usually lack the skills required to apply data mining techniques, and (2) the specialists who know how to use these techniques are a scarce and valuable asset. To help democratise data mining, we proposed, in a previous work, the development of domain-specific languages (DSLs) that hide the complexity of data mining techniques. The objective of these DSLs is to allow business experts to specify analysis processes by using high-level primitives and terminology from the application domain. These specifications would then be automatically transformed into a low-level, executable form. Although these DSLs might offer a promising solution to the aforementioned problems, their development from scratch requires a considerable effort and, consequently, they are costly. In order to make these languages affordable, we present FLANDM, an ecosystem devised for the rapid development of DSLs for data mining democratisation. FLANDM provides a base infrastructure that can be easily customised for the particularities of each domain, enabling controlled and systematic reuse of previously developed artefacts. By using FLANDM, new DSLs for data mining democratisation can be defined achieving a 50% of reduction in their development costs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

National initiatives, federal legislation, and teacher recognition programs have sought to identify K-12 STEM master teachers and harness their potential. These efforts warrant a conceptual framework to quantify attributes of K-12 STEM master teachers, to foster pathways for the development of current and future leaders. Using a sample of 10 individuals from two extant programs of K-12 STEM master teachers (Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship and Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching), data from their career trajectories (sourced from Curriculum Vitae) were sequenced to construct and confirm the STEM Master Teacher (STEMMaTe) conceptual framework. This framework may be used to guide programmatic development to increase national capacity for K-12 STEM master teachers. Recommendations are discussed for the creation of pathways to develop STEM master teachers and increase their participation in the broader education system.;[Hite, Rebecca] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA;Hite, R (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.;"rebecca.hite@ttu.edu; milbournej@gmail.com";;;;;;134;2;2;1;9;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2227-7102;;;EDUC SCI;Educ.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an incurable malady that threatens the lives of millions around the world. The huge amount of medical information in terms of complex interdependence between progression of health problems and various other factors makes the representation of data more challenging. This study investigated how formal semantic standards could be used for building an ontology knowledge repository to provide ubiquitous healthcare and medical recommendations for COPD patient to reduce preventable harm. The novel contribution of the suggested framework resides in the patient-centered monitoring approach, as we work to create dynamic adaptive protection services according to the current context of patient. This work executes a sequential modular approach consisting of patient, disease, location, devices, activities, environment and services to deliver personalized real-time medical care for COPD patients. The main benefits of this project are: (1) adhering to dynamic safe boundaries for the vital signs, which may vary depending on multiple factors; (2) assessing environmental risk factors; and (3) evaluating the patient's daily activities through scheduled events to avoid potentially dangerous situations.

An intelligent processing model embedded in muscle activity pants has been developed based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference System (ANFIS) in order to recognize the types of several standard human motions. The processing circuit would digitize motion data from the fabric stretch sensor developed in previous research. Data were continuously flowed into the memory of microcontroller chip and processed in order to get important factors like as input variables of the classification model. The parameters chosen for developing the ANFIS system are the average of amplitude (AMP), the standard deviation of amplitude (STD), and the average cycle (CYC). The final decision on the types of the motions would be stored or transmitted to nearby monitoring devices. In this study, laboratory scale experiments were conducted for four different types of human motions such as walking, jumping, running, and sprinting in order to examine the feasibility of the ANFIS model developed. The accuracy of ANFIS model was compared with results of fuzzy inference system (FIS) model and artificial neural network (ANN) model. As expected, the results indicated that the adaptive neurofuzzy expert system developed could be used as one of the smart simulators in order to recognize human motions with robust and high accuracy classification rate. Based on the test statistics, ANFIS model has been proved to be superior to ANN and FIS in terms of classification rate.;"[Vu, Chicuong; Kim, Jooyong] Soongsil Univ, Dept Organ Mat & Fiber Engn, Seoul 06978, South Korea";Kim, J (corresponding author), Soongsil Univ, Dept Organ Mat & Fiber Engn, Seoul 06978, South Korea.;jykim@ssu.ac.kr;;;Soongsil University;The research was supported by Soongsil University.;;42;6;6;5;15;KOREAN FIBER SOC;SEOUL;KOREA SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY CTR #501 635-4 YEOGSAM-DONG, KANGNAM-GU, SEOUL 135-703, SOUTH KOREA;1229-9197;1875-0052;;FIBER POLYM;Fiber.

A well-defined and sustainable EU health information system infrastructure is lacking. The potential of a European Research Infrastructure Consortium on Health Information for Research and Evidence-based Policy (HIREP-ERIC) to take up this role is investigated. Methods: Two working groups, a BRIDGE Health Steering Committee and the European Commission's Drafting Group of the Expert Group on Health Information, discussed the technical and scientific description of the HIREP-ERIC through a consensus-driven modified Delphi technique. Results: Consensus was reached on three aspects of the HIREP-ERIC. First, it was defined as an infrastructure that facilitates interaction of networks and experts in health information by providing central governance and a more permanent collaboration. Second, the infrastructure should be distributed, with a central hub coordinating the operation of distributed networks. Third, it should provide easy access to high quality and comparable data for purposes of research and policy making, and focus its activities around generating, managing, exchanging and translating health information. Conclusion: A momentum has been created where representatives from 16 European countries agreed on the HIREP-ERIC as a pragmatic bottom-up approach to strengthen the current EU health information landscape. A Member States' commitment is needed at senior political level to make this consensus operational. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

While Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) offers relevant principles to address this policy problem, there are no tools to assess whether an innovation qualifies as a Responsible Innovation in Health (RIH). Drawing on RRI and health policy research, we developed a RIH Tool that entails a three-step process: screening, assessment and rating. Methods: To critically evaluate and improve the constructs of the Tool, we conducted an international Delphi study with experts (n = 19) in RRI, biomedical engineering, bioethics and Health Technology Assessment who were asked to examine: (1) the inclusion and exclusion criteria that should be used to identify whether an innovation may potentially qualify as a RIH (screening); (2) the responsibility dimensions and attributes that should be measured in more detail (assessment); and (3) the scoring system that should be applied (rating). Results: A large number of insightful comments was shared by experts (221 comments in Round 1; 69 in Round 2) and, after the second round, consensus was achieved for 16 of the 20 survey questions pertaining to the importance, clarity and appropriateness of the constructs. Conclusion: Further development of this Tool will help to bridge an important knowledge and policy gap by enlightening the decisions made at an early stage by innovation stakeholders, such as investors, technology developers, research funding agencies and policymakers.

Expected problems can range from mildly disruptive to catastrophic events. When attempting to optimize a road network and alleviate problems, it is vital to select appropriate solutions. This paper defines prototype web-based expert knowledge system improvement that can be utilized to optimize the road network of developing countries. Deciding on appropriate controlling measures is a crucial task because expected problems range from mildly disruptive to catastrophic. Experts can provide solutions to these problems only by using their previous experience. The ultimate task in optimizing road network problems is to select appropriate solutions. Although experts can regulate and resolve these problems by means of their silent knowledge and experience, novice engineers cannot, but expertise transfer from experts to novices is challenging in the traffic road area. Therefore, this body of knowledge needs to be stored in a computer system. Identifying the causes of traffic problems and applying appropriate actions and solutions to these problems could help control or prevent them. Therefore, the web-based expert system for optimizing the road network of developing countries that was developed in this study, Expert System to Control Problems in Traffic (TRSys), is a method concept. Knowledge was provided in the form of rules and coded in software through PHP programming. Web pages supporting the user interface were produced using a framework made up of HTML, CSS and J-Query.

The intention of the present study is to establish a new complementary data-intelligence (DI) model called wavelet extreme learning machine (WAELM) for forecasting river flow in a semi-arid environment. The monthly river flow data for the period 1991-2010 is used to calibrate and validate the applied predictive model, developed using antecedent flow data as predictor. The prediction efficiency of the developed WA-ELM model is validated against stand-alone ELM model. The performance of the models is diagnosed using multiple statistical metrics and graphical analysis visualization. The results reveal that incorporation of data pre-processing wavelet approach with ELM model enhances the river flow predictability. In quantitative term, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) measurements are reduced by 65% and 67% using WA-ELM over ELM model, respectively. The Taylor diagram reveals much closer proximity and the Violin plot shows similar distribution of WA-ELM simulated river flow to the observed river flow compared to stand-alone ELM simulated river flow. The hybridization of wavelet decomposition method with ELM model improves the ability of ELM model to extract the required information for modeling the non-stationary and high stochastic river flow pattern. Overall, the study reveals that WA-ELM can be a reliable methodology for modeling river flow in semi-arid environment and for different regimes (i.e., low-, medium- and high-flow).;"[Yaseen, Zaher Mundher; Shahid, Shamsuddin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Awadh, Salih Muhammad] Univ Baghdad, Coll Sci, Dept Geol, Baghdad, Iraq; [Sharafati, Ahmad] Islamic Azad Univ, Civil Engn Dept, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran, Iran";Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia.;myzaher@utm.my;"Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018; Sharafati, Ahmad/Q-5416-2019; Awadh, Salih Muhammad/H-8245-2019; FKA, SHAMSUDDIN SHAHID/B-5185-2010";"Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; Sharafati, Ahmad/0000-0003-0448-2871; Awadh, Salih Muhammad/0000-0002-2143-3716; FKA, SHAMSUDDIN SHAHID/0000-0001-9621-6452";Professional Development Research University (PDRU) [Q.J130000.21A2.04E47];The authors greatly acknowledge the support by the Professional Development Research University (PDRU) Grant No. Q.J130000.21A2.04E47.

Such injuries are generally caused by unsafe school-related factors and a lack of education about first aid. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the role of children by introducing first aid education using the First Aid Guideline (FAG) application. The purpose of this study was to develop a first aid education application for Indonesian children based on the Android operating system. Methods: The application was developed in several stages. The initial stage was the selection of the content that would be included in the application. The second and third stages were the making and testing of the application, respectively. The researchers worked with information technology experts during the development of this application. The application feasibility test included experts in the fields of emergency and medical-surgical medicine as well as information technology. The experts assessed the application by completing a questionnaire on learning media. The results were then analysed by kappa tests to assess the experts' perceptions. Results: The application contains emergency call menus, and information on the treatment of choking, burns, wounds, and bleeding. The application provides pictures and video tutorials, making it easier for users to learn about first aid. Statistical analysis showed a sufficient match between Experts 1 and 3 (mean 3.85 +/- SD 0.369; kappa = 0.615; p = 0.035) and Experts 1 and 2 (mean 3.85 f SD 0.369; kappa = 0.615; p = 0.035).

However, about 30% of patients present with advanced stage or relapsing tumours, which require administration of chemotherapy. While cisplatin-adriamycin-cyclophosphamide combination is regularly prescribed, other drugs have been assessed in the literature. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness (response rate) of systemic treatments, whatever the therapeutic line, including chemotherapy, targeted therapies and immunotherapies, in thymoma and thymic carcinoma, using the principles of evidence-based medicine. A systematic review was designed using the PICO system, by an experienced librarian and clinicians' experts in thoracic oncology, through the Ovid Medline system. Only phase II-IV trials and retrospective studies including at least 14 patients treated with the same regimen were considered. Articles were independently selected by at least two investigators. Fifty-five eligible articles were retrieved. Sixty% were dealing with platinum-based regimens, mainly cisplatin, and showed overall similar activity (mostly response rate above 50%) independently of the line of treatment or histological type (thymoma versus thymic carcinoma). Non-platinum based regimens included octreotide-prednisone and capecitabine-gemcitabine. Promising data of immunotherapy with antiPDL1 antibody (pembrolizumab) requires confirmation. Based on available data, the most popular and active regimens are cisplatin-anthracycline (CAP or ADOC) or cisplatin-etoposide combinations that should be recommended when considering first-line chemotherapy in thymoma or thymic carcinoma.;"[Berghmans, Thierry; Meert, Anne-Pascale] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Intens Care & Ontol Emergencies & Thorac Onc, Inst Jules Bordet, Brussels, Belgium; [Durieux, Valerie] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Bibliotheque Sci Sante, Brussels, Belgium; [Holbrechts, Stephane] CHU Ambroise Pare Mons, Dept Oncol, Mons, Belgium; [Jungels, Christiane] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Oncol Med, Brussels, Belgium; [Jungels, Christiane] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Inst Jules Bordet, Brussels, Belgium; [Lafitte, Jean-Jacques] Univ Lille, Lille, France; [Moretti, Luigi; Roelandts, Martine] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Radiotherapy, Inst Jules Bordet, Brussels, Belgium; [Ocak, Sebahat] Catholic Univ Louvain, Div Pneumol, CHU UCL Namur, Godinne Site, Yvoir, Belgium; [Ocak, Sebahat] UCL, IREC, Pole Pneumol ORL & Dermatol PNEU, Brussels, Belgium; [Girard, Nicolas] Inst Curie, Inst Thorax Curie Montsouris, Paris, France; [Berghmans, Thierry] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Fac Med Factuelle, Brussels, Belgium";Berghmans, T (corresponding author), Inst Jules Bordet, Rue Heger Bordet 1, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.;thierry.berghmans@bordet.be;;Durieux, Valerie/0000-0002-8975-6562;EURACAN initiative;This study is supported by the EURACAN initiative.

However, data for Mexico are limited. Methodology/Principal findings Burden of dengue fever (DF) and DHF in Mexico was assessed using official databases for epidemiological information, disabilities weights from Shepard et al, the reported number of cases and deaths, and costs. Overall costs of dengue were summed from direct medical costs to the health system, cost of dengue to the patient (out-of-pocket expenses [medical and non-medical], indirect costs [loss of earnings, patient and/or caregiver]), and other government expenditures on prevention/surveillance. The first three components, calculated as costs per case by a micro-costing approach (PAATI; program, actions, activities, tasks, inputs), were scaled up to overall cost using epidemiology data from official databases. PAATI was used to calculate cost of vector control and prevention, education, and epidemiological surveillance, based on an expert consensus and normative construction of an ideal scenario. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for Mexico in 2016 were calculated to be 2283.46 (1.87 per 100,000 inhabitants). Overall economic impact of dengue in Mexico for 2012 was US$144 million, of which US$44 million corresponded to direct medical costs and US$5 million to the costs from the patient's perspective. The estimated cost of prevention/surveillance was calculated with information provided by federal government to be US$95 million. The overall economic impact of DF and DHF showed an increase in 2013 to US$161 million and a decrease to US$133, US$131 and US$130 million in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Conclusions/Significance The medical and economic impact of dengue were in agreement with other international studies, and highlight the need to include governmental expenditure for prevention/surveillance in overall cost analyses given the high economic impact of these, increasing the necessity to evaluate its effectiveness.";"[Zubieta-Zavala, Adriana; Lopez-Cervantes, Malaquias; Isarel Hernandez-Gaytan, Sendy; Duran-Arenas, Luis] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Med, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Salinas-Escudero, Guillermo] Minist Hlth, Ctr Econ Studies & Social Hlth, Childrens Hosp Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ramos Castaneda, Jose] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Arbovirus, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico; [Lopez Yescas, Juan Guillermo] Sanofi Pasteur Latin Amer, Med Affairs, Mexico City, DF, Mexico";Duran-Arenas, L (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Med, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.;lduranarenas@gmail.com;;Zubieta-Zavala, Adriana/0000-0001-5096-5204;Sanofi Pasteur;This study was funded by Sanofi Pasteur.

Design: Two online surveys: survey 1 asked respondents to recommend novel and innovative strategies to promote healthy beverage behaviour; survey 2 asked respondents to rank each of these strategies on five domains (overall importance, feasibility, effectiveness, reach, health equity). Open-ended questions were coded and analysed for thematic content. Setting: Using a snowball sampling approach, respondents were invited to complete the survey through an email invitation or an anonymous listserv link. Of the individuals who received a private email invitation, 24% completed survey 1 and 29 % completed survey 2. Subjects: Survey 1 (n 276) and survey 2 (n 182) included expert stakeholders who work on issues related to SSB and water consumption. Results: Six overarching strategies emerged to change beverage consumption behaviours (survey 1): education; campaigns and contests; marketing and advertising; price changes; physical access; and improving the capacity of settings to promote healthy beverages. Labelling and sugar reduction (e.g. reformulation) were recommended as strategies to reduce SSB consumption, while water testing and remediation emerged as a strategy to promote water intake. Stakeholders most frequently recommended (survey 1) and provided higher ratings (survey 2) to strategies that used policy, systems and/or environmental changes. Conclusions: The present study is the first to assess stakeholder opinions on strategies to promote healthy beverage consumption.

It proposes a concurrent version of BFM models, which are Bayesian Networks built from FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) and used by MDPs (Markov Decision Processes). The models can separately handle different applications during the mission; they consider the context of the mission including external constraints (luminosity, climate, etc.), the health of the UAV (Energy, Sensor) as well as the computing resource availability including CPU (Central Processing Unit) load, FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) use and timing performances. The proposed solution integrates the constraints into a mission specification by means of FMEA tables in order to facilitate their specifications by non-experts. Decision-making processes are elaborated following a just enough quality management by automatically providing adequate implementation of the embedded applications in order to achieve the mission goals, in the context given by the sensors and the on-board monitors. We illustrate the concurrent BFM approach with a case study of a typical tracking UAV mission.

Although these services are usually subsidised, companies rely on revenues generated by ticket sales. Therefore, fare evasion (i.e., people using a transport service without paying for it) and ticket forgery (the production of an illegal ticket facsimile) have considerable influence on the companies' economic sustainability. As existing research regarding the economic perspective is limited, this paper presents a Delphi study that investigates the phenomena with a survey of experts in public transport companies and transport associations in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The findings of the survey provide insights into the overall perception and discuss relevant aspects of both fare evasion and ticket forgery, thereby not only highlighting practical implications, but also helping policy makers shape adequate policies for public transport in societies.;"[Fuerst, Elmar Wilhelm M.] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Transport & Logist Management, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Herold, David M.] Griffith Univ, Dept Int Business & Asian Studies, Gold Coast Campus,Parkland Dr, Southport, Qld 4215, Australia";Herold, DM (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Dept Int Business & Asian Studies, Gold Coast Campus,Parkland Dr, Southport, Qld 4215, Australia.;"elmar.fuerst@wu.ac.at; d.herold@griffith.edu.au";Herold, David M./N-4218-2013;Herold, David M./0000-0002-4023-2282;;;;67;4;4;0;7;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2075-4698;;;SOCIETIES;Societies;DEC;2018;8;4;;;;;;;98;10.3390/soc8040098;;;16;Sociology;Sociology;HG8SZ;WOS:000455275400007;;DOAJ Gold, Green Accepted;;;2021-02-18;

Results. - Here we highlight the disparity in practices between treating centers, then address the main topics to finally elaborate specific recommendations. Although it appears relatively simple to add geometrical margins around the clinical target volume to obtain the planning target volume as performed in photon radiotherapy, this procedure is not appropriate for carbon-ion radiation therapy. Due to the variation of the radiation quality in depth, there is no generic relative biological effectiveness value for carbon-ions outside of an isolated point, for a given fractionation and specific experimental conditions. Absorbed dose and equieffective dose for specified conditions must always be reported. Conclusions. - This work contributed to the development of standard operating procedures for carbon-ion radiation therapy clinical trials. These procedures are now being applied, particularly in the first phase III international, multicenter trial (PHRC Etoile). (C) 2018 Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique (SFRO).

In the multichannel environment, television rating controls consist of selecting content, the ratings of which are completely restored after advertising. The hybrid approach to rule set refinement based on fuzzy relational calculus simplifies the process of expert recommendation systems construction. By analogy with the problem of the inverted pendulum control, the managerial actions aim to retain the balance between the fuzzy demand and supply. The increase or decrease trends of the demand and supply are described by primary fuzzy relations. The rule-based solutions of fuzzy relational equations connect significance measures of the primary fuzzy terms. Program set refinement by solving fuzzy relational equations allows avoiding procedures of content-based selective filtering. The solution set generation corresponds to the granulation of television time, where each solution represents the time slot and the granulated rating of the content. In automated media planning, generation of the weekly TV program in the form of the granular solution provides the decrease of time needed for the programming of the channel broadcast grid.;"[Azarov, Olexiy; Krupelnitsky, Leonid] Vinnytsia Natl Tech Univ, Comp Facil Dept, 95 Khmelnitske Sh, UA-21021 Vinnytsia, Ukraine; [Rakytyanska, Hanna] Vinnytsia Natl Tech Univ, Soft Ware Design Dept, 95 Khmelnitske Sh, UA-21021 Vinnytsia, Ukraine";Rakytyanska, H (corresponding author), Vinnytsia Natl Tech Univ, Soft Ware Design Dept, 95 Khmelnitske Sh, UA-21021 Vinnytsia, Ukraine.;"azarov2@vntu.edu.ua; krupost@gmail.com; h_rakit@ukr.net";"Azarov, Olexiy D./H-8580-2018; Rakytyanska, Hanna B./H-9269-2018";"Rakytyanska, Hanna B./0000-0001-5863-3730; Krupelnitskyi, Leonid/0000-0001-7370-9772";;;;31;0;0;0;1;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2306-5729;;;DATA;Data;DEC;2018;3;4;;;;;;;57;10.3390/data3040057;;;21;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Multidisciplinary Sciences";"Computer Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics";HG1FO;WOS:000454696600020;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-02-18;

It helps decision-makers to make the timely and right decision. Using BI solutions, the decision-makers can improve decisions quality and ultimately they can be more efficient in fulfilling its business objective, contributing to the organization's competitive advantage. BI solutions and tools are not sufficient enough to make competitive advantage alone. Highly qualified personnel need to engage to extract the full potential of BI solutions and to be the bridge that connects domain and expert analytical knowledge. In this aspect, if managing of organization ambidexterity improves, decision quality improves as well. Final BI products and insight will be useful only if decision-makers use them at every level of decision making. The organization should take motivational steps to assure that managers read, prepare and exchange BI products. Decision-making standard of HiPPOs (the Highest Paid Person in Organization makes the decision) should be a relic of the past, and new decision-making process should be data and intelligence driven. The paper consists of three parts. Part 1-gives the overview of theoretical consideration of the decision-making process and manager's roles. In Part 2-BI system, with all its elements, is portrayed as the indispensable tool for the quality decision-making process.

At the earliest training stages, novices frequently focus on getting faster at the task. This may, as shown here, compromise the evolution of their precision scores, sometimes irreparably, if it is not controlled for as early as possible. Artificial intelligence could help make sure that a trainee reaches her/his optimal individual speed-accuracy trade-off by monitoring individual performance criteria, detecting critical trends at any given moment in time, and alerting the trainee as early as necessary when to slow down and focus on precision, or when to focus on getting faster. It is suggested that, for effective benchmarking, individual training statistics of novices are compared with the statistics of an expert surgeon. The speed-accuracy functions of novices trained in a large number of experimental sessions reveal differences in individual speed-precision strategies, and clarify why such strategies should be automatically detected and controlled for before further training on specific surgical task models, or clinical models, may be envisaged. How expert benchmark statistics may be exploited for automatic performance control is explained.;[Dresp-Langley, Birgitta] Strasbourg Univ, CNRS, UMR 7357, ICube Lab, F-67000 Strasbourg, France;Dresp-Langley, B (corresponding author), Strasbourg Univ, CNRS, UMR 7357, ICube Lab, F-67000 Strasbourg, France.;birgitta.dresp@icube.unistra.fr;Dresp-Langley, Birgitta/F-8243-2013;Dresp-Langley, Birgitta/0000-0002-2860-6472;;;;35;2;3;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2078-2489;;;INFORMATION;Information;DEC;2018;9;12;;;;;;;316;10.3390/info9120316;;;15;Computer Science, Information Systems;Computer Science;HG1KR;WOS:000454713600024;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-02-18;

Then, in order to make a sound decision, the business professional could be supported by a Multi Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) system for taking an external course of action, as, for instance, forecasting a new market or product, up to an inner decision concerning for instance, the volume of manufacture. Thus, managers need, in a collective manner, to analyze the actual problems, to evaluate various options according to diverse criteria, and finally choose the best solution from a set of various alternatives. Throughout these processes, uncertainty and hesitancy easily arise, when it comes to define and judge criteria or alternatives. Several approaches have been introduced to allow Decision Makers (DMs) to deal with. The Interval Multiplicative Preference Relations (IMPRs) approach is a useful technique and the basis of our proposed methodology to provide reliable consistent and in consensus IMPRs. In this manner, DMs' choices are implicitly including their uncertainty while maintaining both an acceptable individual consistency, as well as group consensus levels. The present method is based on some recent results and an optimization algorithm to derive reliable consistent and in consensus IMPRs. In order to illustrate our results and compare them with other methodologies, a few examples are addressed and solved.;[Lopez-Morales, Virgilio] Univ Autonoma Estado Hidalgo, Informat Technol & Syst Res Ctr CITIS, Pachuca 42184, Hidalgo, Mexico;Lopez-Morales, V (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Estado Hidalgo, Informat Technol & Syst Res Ctr CITIS, Pachuca 42184, Hidalgo, Mexico.;virgilio@uaeh.edu.mx;;Lopez_Morales, Virgilio/0000-0003-2043-8766;PFCE-PRODEP grant [DIP/DI/CI/2015-1160];This research was funded by PFCE-PRODEP grant number DIP/DI/CI/2015-1160.;;52;3;3;0;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2078-2489;;;INFORMATION;Information;DEC;2018;9;12;;;;;;;300;10.3390/info9120300;;;26;Computer Science, Information Systems;Computer Science;HG1KR;WOS:000454713600008;;DOAJ Gold;;;2021-02-18;

Indonesia is one of the maritime countries in the world where the water areas are larger than the mainland areas. The success of fish culture was strongly influenced by water quality. Parameters of water quality that influence fish culture are temperature, salinity, pH, oxygen, NH3, NO2, CO2, and water transparency. Determining the suitability of water quality for fish culture is very difficult because not every fish can adapt to it very well. Therefore, it needs a system to help determine the appropriate fish to be cultured based on water quality conditions. This system was created in the form of a computer program with a thinking capability as an expert, known as an expert system. The expert system was developed based on the sequence of steps of knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, and the construction of an expert system shell. Knowledge was achieved from expert, literature, and field study. This knowledge was represented in rule-based representation. Expert system shell was built in C++ language programming. The expert system was developed using backward chaining method to find the appropriate cultured fish under conditions of water quality parameters. Knowledge of the water quality parameters and appropriate cultured fish was stored in a knowledge base. With the expert system, appropriate cultured fish under conditions of water quality parameters can be identified quickly. Hopefully, users will get optimum fish growth.;"[Suwarsito] Univ Muhammadiyah Purwokerto, Geog Educ, Purwokerto 53182, Central Java, Indonesia; [Mustafidah, Hindayati] Univ Muhammadiyah Purwokerto, Informat Engn, Purwokerto 53182, Central Java, Indonesia";Suwarsito (corresponding author), Univ Muhammadiyah Purwokerto, Geog Educ, Purwokerto 53182, Central Java, Indonesia.;;"MUSTAFIDAH, HINDAYATI/T-6398-2018; Suwarsito, Suwarsito/AAE-8709-2021";"MUSTAFIDAH, HINDAYATI/0000-0001-9262-9719; Suwarsito, Suwarsito/0000-0002-5574-2509";DP2M-The Ministry of Research, Technology, and Directorate General of Higher Education (RISTEKDIKTI) through KOPERTIS Region VI;Authors thank to DP2M-The Ministry of Research, Technology, and Directorate General of Higher Education (RISTEKDIKTI) through KOPERTIS Region VI for providing funds to implement this research.;;19;0;0;0;1;AMER SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS;VALENCIA;26650 THE OLD RD, STE 208, VALENCIA, CA 91381-0751 USA;1936-6612;1936-7317;;ADV SCI LETT;Adv.

Secondly, the fuzzy system is formed by setting the intervals for fuzzy variables and extracted rules. Finally, Cuckoo Search algorithm is used to optimize fuzzy membership functions. The accuracy of our proposed system is evaluated using Cleveland Cardiac Patient Database. The detection rate is 93.48% employing optimized membership functions. Also, 85.76% accuracy is obtained for predicting the risk of coronary artery disease.

The aim of this study was to investigate MCV genome infection in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: This retrospective, case-control study used archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from colorectal cancer patients (cases) and matched healthy subjects (controls) diagnosed by an expert pathologist from hospitals affiliated with Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran from 2011 to 2016. After DNA extraction with a QIAamp (R) DNA FFPE Tissue Kit, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for diagnosis. A positive control was produced by cloning with the Generay Biotechnology system. SPSS v.22 was used for analysis of demographic variables. Results: There were 157 participants included in the study: 66 were cases and 91 were controls. Their mean ages (+/- SD) were 59.35 +/- 14.48 and 57.21 +/- 14.66, respectively. The proportion of males was 57.6% in the case group and 57.1% in the control group. None of the samples were positive for MCV expression by real-time PCR assay. Association was detected between males with CRC and tumor location in the rectum and between males with CRC and the mucinous tumor type. Conclusion: None of the tissues from the CRC or non-cancerous control groups were positive for MCV genome infection, although a low viral load, the sample type, or the method of use should not be neglected.

In Solar Power and Chemical Energy Systems (SolarPACES) Task III, an international group of experts is drafting the reflectance guidelines and debating the hard task of measuring off-normal near-specular solar-reflectance. Because of the lack of suitable commercial instruments, several research institutes are studying and setting up special equipment. Since 2012, the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA) proposed an articulated strategy based on modeling the hemispherical spectral reflectance with the equivalent model algorithm and the ratio of near-specular to hemispherical reflectance with the total integral scattering equation; in the latter, the roughness is replaced by the heuristic parameter sigma(phi), nonphysically dependent on the acceptance angle. The solar mirror qualification experimental setup was conceived for measuring sigma(phi). Recently, SolarPACES approved a new project to support the working group for improving the proposed instruments. The paper summarizes the ENEA strategy and presents the latest version of the instrument, SMQ2, discussing its several important new features: self-calibration, setup simplification, straightforward applicability to high specular mirrors, measurement-time cutoff, and acceptance-angle range extended up to 50 mrad.

Understanding brain dynamics, control of behavior and mental processes is the ultimate challenge for science. It requires multi-level explanations, starting from evolutionary pressures, genes, proteins, cells, networks of neurons, psychophysics, subjective experiences at the mental level, and social interactions. Many branches of science contribute to this endeavor. Physics provides experimental and theoretical tools at the molecular and brain signal processing level, and mathematical tools at the level of neurodynamics. Inspirations from understanding brains are of great practical importance in many fields, including neuropsychiatry, neuropsychology and artificial intelligence. Neurodynamics provides the best language to link low-level molecular phenomena to high-level cognitive functions. Computational simulations help to understand molecular dynamics and analyze real brain signals.

Physicians can observe cellular internal structures abnormalities by visualizing and analyzing images. Leukemia is a malignant disease characterized by the uncontrolled accumulation of abnormal white blood cells. The recognition of acute leukemia blast cells in colored microscopic images is a challenging task. The first important step in the automatic recognition of this disease, image segmentation, is considered to be the most critical step. In this study, we present a decision support system that includes the panel selection, segmentation using K-means clustering to identify the leukemia cells and features extraction, and image refinement. After the decision support system successfully identifies the cells and its internal structure, the cells are classified according to their morphological features of this analysis the decision support system was tested using a public dataset designed to test segmentation techniques for identifying specific cells, and the results of this analysis were compared with those of other techniques, which were suggested by other researchers, applied to the same data. The algorithm was then applied to another dataset, extracted under the supervision by an expert pathologist, from a local hospital; the total dataset consisted of 757 images gathered from two datasets. The images of the datasets are labeled with three different labels, which represents three types of leukemia cells: blast, myelocyte, and segmented cells. The process of labeling of these images was revised by the expert pathologist.

A new generation of resilience-based planning processes has emerged in the last several years that integrate goals of community well-being and identity into recovery-based performance measurement frameworks. Specific tools and refined guidance are needed to facilitate evidence-based development of recovery estimates. This article presents the participatory modeling process, a planning system designed to develop recovery-based resilience measurement frameworks for community resilience planning initiatives. Stakeholder engagement is infused throughout the participatory modeling process by integrating disaster recovery simulation modeling into community resilience planning. Within the process, participants get a unique opportunity to work together to deliberate on community concerns through facilitated participatory modeling. The participatory modeling platform combines the DESaster recovery simulation model and visual analytics interfaces. DESaster is an open source Python Library for creating discrete event simulations of disaster recovery. The simulation model was developed using a human-centered design approach whose goal is to be open, modular, and extensible. The process presented in this article is the first participatory modeling approach for analyzing recovery to aid creation of community resilience measurement frameworks.;[Miles, Scott B.] Univ Washington, Dept Human Ctr Design & Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA;Miles, SB (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Human Ctr Design & Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;milessb@uw.edu;;;National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1560939, 1541025];Funding support for this article was provided by National Science Foundation Awards #1560939 and #1541025.;;52;7;7;4;11;SPRINGEROPEN;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND;2095-0055;2192-6395;;INT J DISAST RISK SC;Int.

Investigators need to keep pace with these technological advances for electronic data capture (EDC) systems to be appropriately executed and utilized at full capacity in research settings. Mobile technology allows EDC systems to collect near real-time data from study participants, deliver intervention directly to participants' mobile devices, monitor staff activity, and facilitate near real-time decision making during study implementation. Objective: This paper presents the infrastructure of an EDC system designed to support a multisite HIV biobehavioral intervention trial in Los Angeles and New Orleans: the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network Comprehensive Adolescent Research & Engagement Studies (ATN CARES). We provide an overview of how multiple EDC functions can be integrated into a single EDC system to support large-scale intervention trials. Methods: The CARES EDC system is designed to monitor and document multiple study functions, including, screening, recruitment, retention, intervention delivery, and outcome assessment. Text messaging (short message service, SMS)and nearly all data collection are supported by the EDC system. The system functions on mobile phones, tablets, and Web browsers. Results: ATN CARES is enrolling study participants and collecting baseline and follow-up data through the EDC system. Besides data collection, the EDC system is being used to generate multiple reports that inform recruitment planning, budgeting, intervention quality, and field staff supervision. The system is supporting both incoming and outgoing text messages (SMS) and offers high-level data security. Intervention design details are also influenced by EDC system platform capabilities and constraints. Challenges of using EDC systems are addressed through programming updates and training on how to improve data quality. Conclusions: There are three key considerations in the development of an EDC system for an intervention trial. First, it needs to be decided whether the flexibility provided by the development of a study-specific, in-house EDC system is needed relative to the utilization of an existing commercial platform that requires less in-house programming expertise. Second, a single EDC system may not provide all functionality. ATN CARES is using a main EDC system for data collection, text messaging (SMS) interventions, and case management and a separate Web-based platform to support an online peer support intervention. Decisions need to be made regarding the functionality that is crucial for the EDC system to handle and what functionality can be handled by other systems. Third, data security is a priority but needs to be balanced with the need for flexible intervention delivery. For example, ATN CARES is delivering text messages (SMS) to study participants' mobile phones. EDC data security protocols should be developed under guidance from security experts and with formative consulting with the target study population as to their perceptions and needs.;"[Comulada, W.

Increased contact with primary care before the suicide or attempted suicide raises opportunities for intervention and prevention. However, suicide assessment and management are areas that many general practitioners (GPs) find particularly challenging. Previous research has indicated significant variability in how GPs understand, operationalize, and assess suicide risk, which subsequently has an impact on clinical decision making. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been widely implemented across different health care settings, including primary care to support practitioners in clinical decision making. A CDSS may reduce inconsistencies in the identification, assessment, and management of suicide risk by GPs by guiding them through the consultation and generating a risk assessment plan that can be shared with a service user or with specialized mental health services. Objective: Our aim is to co-develop and test with end users (eg, GPs, primary care attendees, mental health professionals) an electronic clinical decision support system (e-CDSS) to support GPs in the identification, assessment, and management of suicidality in primary care. Methods: Ours is an ongoing embedded mixed-methods study with four phases: (1) qualitative interviews with GPs to explore their views on the content, format, and use of the e-CDSS, as well as consultation with two service-user advisory groups (people aged <= 25 and people aged >= 25) to inform the content of the e-CDSS including phrasing of items and clarity; (2) participatory co-production workshops with GPs, service users, and clinical experts in suicidality to determine the content and format of the e-CDDS; gain consensus of the relevance of items; establish content validity and identify pathways to implementation, using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research; (3) building the e-CDSS so that it guides the GP through a consultation; and (4) usability testing of the e-CDSS with GPs and service users in one primary care practice involving a nonlive and a live stage. Results: The study was funded for four years, to take place between 2015 and 2019, and is currently completing phase 4 data collection. The first results are expected to be submitted for publication in June 2019. The findings will enable us to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of a suicide-specific, electronic, guided decision support system in primary care. Conclusions: This study will be the first to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of an electronic, guided decision support system for use in primary care consultations for the improved assessment and management of suicidality.";"[Horrocks, Matthew; Aubeeluck, Aimee; Wright, Nicola; Morriss, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Sch Med, Div Psychiat & Appl Psychol, Inst Mental Hlth, Jubilee Campus,Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG7 2TU, England; [Horrocks, Matthew] Univ Nottingham, Sch Hlth Sci, Nottingham, England; [Michail, Maria] Univ Birmingham, Inst Mental Hlth, Sch Psychol, Birmingham, W Midlands, England";Horrocks, M (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Med, Div Psychiat & Appl Psychol, Inst Mental Hlth, Jubilee Campus,Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG7 2TU, England.;matthew.horrocks@nottingham.ac.uk;Horrocks, Matthew/AAG-3639-2020;"Horrocks, Matthew/0000-0002-7620-0100; aubeeluck, aimee/0000-0003-3388-049X; Michail, Maria/0000-0001-7380-3494";"National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (East Midlands); East Midlands Patient Safety Collaborative";This research is funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (East Midlands) and the East Midlands Patient Safety Collaborative.

Objective: In this work, we describe a method combing support vector machine (SVM) and multi-feature fusion for assessing the signal quality of pulsatile waveforms, concentrating on the photoplethysmogram (PPG). Methods: PPG signals from 53 healthy volunteers were recorded. Each had a 5 min length. Signal quality in each heart beat was manual annotated by clinical expert, and then the signal quality in 5 s episode was automatically calculated according to the results from each beat segments, resulting in a total of 13,294 5-s PPG segments. Then a SVM was trained to classify clean/noisy PPG recordings by inputting a set of twelve signal quality features. Further experiments were carried out to verify the proposed SVM based signal quality classifier method. Results: An average accuracy of 87.90%, a sensitivity of 88.10% and a specificity of 87.66% were found on the 10-fold cross validation.

All potential complications of cancer therapy onto the cardiovascular system require imaging for diagnostic workup as well as monitoring of therapy. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the most frequently used tool for assessment of cardiac function during or after cancer therapy in daily clinical routine. With modern techniques like strain analysis, echocardiography allows to detect a variety of cardiac diseases as caused by cancer therapy even at subclinical stages. For further workup, specific imaging techniques including nuclear imaging are needed in a multimodality imaging approach to in detail characterize the underlying pathophysiology and to improve the management of the patients. Therefore, the field of imaging in cardio-oncology is rapidly growing. This review article will give an overview about existing literature regarding the role of imaging in the diagnostic evaluation and management of therapy in patient with prior or ongoing cancer therapy.;"[Mahabadi, Amir Abbas] Univ Hosp Essen, West German Heart & Vasc Ctr, Dept Cardiol & Vasc Med, Essen, Germany; [Rischpler, Christoph] Univ Duisburg Essen, Univ Hosp Essen, Dept Nucl Med, Essen, Germany";Mahabadi, AA (corresponding author), Hufelandstr 55, D-45147 Essen, Germany.;amir-abbas.mahabadi@uk-essen.de;Mahabadi, Amir/ABE-6057-2020;;;;;111;3;3;0;4;AME PUBL CO;SHATIN;FLAT-RM C 16F, KINGS WING PLAZA 1, NO 3 KWAN ST, SHATIN, HONG KONG 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA;2072-1439;2077-6624;;J THORAC DIS;J.

Classical chemotherapy, targeted and immune therapies as wells as radiotherapy challenge the cardiovascular system at multiple levels, including increased rates of e.g., hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, and thrombosis. The cardiologist working within the cardio-oncology team is confronted with a broad spectrum of therapies and combination protocols. Evidence from the past few years implicate that at least 30 novel cancer drugs can be expected to receive approval each year. The rate and extent of cardiovascular complications particularly for these new therapies remains to be evaluated. Overall, cardio-oncology has several important tasks to establish an optimal care for cancer patients: (I) risk assessment before therapy to prevent onset of cardiovascular disease, (II) assessment of diagnostic pathways to provide a timely diagnosis of early stages of cardiovascular complications, (III) characterize the extent of morbidity and mortality as induced by cancer therapies, (IV) establish therapeutic options to treat cardiotoxicity and (V) monitor long-term cancer survivors. In this special edition, experts in the field provide an overview about key concepts in cardio-oncology. This is complemented by general considerations about novel concepts in cardio-oncology including the establishment of fellowship programs, ethical issue and cancer survivorship programs as outlined in the present review.;"[Rassaf, Tienush; Totzeck, Matthias] Univ Hosp Essen, Fac Med, West German Heart & Vasc Ctr, Dept Cardiol & Vasc Med, Hufelandstr 55, D-45147 Essen, Germany";Rassaf, T (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Essen, Fac Med, West German Heart & Vasc Ctr, Dept Cardiol & Vasc Med, Hufelandstr 55, D-45147 Essen, Germany.;Tienush.Rassaf@uk-essen.de;;;;;;31;6;7;0;0;AME PUBL CO;SHATIN;FLAT-RM C 16F, KINGS WING PLAZA 1, NO 3 KWAN ST, SHATIN, HONG KONG 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA;2072-1439;2077-6624;;J THORAC DIS;J.

Understanding these differences is key to developing upgrading strategies (UPS) that can help stabilise and enhance food security. This is highly relevant for research on food value chains (FVCs) in sub-Saharan Africa, where subsistence farmers are highly exposed to food insecurity. Prior to their implementation, however, the potential social, ecological and economic impacts of UPS in the target areas should be carefully assessed. This article reports on gender-based differences in perception and evaluates these differences using ex-ante impact assessments on the social, ecological, and economic aspects of food security and 13 UPS in the Tanzanian FVC that were carried out by agricultural scientists. The work is embedded in a larger multi-disciplinary research project. We find that impact assessments differed based on the gender of experts to various extents and depended on the types of criteria assessed. Female scientists were more careful during assessment, limiting themselves more strictly to the UPS and to criteria they were most knowledgeable in. Additionally, female respondents perceived the impacts of UPS on the economic and social sustainability of food security to be lower compared to their male colleagues. We therefore conclude that perceptions of female and male agricultural experts in strategy selection and implementation should be differentiated based on their gender. This may help reduce gender specific challenges faced by African farmers.;"[Graef, F.; Uckert, G.] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF eV, Muncheberg, Germany";Graef, F (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF eV, Muncheberg, Germany.;graef@zalf.de;;Uckert, Gotz Bernhard/0000-0002-4359-5871;"project Trans-SEC [031A249A]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)";This publication is a product of the project Trans-SEC (www.trans-sec.org) under grant No. 031A249A.

Multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation in pregnancy has been implemented in select countries and emerging evidence suggests that MMN supplementation in pregnancy may provide additional benefits compared to IFA alone. In 2015, WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the Micronutrient Initiative held a Technical Consultation on MMN supplements in pregnancy: implementation considerations for successful incorporation into existing programmemes, which included a call for indicators needed for monitoring, evaluation, and surveillance of MMN supplementation programmes. Currently, global surveillance and monitoring data show that overall IFA supplementation programmes suffer from low coverage and intake adherence, despite inclusion in national policies. Common barriers that limit the effectiveness of IFA-which also apply to MMN programmes-include weak supply chains, low access to antenatal care services, low-quality behaviour change interventions to support and motivate women, and weak or non-existent monitoring systems used for programme improvement. The causes of these barriers in a given country need careful review to resolve them. As countries heighten their focus on supplementation during pregnancy, or if they decide to initiate or transition into MMN supplementation, a priority is to identify key monitoring indicators to address these issues and support effective programmes. National and global monitoring and surveillance data on IFA supplementation during pregnancy are primarily derived from cross-sectional surveys and, on a more routine basis, through health and logistics management information systems. Indicators for IFA supplementation exist; however, the new indicators for MMN supplementation need to be incorporated. We reviewed practice-based evidence, guided by the WHO/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention logic model for vitamin and mineral interventions in public health programmes, and used existing manuals, published literature, country reports, and the opinion of experts, to identify monitoring, evaluation, and surveillance indicators for MMN supplementation programmes. We also considered cross-cutting indicators that could be used across programme settings, as well as those specific to common delivery models, such as antenatal care services. We then described mechanisms for collecting these data, including integration within existing government monitoring systems, as well as other existing or proposed systems. Monitoring data needs at all stages of the programme lifecycle were considered, as well as the feasibility and cost of data collection. We also propose revisions to global-, national-, and subnational-surveillance indicators based on these reviews.";"[Mei, Zuguo; Jefferds, Maria Elena; Suchdev, Parminder S.; Flores-Ayala, Rafael C.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent CDC, Natl Ctr Chron Dis Prevent & Hlth Promot, Div Nutr Phys Act & Obes, Atlanta, GA USA; [Namaste, Sorrel] SPRING, Arlington, VA USA; [Namaste, Sorrel] Helen Keller Int, New York, NY USA";Mei, ZG (corresponding author), Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Mailstop F-77,4770 Buford Highway, Atlanta, GA 30341 USA.;zmei@cdc.gov;Suchdev, Parmi S/K-4851-2012;Jefferds, Maria Elena/0000-0002-2652-4502;"United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesCenters for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; United States Agency for International Development (USAID)United States Agency for International Development (USAID)";"United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); United States Agency for International Development (USAID)";;34;2;2;0;2;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1740-8695;1740-8709;;MATERN CHILD NUTR;Matern.

Despite FO-PID controllers outperforming integer order (IO) ones in many cases, the latter continues to dominate industrial utilization. One of the big barriers which confine adoption of FO-PID controllers is the complexity of the current tuning methods for industrial application. In this paper, a practical tuning method for FO-PID controllers is introduced. In this line, classical loop-shaping tools are utilized to propose this new simple tuning rule. A rule of thumb and a guideline are given for non-expert and industrial users for controlling motion systems.

Approach: An ECG-derived respiration (EDR) signal and synchronous beat-tobeat heart rate variability (HRV) time series were derived from the ECG using previously described robust algorithms. A measure of cardiorespiratory coupling (CRC) was extracted by calculating the coherence and cross-spectrogram of the EDR and HRV signal in 5 min windows. A CNN was then trained to classify the sleep stages (wake, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) light sleep and NREM deep sleep) from the corresponding CRC spectrograms. A support vector machine was then used to combine the output of CNN with the other features derived from the ECG, including phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA), sample entropy, as well as standard spectral and temporal HRV measures. The MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database (SLPDB), the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2018 database (CinC2018) and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) database, all expert-annotated for sleep stages, were used to train and validate the algorithm. Main results: Ten-fold cross validation results showed that the proposed algorithm achieved an accuracy (Acc) of 75.4% and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of kappa = 0.54 on the out of sample validation data in the classification of Wake, REM, NREM light and deep sleep in SLPDB. This rose to Acc = 81.6% and kappa = 0.63 for the classification of Wake, REM sleep and NREM sleep and Acc = 85.1% and kappa = 0.68 for the classification of NREM sleep versus REM/wakefulness in SLPDB. Significance: The proposed ECG-based sleep stage classification approach that represents the highest reported results on non-electroencephalographic data and uses datasets over ten times larger than those in previous studies. By using a state-of-the-art QRS detector and deep learning model, the system does not require human annotation and can therefore be scaled for mass analysis.;"[Li, Qiao; Nemati, Shamim; Clifford, Gari D.] Emory Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Li, Qichen] Univ Oxford, Dept Engn Sci, Oxford, England; [Liu, Chengyu] Southeast Univ, Sch Instrument Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shashikumar, P.] Georgia Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Clifford, Gari D.] Georgia Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA";"Clifford, GD (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.; Clifford, GD (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.";gari@physionet.org;;"Clifford, Gari/0000-0002-5709-201X; Liu, Chengyu/0000-0003-1965-3020";"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [NIH 5R01HL136205, R24 HL114473, U01HL53916, U01HL53931, U01HL53934, U01HL53937, U01HL53938, U01HL53940, U01HL53941, U01HL64360]; National Heart, Lung, and Blood InstituteUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI); Emory University; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R24HL114473, R01HL136205, R01HL136205, R24HL114473, R01HL136205] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) [K01ES025445, K01ES025445, K01ES025445, K01ES025445] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";The authors wish to acknowledge the National Institutes of Health (Grant #NIH 5R01HL136205), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Emory University for their financial support of this research.

Training to proactively discuss implementation of control and prevention strategies are beneficial in that they provide stakeholders with the practical information and educational experience they will need to respond effectively to an FAD. Such proactive approaches are the mission of the Secure Food System (SFS; University of Minnesota; St. Paul, Minnesota USA). Methods: The SFS exercises were designed as educational activities based on avian influenza (AI) outbreaks in commercial poultry scenarios. These scenarios were created by subject matter experts and were based on epidemiology reports, risk pathway analyses, local industry practices, and site-specific circumstances. Target audiences of an exercise were the groups involved in FAD control: animal agriculture industry members; animal health regulators; and diagnosticians. Groups of industry participants seated together at tables represented fictional poultry premises and were guided by a moderator to respond to an on-farm situation within a simulated outbreak. The impact of SFS exercises was evaluated through interviews with randomized industry participants and selected table moderators. Descriptive statistics and qualitative analyses were performed on interview feedback. Results: Eleven SFS exercises occurred from December 2016 through October 2017 in multiple regions of the US. Exercises were conducted as company-wide, state-wide, or regional trainings. Nine were based on highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks and two focused on outbreaks of co-circulating HPAI and low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI). Poultry industry participants interviewed generally found attending an SFS exercise to be useful. The most commonly identified benefits of participation were its value to people without prior outbreak experience and knowledge gained about Continuity of Business (COB)-permitted movement. After completing an exercise, most participants evaluated their preparedness to respond to an outbreak as somewhat to very ready, and more than one-half reported their respective company or farms had discussions or changed actions due to participation. Conclusion: Evaluation feedback suggests the SFS exercises were an effective training method to supplement preparedness efforts for an AI outbreak. The concept of using multi-faceted scenarios and multiple education strategies during a tabletop exercise may be translatable to other emergency preparedness needs.";"[Linskens, Eric J.; Walz, Emily J.; St Charles, Kaitlyn M.; Ssematimba, Amos; Halvorson, David A.; Cardona, Carol J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Vet & Biomed Sci, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Neu, Abby E.] Univ Minnesota, Extens, Willmar, MN USA; [Culhane, Marie R.; Goldsmith, Timothy J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Vet Populat Med, St Paul, MN 55108 USA";Cardona, CJ (corresponding author), 1971 Commonwealth Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.;ccardona@umn.edu;Ssematimba, Amos/S-3217-2019;Ssematimba, Amos/0000-0002-5407-2478;;;;21;2;2;0;2;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA;1049-023X;1945-1938;;PREHOSP DISASTER MED;Prehospital Disaster Med.;DEC;2018;33;6;;;;;640;646;;10.1017/S1049023X18000717;;;7;Emergency Medicine;Emergency Medicine;HF4MB;WOS:000454206200013;30210015;;;;2021-02-18;

They enable systems modeling in a theory-driven way, grounded in expert judgment and understanding. This article presents the EXIT approach, a novel modeling technique and a computational method for structural cross-impact analysis. EXIT extracts insights from an expert-sourced cross-impact model, which describes the structure of direct interactions within a system. The EXIT transformation produces a relative quantification of the emergent, systemic relationships between model components, effectuating over the complex web of interactions in the system. Compared to the more established matrix multiplication approach, EXIT produces novel and more detailed analytical outputs on the basis of similar input, and offers new analytical possibilities in structural cross-impact analysis.

The forecasts covered diverse systems ranging from unmanned systems to guns to missiles to electronic warfare. This paper offers a quantitative assessment of the accuracy of this group of forecasts. The overall accuracy - by several measures - was assessed as quite high. In particular, when measured by the expert-assessed accuracy of the forecast statements, the average accuracy is 0.76. This points to the potential value of such forecasts in managing investments in long-term research and development. Major differences in accuracy, with strong statistical significance, were found between forecasts pertaining primarily to information acquisition and processing technologies, as opposed to technologies that aim primarily at physical effects. This paper also proposes several recommendations regarding methodological aspects of forecast accuracy assessments. Although the assessments were restricted to information available in open literature, the expert assessors did not find this constraint a significant detriment to the assessment process.;"[Kott, Alexander; Perconti, Philip] US Army Res Lab, Adelphi, MD USA";Kott, A (corresponding author), US Army Res Lab, RDRL D, 2800 Powder Mill Rd, Adelphi, MD 20783 USA.;alexander.kottl.civ@mail.mil;;;;;;42;2;2;1;12;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA;0040-1625;1873-5509;;TECHNOL FORECAST SOC;Technol.

Most existing frameworks on the assessment of such technological advancements see the technology as a solitary system. However, research has shown that other environmental factors like organizational processes or human factors are also affected. Drawing on the sociotechnical systems approach, future technologies could be evaluated using scenarios of digitized work. These scenarios can help classify new technologies and uncover their advantages and constraints in order to provide guidance for the digital development of organizations. We developed an instrument for evaluating scenarios of digitized work on the relevant dimensions 'technology', 'human' and 'organization' and conducted a quantitative study applying this instrument on three different scenarios (N = 24 subject matter experts). Results show that our instrument is capable of measuring technological, human and organizational aspects of technology implementations and detecting differences in the scenarios under investigation. The instrument's practical value is significant as it enables the user to compare and quantify scenarios and helps companies to decide which technology they should implement.;"[Mlekus, Lisa; Paruzel, Agnieszka; Bentler, Dominik; Maier, Guenter W.] Bielefeld Univ, Fac Psychol & Sports Sci, Work & Org Psychol, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Jenderny, Sascha; Roecker, Carsten] Fraunhofer Inst Optron Syst Technol & Image Explo, Ind Automat Branch, D-32657 Lemgo, Germany; [Foullois, Marc; Bansmann, Michael; Woeste, Lars] Fraunhofer Inst Mechatron Syst Design, D-33102 Paderborn, Germany";Mlekus, L (corresponding author), Bielefeld Univ, Fac Psychol & Sports Sci, Work & Org Psychol, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.;"lisa.mlekus@uni-bielefeld.de; a.paruzel@uni-bielefeld.de; dominik.bentler@uni-bielefeld.de; sascha.jenderny@iosb-ina.fraunhofer.de; marc.foullois@iem.fraunhofer.de; michael.bansmann@iem.fraunhofer.de; lars.woeste@iem.fraunhofer.de; Carsten.roecker@iosb-ina.fraunhofer.de; ao-psychologie@uni-bielefeld.de";;Bentler, Dominik/0000-0003-0311-9253;"Bundesministerium fur Bildung und ForschungFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF) [01FI16133]";This research was funded by Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung and European Social Fund, grant number 01FI16133.;;60;2;2;0;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2227-7080;;;TECHNOLOGIES;Technologies;DEC;2018;6;4;;;;;;;120;10.3390/technologies6040120;;;19;Engineering, Multidisciplinary;Engineering;HF6HC;WOS:000454335200032;;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-02-18;

The application of different machine learning techniques including regression analysis, deep learning neural networks, and fuzzy rule-based models has already been investigated. In this paper, a novel method based on Fuzzy Finite State Machine (FFSM) integrated with the learning capabilities of Neural Networks (NNs) is proposed to represent human activities in an intelligent environment. The proposed approach, called Neuro-Fuzzy Finite State Machine (N-FFSM), is able to learn the parameters of a rule-based fuzzy system, which processes the numerical input/output data gathered from the sensors and/or human experts' knowledge. Generating fuzzy rules that represent the transition between states leads to assigning a degree of transition from one state to another. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The model is tested and evaluated using a dataset collected from a real home environment. The results show the effectiveness of using this method for modelling the activities of daily living based on ambient sensory datasets. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the standard NNs and FFSM techniques.;"[Mohmed, Gadelhag; Lotfi, Ahmad; Pourabdollah, Amir] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Clifton Lane, Nottingham NG11 8NS, England";Lotfi, A (corresponding author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Clifton Lane, Nottingham NG11 8NS, England.;"gadelhag.mohmed2016@my.ntu.ac.uk; ahmad.lotfi@ntu.ac.uk; amir.pourabdollah@ntu.ac.uk";Lotfi, Ahmad/D-4260-2009;"Lotfi, Ahmad/0000-0002-5139-6565; Pourabdollah, Amir/0000-0001-7737-1393";;;;39;2;2;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2227-7080;;;TECHNOLOGIES;Technologies;DEC;2018;6;4;;;;;;;110;10.3390/technologies6040110;;;16;Engineering, Multidisciplinary;Engineering;HF6HC;WOS:000454335200022;;DOAJ Gold, Green Accepted;;;2021-02-18;

Methods: A total of 60,407 OCT images were labeled by 17 licensed retinal experts and 25,134 images were included. One hundred one-layer convolutional neural networks (ResNet) were trained for the categorization. We applied 10-fold cross-validation method to train and optimize our algorithms. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy and kappa value were calculated to evaluate the performance of the intelligent system in categorizing OCT images. We also compared the performance of the system with results obtained by two experts. Results: The intelligent system achieved an AUC of 0.984 with an accuracy of 0.959 in detecting macular hole, cystoid macular edema, epiretinal membrane, and serous macular detachment. Specifically, the accuracies in discriminating normal images, cystoid macular edema, serous macular detachment, epiretinal membrane, and macular hole were 0.973, 0.848, 0.947, 0.957, and 0.978, respectively. The system had a kappa value of 0.929, while the two physicians' kappa values were 0.882 and 0.889 independently. Conclusions: This deep learning-based system is able to automatically detect and differentiate various OCT images with excellent accuracy. Moreover, the performance of the system is at a level comparable to or better than that of human experts. This study is a promising step in revolutionizing current disease diagnostic pattern and has the potential to generate a significant clinical impact.

The paper draws on research to investigate equity implications of current PHF involvement in PHC in Australia. We reviewed literature, analysed documents relating to a Senate Committee inquiry and interviewed stakeholders and experts in private health insurance policy from government, private sector and nongovernment organisations. Involvement of PHFs in the PHC sector in Australia is increasing, presenting risk of increased inequities in access to PHC based on insurance status, which could undermine the universality of PHC under Medicare. However, some stakeholders think these risks can be managed within current policy arrangements. There are also risks for quality of PHC services arising from greater involvement of PHFs in service delivery and preferred provider models. Differing stakeholder views on equity implications of PHF involvement in PHC are associated with different views on desirable policy action. We conclude that there is a risk of increased involvement of PHFs in PHC risks exacerbating existing inequities in the health system, but this is moderated by public support for Medicare.;"[Windle, Alice; Fisher, Matthew; Freeman, Toby; Baum, Fran; Javanparast, Sara] Flinders Univ S Australia, Southgate Inst Hlth Soc & Equ, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Kay, Adrian] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Kidd, Michael] Univ Toronto, Fac Med, Toronto, ON, Canada";Windle, A (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Southgate Inst Hlth Soc & Equ, Adelaide, SA, Australia.;alice.windle@flinders.edu.au;;"Fisher, Matthew/0000-0003-3756-1146; Freeman, Toby/0000-0002-2787-8580; Javanparast, Sara/0000-0002-0388-5524; Baum, Fran/0000-0002-2294-1368";National Health and Medical Research CouncilNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP1078046];National Health and Medical Research Council APP1078046;;32;1;1;0;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1839-4655;;;AUST J SOC ISSUES;Aust.

Corporate governance is present in large organizations, which we call joint stock companies in BiH. The organization's workflow, dividend payments, and day-to-day operations are monitored by people in charge of corporate governance. On the other hand, within each organization, and so on the corporations, a certain organizational culture is introduced, which is specific, and it is essentially known only by employees of a certain company. How much the real impact of organizational culture on corporate governance in BiH companies will be seen in the paper that follows. Corporative management is a form of governance that is characteristical for corporations, or for joint stock companies. Corporate governance, as a set of mechanisms by one corporation, grows and develops on the market, is of fundamental importance to developed countries of the world (United States - US, United Kingdom - UK, Germany, Canada, France and Japan). In the case of lower organizational forms of companies, capital owners often also make their management-management structure. The corporation represents such an organizational form of companies where there is a large number of capital owners whose ability to manage such an entity is insufficient, so they are required to engage professionally competent experts outside the business community (managers) to which they delegate the right to manage and manage. Organizational culture is a special form of culture that includes certain customs, attitudes, values, traditions and rituals. Organizational culture encompasses a system of ideas and concepts, customs, traditions, procedures and habits for acting in special macroeconomics.

First assessments of investment climate were developed and applied by western experts in the middle of the 1960s. They were based on the subjective assessment of countries' characteristics. The further development of the methodology for comparative assessment of countries' investment climate started to expand and complicate the system of characteristics assessed by experts, and to introduce objective statistical indexes. In recent decades, more research into investment climate at the level of regions appeared, as a result of the understanding of a specific and unique character of regional features, as well as its dramatic differences from the country as a whole.

In addition, for modeling real-world application, it is necessary to compute the values of the parameters of the environment (transition probabilities and observation probabilities) and the reward functions, which are typically, hand-tuned by experts in the field until it has acquired a satisfactory value. This results in an undesired process. To address these shortcomings, this paper provides a new Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for computing the mean-variance customer portfolio with transaction costs in controllable Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). The solution is restricted to finite state, action, observation sets and average reward problems. For solving this problem, a controller/actor-critic architecture is proposed, which balance the difficult tasks of exploitation and exploration of the environment. The architecture consists of three modules: controller, fast-tracked portfolio learning and an actor-critic module. Each module involves the design of a convergent Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm. We employ three different learning rules to estimate the real values of: (a) the transition matrices (pi) over cap (j vertical bar ik) (t), (b) the rewards (J) over cap((ijk))(t) and (c) the resources destined for carrying out a promotion (zeta) over cap((i) over cap vertical bar (k) over cap ) (t). We present a proof for the estimated transition matrix rule (pi) over cap (j vertical bar ik) (t) and showing that it converges when t -> infinity. For solving the optimization programming problem we extend the c-variable method for partially observable Markov chains. The c-variable is conceptualized as joint strategy given by the product of the control policy, the observation kernel Q(y vertical bar s) and the stationary distribution vector. A major advantage of this procedure is that it can be implemented efficiently for real settings in controllable POMDP. A numerical example illustrates the results of the proposed method.;"[Asiain, Erick; Poznyak, Alexander S.] Ctr Res & Adv Studies, Dept Control Automat, Av IPN 2508, Mexico City 07360, DF, Mexico; [Clempner, Julio B.] Inst Politecn Nacl, Escuela Super Fis & Matemat, Bldg 9,Av Inst Politecn Nacl, Mexico City 07738, DF, Mexico; [Clempner, Julio B.] Natl Polytech Inst, Sch Phys & Math, Mexico City, DF, Mexico";"Clempner, JB (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Escuela Super Fis & Matemat, Bldg 9,Av Inst Politecn Nacl, Mexico City 07738, DF, Mexico.; Clempner, JB (corresponding author), Natl Polytech Inst, Sch Phys & Math, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.";"easiain@ctrl.cinvestav.mx; julio@clempner.name; apoznyak@ctrl.cinvestav.mx";Poznyak, Alexander/U-1729-2019;Asiain, Erick/0000-0003-4386-8646;;;;49;4;4;1;5;WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD;SINGAPORE;5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE;0218-2130;1793-6349;;INT J ARTIF INTELL T;Int.

The algorithm is part of a system suitable for longterm monitoring in a home environment, which should support experts analysing sleep. Approach: As there is a strong correlation between bio-vital signals and sleep stages, multinomial logistic regression was chosen for categorical distribution of sleep stages. Several derived parameters of three signals (respiratory, heart rate and movement) are input for the proposed method. Sleep recordings of five subjects were used for the training of a machine learning model and 30 overnight recordings collected from 30 individuals with about 27 000 epochs of 30 s intervals each were evaluated. Main results: The achieved rate of accuracy is 72% for Wake, NREM, REM (with Cohen's kappa value 0.67) and 58% for Wake, Light (N1 and N2), Deep (N3) and REM stages (Cohen's kappa is 0.50). Our approach has confirmed the potential of this method and disclosed several ways for its improvement. Significance: The results indicate that respiratory, heart rate and movement signals can be used for sleep studies with a reasonable level of accuracy. These inputs can be obtained in a non-invasive way applying it in a home environment. The proposed system introduces a convenient approach for a long-term monitoring system which could support sleep laboratories. The algorithm which was developed allows for an easy adjustment of input parameters that depend on available signals and for this reason could also be used with various hardware systems.;"[Gaiduk, Maksym; Seepold, Ralf] HTWG Konstanz, Constance, Germany; [Penzel, Thomas] Charite Clin, Interdisciplinary Ctr Sleep Med, Berlin, Germany; [Gaiduk, Maksym; Antonio Ortega, Juan] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [Seepold, Ralf] Sechenov Univ, Dept Informat & Internet Technol, Moscow, Russia";"Gaiduk, M (corresponding author), HTWG Konstanz, Constance, Germany.; Gaiduk, M (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.";maksym.gaiduk@htwg-konstanz.de;"Penzel, Thomas/M-2344-2014; ORTEGA, JUAN ANTONIO/F-2457-2010; Gaiduk, Maksym/AAA-5110-2020; Seepold, Ralf/Y-2510-2018";"Penzel, Thomas/0000-0002-4304-0112; ORTEGA, JUAN ANTONIO/0000-0001-9095-7241; Gaiduk, Maksym/0000-0001-9607-5709; Seepold, Ralf/0000-0002-5192-2537";"EU Interreg V-Program 'Alpenrhein-Bodensee-Hochrhein' by the European Fund for Regional Development (EFRE); Federal State of Switzerland: Project 'IBH Living Lab Active and Assisted Living' [ABH40, ABH66]";This research was partially funded by the EU Interreg V-Program 'Alpenrhein-Bodensee-Hochrhein', which means are provided by the European Fund for Regional Development (EFRE) and the Federal State of Switzerland: Project 'IBH Living Lab Active and Assisted Living', grants ABH40 and ABH66.;;34;3;3;0;16;IOP PUBLISHING LTD;BRISTOL;TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND;0967-3334;1361-6579;;PHYSIOL MEAS;Physiol.

Innovations in prevention practice move away from expert-driven approaches to emphasize local control through processes that utilize research evidence, but privilege self- determined action based on local and personal contexts, meanings, and frameworks for action. Promoting Community Conversations About Research to End Suicide is a community health intervention that draws on networks of Indigenous health educators in rural Alaska, who host learning circles in which research evidence is used to spark conversations and empower community members to consider individual and collective action to support vulnerable people and create health-promoting conditions that reduce suicide risk. The first of nine learning circles focuses on narratives of local people who link the contemporary youth suicide epidemic to 20th century American colonialism, and situates prevention within this context. We describe the theoretical framework and feasibility and acceptability outcomes for this learning circle, and elucidate how the educational model engages community members in decolonial approaches to suicide prevention education and practice, thus serving as a bridge between Western and Indigenous traditions to generate collective knowledge and catalyze community healing.;"[Trout, Lucas; Mullany, Anna; White, Lauren; Wexler, Lisa] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Hlth Promot & Policy, Boston, MA 01003 USA; [McEachern, Diane] Univ Alaska, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA";Wexler, L (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Hlth Promot & Policy, Boston, MA 01003 USA.;lwexler@umass.edu;;White, Lauren/0000-0002-2752-9743;"National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes for Health [R34MH096684]; Maniilaq Association Wellness Program";Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes for Health under Award Number R34MH096684.

Design: A consensus committee of 13 experts was convened. A formal conflict-of-interest (COI) policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence. The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Few recommendations were ungraded. Methods: The panel focused on 6 questions: 1) Why must oxygen desaturation be avoided during intubation and what preoxygenation and oxygenation techniques should be used to prevent it? 2) Should videolaryngoscopes be used instead of standard laryngoscopy with or without a long stylet to achieve a better success rate of intubation after the first attempt during anticipated difficult intubation off fiberoptic intubation? 3) Should TCI or target controlled inhalation anaesthesia (TCIA) be used instead of bolus sedation for airway control in the event of suspected or proven difficulty in a patient spontaneously breathing? 4) What mode of anaesthesia should be performed in patients with difficult intubation criteria and potentially difficult mask ventilation? 5) In surgical patients, what criteria predict difficulties encountered during postoperative tracheal extubation? 6) Should decision trees and algorithms be employed to direct decision-making for the management of difficult intubation, whether foreseen or not? (based on the information from the preceding five issues). Population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) questions were reviewed and updated as needed, and evidence profiles were generated. The analysis of the literature and the recommendations were then conducted according to the GRADE (R) methodology. Results: The SFAR Guideline panel provided 13 statements on difficult intubation and extubation in adult anaesthesia. After two rounds of discussion and various amendments, a strong agreement was reached for 99% of recommendations. Of these recommendations, five have a high level of evidence (Grade 1 +/-), 8 have a low level of evidence (Grade 2 +/-). No recommendation was provided for one question. Conclusions: Substantial agreement exists among experts regarding many strong recommendations for the best care of patients with difficult intubation and extubation in adult anaesthesia.

Land suitability analysis is a one of the methods of assessment of detecting inherent capacities, potential and suitability levels of the lands for agriculture, and was utilized with the same land elements in this study. A multi-criterion decision making approach using IRS P6 LISS-IV satellite dataset within a GIS environment was used to identify suitable areas for agriculture in the Darna catchment. Experts' opinions, literature review, and correlation technique were used to decide influencing criteria, assign scores to sub-criteria, and judgment formation in pairwise comparison matrix. All thematic layers of criteria were integrated with each other in GIS using the weighted overlay technique and generated agriculture suitability map into four classes according to FAO. About 23% of the area is under agriculture in the study region. This area can extend up to 69% under agriculture converting fallow land, scrub land, and sparse forest according to soil qualities with suitability levels, i.e., highly suitable (19%), moderately suitable (16%), and marginally suitable (34%). About 31% (19,219ha) of reviewed area are classified in the class permanently not suitable for agriculture. Moderately and marginally suitable land requires the irrigation facility for efficient agriculture. This study emphasizes that about 46% area has potential as agriculture land and it will help improve the financial condition of the farmers.;[Zolekar, Rajendra Bhausaheb] KVN Naik Shikshan Prasarak Sansthas Arts Commerce, Dept Geog, Nasik 422002, Maharashtra, India;Zolekar, RB (corresponding author), KVN Naik Shikshan Prasarak Sansthas Arts Commerce, Dept Geog, Nasik 422002, Maharashtra, India.;raj4mezolekar@gmail.com;Zolekar, Rajendra/AAH-3538-2019;Zolekar, Rajendra/0000-0002-8726-5428;;;;61;4;4;3;13;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1866-7511;1866-7538;;ARAB J GEOSCI;Arab.

To achieve personalized qualitative feedback, we demonstrated a proof-of-concept prototype combining kinesiology and computational intelligence that could help improving tennis swing technique utilizing three-dimensional (3D) tennis motion data acquired from multicamera video. Expert data labeling relied on virtual 3D stick figure replay. Diverse assessment criteria for novice to those with intermediate skill levels and configurable coaching scenarios matched with a variety of tennis swings (22 backhands and 21 forehands), including good technique and common errors. A set of selected coaching rules (CRs) was transferred to adaptive assessment modules able to learn from data, evolve their internal structures, and produce autonomous personalized feedback, including verbal cues over virtual camera 3D replay and an end-of-session progress report. The prototype demonstrated autonomous assessment on future data based on learning from prior examples, aligned with skill level, flexible coaching scenarios, and CRs. The generated intuitive diagnostic feedback consisted of elements of safety and performance for tennis swing technique, where each swing sample was compared with the expert. For safety aspects of the relative swing width, the prototype showed improved assessment (from 81% to 91%) when taking into account occluded parts of the pelvis. This study has shown proof of concept for personalized qualitative feedback. The next generation of augmented coaching and exergaming systems will be able to help improve end user's sport discipline-specific techniques. By learning from small expert-labeled data sets, such systems will be able to adapt and provide personalized intuitive autonomous assessment and diagnostic feedback aligned with a specified coaching program and context requirements.;"[Bacic, Boris] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Engn Comp & Math Sci, AUT Tower,2-14 Wakefield St, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Bacic, Boris; Hume, Patria A.] Auckland Univ Technol, Sport Performance Res Inst New Zealand, Auckland, New Zealand";Bacic, B (corresponding author), Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Engn Comp & Math Sci, AUT Tower,2-14 Wakefield St, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.;boris.bacic@aut.ac.nz;"Hume, Patria Anne/P-1084-2017; Bacic, Boris/M-3952-2019";;AUT;We express appreciation to Prof. Stephen MacDonell for his support, and to Prof. Barry Wilson and Prof. Will Hopkins for helpful feedback before shaping this article.

We propose a new Multiswarm Heterogeneous Binary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (MHBPSO) using a Win-Win approach to improve the performance of Binary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (BPSO) for feature selection. MHBPSO is a cooperation algorithm, which includes BPSO and its three variants such as Boolean PSO (BoPSO), Self Adjusted Hierarchical Boolean PSO (SAHBoPSO), and Catfish Self Adjusted Hierarchical Boolean PSO (CSAHBoPSO). It performs heterogeneous search on the entire solution space using four different algorithms. Each algorithm shares global best information to another algorithm to select the preeminent global best position. A variant of BoPSO, SAHBoPSO is proposed, in which leaders are identified based on the fitness values for guiding remaining particles and thus forms the hierarchical structure of leaders and its followers. Meanwhile leaders and followers are changed dynamically and consequently changed the hierarchical structure. CSAHBoPSO, which is the version of SAHBoPSO, is also proposed to avoid stagnation in the subsequent iterations. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithms CEC 2013 benchmark functions are employed. In order to validate the proposed algorithms, comparative study with BPSO, BoPSO, VPSO (Mirjalili and Lewis, 2013), HBPSOGA (Wang et al., 2018) and CatfishBPSO (Chuang et al., 2011a) is provided. Experimental results show that SAHBoPSO and CSAHBoPSO algorithm based on BoPSO are promising and significantly better than BPSO, BoPSO, and VPSO. MHBPSO shows the superior improvement in the search ability. In addition, proposed algorithms are tested in the feature selection phase of intelligent liver and kidney cancer diagnostic systems to select elite features from the liver and kidney cancer data. Findings show that the proposed system is proficient in selecting the elite features to classify the tumor as benign or malignant with minimum error rates. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

BCS heavily influences milk production, reproduction, and health of cows. Therefore, it is important to monitor BCS to achieve better animal response, but this is a time-consuming and subjective task performed visually by expert scorers. Several studies have tried to automate BCS of dairy cows by applying image analysis and machine learning techniques. This work analyzes these studies and proposes a system based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve overall automatic BCS estimation, whose use might be extended beyond dairy production. The developed system has achieved good estimation results in comparison with other systems in the area. Overall accuracy of BCS estimations within 0.25 units of difference from true values was 78%, while overall accuracy within 0.50 units was 94%. Similarly, weighted precision and recall, which took into account imbalance BCS distribution in the built dataset, show similar values considering those error ranges.;"[Arroqui, Mauricio; Mangudo, Pablo; Toloza, Juan; Jatip, Daniel; Machado, Claudio] ANPCyT, D TEC, Godoy Cruz, Argentina; [Rodriguez, Juan M.; Teyseyre, Alfredo; Zunino, Alejandro; Mateos, Cristian] UNICEN, CONICET, ISSTAN, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rodriguez Alvarez, Juan; Arroqui, Mauricio; Mangudo, Pablo; Toloza, Juan; Jatip, Daniel; Machado, Claudio] UNICEN, CONICET, CIVETAN, CICPBA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Sanz, Carlos] UNICEN, Fac Vet Sci, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina";Alvarez, JR (corresponding author), UNICEN, CONICET, CIVETAN, CICPBA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;jrodriguezalvarez@alumnos.exa.unicen.edu.ar;"Zunino, Alejandro/W-2100-2017; Rodriguez, Juan Manuel/V-9039-2019";"Zunino, Alejandro/0000-0002-9537-3541; Rodriguez, Juan Manuel/0000-0002-1130-8065; Rodriguez Alvarez, Juan/0000-0002-5108-078X";;;;40;22;22;0;17;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;0168-1699;1872-7107;;COMPUT ELECTRON AGR;Comput.

However, the complexity of the AP algorithm increases with the projection order. A wealth of fast AP algorithms have been proposed to reduce the complexity in the last two decades. However, those low-complexity methods have not been well analyzed and compared. To fill this gap, this paper reviews the fast AP algorithms, including both fast filtering approaches and efficient solutions of the linear system of equations. The advantages and disadvantages of each fast implementation version are clarified based on an extensive performance evaluation, which could be useful to engineers when selecting a suitable algorithm for their specific applications and could also be a starting point for experts in this field to develop better solutions.

The Statement offers a detailed introduction to the concept of health literacy, calling for global action to improve health literacy in populations. It positions health literacy as an important and modifiable social determinant of health, that plays a significant role in broadly-based strategies for health promotion. The Statement emphasises the necessity of a systems approach to health literacy, underpinned by global, national, regional and local policies. It summarises key evidence to guide practice and policy development, recognising the importance of continued investment in intervention research, in professional and consumer capacity building, and in the transfer of research findings into frontline health promotion practice.

The main idea behind ADRC is modeling effects of both internal uncertainties and external disturbances as an extra state called the total disturbance which is timely estimated. In the majority of recent works, it is assumed that time derivative of total disturbance is bounded. First we prove that, beside the system characteristics, the validity of this assumption strongly depends on the tuning parameters, even in the case of simple classes of linear second-order systems. Thus, one should be careful upon making this common assumption independent from the tuning parameters. Then, the effect of imperfections imposed by sensor dynamics, measurement noise, actuator saturation, and discrete implementation are thoroughly studied. It is shown that these imperfections could crucially affect the control performance. Furthermore, a tuning method, with a higher degree of freedom, is proposed involving the stability considerations in its design procedure. The given theoretical analyses are supported via both simulation and experimental results. The discussed issues are recommended to be carefully considered by experts and practitioners of ADRC.;"[Ahi, Behzad; Haeri, Mohammad] Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Tehran 1136511155, Iran";Haeri, M (corresponding author), Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Tehran 1136511155, Iran.;"ahi@ee.sharif.edu; haeri@sharif.ir";Haeri, Mohammad/Q-1391-2015;Haeri, Mohammad/0000-0001-8509-4525;Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) [96015503];This work was supported by the Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) under Grant 96015503.;;32;19;19;6;45;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;1083-4435;1941-014X;;IEEE-ASME T MECH;IEEE-ASME Trans.

The main difficulty lies in the bidding phase of bridge, which requires cooperative decision making with partial information. Existing artificial intelligence systems for bridge bidding rely on, and are thus restricted by, human-designed bidding systems or features. In this work, we propose a flexible and pioneering bridge-bidding system, which can learn either with or without the aid of human domain knowledge. The system is based on a novel deep reinforcement learning model, which extracts sophisticated features and learns to bid automatically based on raw card data. The model includes an upper-confidence-bound algorithm and additional techniques to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. We further study how different pieces of human knowledge can be exploited to assist the model. Our experiments demonstrate the promising performance of our proposed model. In particular, the model can advance fromhaving no knowledge on bidding to achieving a superior performance compared with a champion-winning computer bridge program that implements a human-designed bidding system. In addition, further synergies can be extracted by incorporating expert knowledge into the proposed model.;"[Yeh, Chih-Kuan] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Machine Learning, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Hsieh, Cheng-Yu; Lin, Hsuan-Tien] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan";Lin, HT (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.;"b01901163@ntu.edu.tw; b01705033@ntu.edu.tw; htlin@csie.ntu.edu.tw";Lin, Hsuan-Tien/AAE-4359-2020;Lin, Hsuan-Tien/0000-0003-2968-0671;"Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Asian Office of Aerospace Research and Development (AOARD)United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) [FA2386-15-1-4012]; Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 103-2221-E-002-148-MY3, GrantMOST106-2119-M-007-027]";This work was supported in part by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Asian Office of Aerospace Research and Development (AOARD) under Award FA2386-15-1-4012, and in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under Grant MOST 103-2221-E-002-148-MY3 and GrantMOST106-2119-M-007-027.;;25;0;0;0;7;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2475-1502;2475-1510;;IEEE T GAMES;IEEE Trans.

Aim This study aimed to identify and prioritize topics related to the development of evidence-based geriatric nursing practice guidelines in long-term care facilities in Korea. Methods To identify potential topics, 89 nurses responded to a questionnaire on activities that require further evidence and/or standardization in the long-term care facility setting. To prioritize these topics, 14 geriatric nursing experts completed surveys to prioritize five categories. Results The collected data included 240 clinical topics, which were classified into 41 subcategories and 18 main categories. According to topic prioritization by the geriatric nursing experts, the following were the most heavily weighted categories: fall prevention, position change and prevention of pressure ulcers. Conclusions The development of standardized guidelines based on these results may help improve the quality of geriatric care and quality of life of older individuals. The small number of respondents may be a limitation of this study, and further study is needed to expand the population. Implications for nursing and health policy The development of evidence-based nursing guidelines based on the present findings will help improve the quality of nursing in long-term care facilities. Additionally, health policies and systems, such as introduction of a fee for nursing services for older individuals based on the evidence, are worth considering.;"[Kim, S.] Changwon Natl Univ, Dept Nursing, Chang Won, South Korea; [Kim, K.] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Nursing, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea; [Kim, S.

These techniques aim to elaborate on radargrams in order to produce meaningful graphical representations of critical buried components of WSSs. These representations are helpful non-destructive evaluation tools to prevent possible failures in WSSs by keeping them adequately monitored. This paper proposes an integrated multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach to prioritize various data processing techniques by means of ranking their outputs, namely their resulting GPR image representations. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is applied to weight various evaluation criteria, with the purpose of managing vagueness and uncertainty characterizing experts' judgments. Then, the Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalite III (ELECTRE III) method is used to obtain the final ranking of alternatives. A real case study, focusing on a set of four GPR images as outputs of different data processing techniques, is presented to prove the usefulness of the proposed hybrid approach. In particular, the GPR images are ranked according the evaluation of five criteria namely visualization, interpretation, identification of features, extraction of information and affordability. The findings offer a structured support in selecting the most suitable data processing technique(s) to explore WSS underground. In the presented case, two options, namely the variance filter and the subtraction methods, offer the best results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

First, based on the information of expert knowledge and the experience of field workers, a fuzzy qualitative model is constructed, and outputs of the qualitative model are reasonably divided into multiple modes simultaneously. By analyzing the process properties, an optimal control problem for hydrometallurgy plant-wide production process in the steady state is proposed to achieve process requirements which is to obtain the lowest cost of sodium cyanide and zinc as well as high gold quality. Then, by using interval numbers to represent the key variables that cannot be measured, an optimization method based on interval numbers is proposed for every output mode of the qualitative model. Finally, the hydrometallurgy process is carried in industrial simulation experiment. The results demonstrate that the proposed optimization scheme has much wider applicability than conventional optimization methods, especially for its improved performance of solving optimization problem with uncertainty.;"[Liu, Yadong; Chang, Yuqing; Niu, Dapeng; Wang, Fuli] Northeastern Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Chang, Yuqing; Niu, Dapeng; Wang, Fuli] State Key Lab Integrated Automat Proc Ind, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China";Liu, YD (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China.;lyd1204lyd@163.com;;Liu, Yadong/0000-0002-8610-6863;"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [N150404017]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61304121, 61533007, 61673092]";"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: N150404017; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 61304121, 61533007 and 61673092";;39;1;1;0;5;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0886-9383;1099-128X;;J CHEMOMETR;J.

The resulting GAG accumulation in cells and connective tissues ultimately results in widespread tissue and organ dysfunction. The seven MPS types currently described are heterogeneous and progressive disorders, with somatic and neurological manifestations depending on the type of accumulating GAG. Heparan sulfate (HS) is one of the GAGs stored in patients with MPS I, II, and VII and the main GAG stored in patients with MPS III. These disorders are associated with significant central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities that can manifest as impaired cognition, hyperactive and/or aggressive behavior, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, and sleeping problems. This review discusses the anatomical and pathophysiological CNS changes accompanying HS accumulation as well as the mechanisms believed to cause CNS abnormalities in MPS patients. The content of this review is based on presentations and discussions on these topics during a meeting on the brain in MPS attended by an international group of MPS experts.;"[Bigger, Brian W.] Univ Manchester, Fac Med & Human Sci, Stem Cell & Neurotherapies Lab, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Begley, David J.] Kings Coll London, Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Drug Delivery Grp, London, England; [Virgintino, Daniela] Bari Univ, Sch Med, Human Anat & Histol Unit, Dept Basic Med Sci Neurosci & Sensory Organs, Bari, Italy; [Pshezhetsky, Alexey V.] Univ Montreal, CHU St Justine, Res Ctr, Dept Pediat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Pshezhetsky, Alexey V.] Univ Montreal, CHU St Justine, Res Ctr, Dept Biochem, Montreal, PQ, Canada";Bigger, BW (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Div Cell Matrix & Regenerat Med, 3-721 Stopford Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England.;brian.bigger@manchester.ac.uk;;VIRGINTINO, Daniela/0000-0003-1041-5341;BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.;This work was supported by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.;;123;31;32;1;7;ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE;SAN DIEGO;525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA;1096-7192;1096-7206;;MOL GENET METAB;Mol.

Recently, community-led causal loop diagrams have been developed to support community-based obesity prevention interventions. This paper presents a quantitative comparison between the Foresight obesity systems map and a community-developed map of the drivers of obesity. Methods Variables from a community-developed map were coded against the thematic clusters defined in the Foresight map to allow comparison of their sizes and strength of adjoining causal relationships. Central variables were identified using techniques from network analysis. These properties were compared to understand the similarities and differences between the systems as defined by the two groups. Results The community map focused on environmental influences, such as built physical activity environment (18% of variables) and social psychology (38%). The Foresight map's largest cluster was physiology (23%), a minimal focus in the community map (2%). Network analysis highlighted media and available time within both maps, but variables related to school and sporting club environments were unique to the community map. Conclusion Community stakeholders focus on modifiable social and environmental drivers of obesity. Capturing local perspectives is critical when using systems maps to guide community-based obesity prevention.;"[McGlashan, J.; Hayward, J.; Brown, A.; Owen, B.; Allender, S.] Deakin Univ, Sch Hlth & Social Dev, Global Obes Ctr GLOBE, 1 Gheringhap St, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia; [McGlashan, J.; Johnstone, M.; Creighton, D.] Deakin Univ, Inst Intelligent Syst Res & Innovat, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Millar, L.] Victoria Univ, Australian Hlth Policy Collaborat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Millar, L.] Univ Melbourne & Western Hlth, Australian Inst Musculoskeletal Sci AIMSS, St Albans, Vic, Australia";McGlashan, J (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Sch Hlth & Social Dev, Global Obes Ctr GLOBE, 1 Gheringhap St, Geelong, Vic 3220, Australia.;mcglashan@deakin.edu.au;"Brown, Andrew/W-4026-2019; Millar, Lynne/AAS-4907-2020; Millar, Lynne/AAD-5983-2019; Allender, Steven/G-9881-2011";"Brown, Andrew/0000-0002-6385-3225; ";"NHMRC Partnership ProjectNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP1114118]; Western Alliance; Australian National Health and Medical Research Council/Australian National Heart Foundation Career Development FellowshipNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia; Australian Government Research Training Program ScholarshipAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science";This study is supported by an NHMRC Partnership Project titled 'Whole of Systems Trial of Prevention Strategies for childhood obesity: WHO STOPS childhood obesity' (APP1114118).

In the domain of object recognition, it has been suggested that expert processing is characterized by the use of different mechanisms from the ones involved in general object recognition. It has been suggested that one traditional marker of expert processing is the inversion effect. To investigate whether face and word recognition differ from general object recognition, we compared the effect of inversion on the perceptual efficiency of face and visual word recognition as well as on the recognition of a third, non-expert object category, houses. From the comparison of identification contrast thresholds to an ideal observer, we derived the efficiency and equivalent input noise of stimulus processing in both upright and inverted orientations. While efficiency reflects the efficacy in sampling the available information, equivalent input noise is associated with the degradation of the stimulus signal within the visual system. We hypothesized that large inversion effects for efficiency and/or equivalent input noise should characterize expert high-level processes, and asked whether this would be true for both faces and words, but not houses. However, we found that while face recognition efficiency was profoundly reduced by inversion, the efficiency of word and house recognition was minimally influenced by the orientation manipulation. Inversion did not affect equivalent input noise. These results suggest that even though faces and words are both considered expert processes, only the efficiency of the mechanism involved in face recognition is sensitive to orientation.;"[Albonico, Andrea; Furubacke, Amanda; Barton, Jason J.

At present, there is no well-structured and organised system for documenting the popular crop varieties and their area coverage in India. The present study attempts to fill such knowledge gaps by documenting the major maize varieties and estimating the adoption rates under the same, using the expert elicitation methodology. The study finds that maize cultivation in the traditional growing states and tribal belts is mainly dominated by the cultivation of local varieties and composites with a low seed replacement rate, especially during kharif season. Most widely cultivated maize varieties in India were P-3501, NK-6240, P-3396 and N-K30. Among the public sector varieties JM-216, JVM-421, African Tall, Narmada Moti and GM-6 were widely cultivated. The private sector maize varieties are dominating in those states where maize is mainly cultivated for commercial purpose such as feed and other industries. General resistance to diseases, lodging tolerance, grain colour, high shelling recovery and good storage life are some of the preferred attributes of the popular varieties. Several promising varieties from the public sector have not reached the farmers' fields due to non-availability of seed. On the other hand, private sector maize hybrids have successfully diffused to farmers' fields owning to strong marketing initiatives. Public sector varieties need to be brought under an efficient seed production system along with an effective transfer of hybrid maize cultivation technology to boost the maize yield levels and production in India.;"[Pavithra, S.; Shah, Showkat Ahmad; Subash, S.

As thermal power plants were a major part of the supply capacity after the disaster, especially under peak load conditions, consumers located both within and outside the severely damaged area had to reduce power usage to meet power consumption targets and avoid major blackouts. Therefore, experts and decision makers should use the records available from such accidents to determine appropriate margins of supply capacity and demand constraint policy during a crisis. Here, we constructed a probability model describing the likelihood of accident occurrence for thermal power plants based on the actual accident and recovery data obtained after the Great East Japan Earthquake. The lognormal and Weibull hazard models fit the observed data well, where the accidents tended to occur for many times at the same power generation unit under heavy-duty conditions. We then applied the developed probability model to Japanese thermal power plants in a bootstrap framework to understand the potential risk of power shortages during such events and to derive policy implications.;"[Yuyama, Ayumi] Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Tokyo, Japan; [Kajitani, Yoshio] Kagawa Univ, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan; [Shoji, Gaku] Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan";Kajitani, Y (corresponding author), Kagawa Univ, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.;kajitani@eng.kagawa-u.ac.jp;KAJITANI, YOSHIO/W-2338-2019;Kajitani, Yoshio/0000-0003-3110-7436;Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [16k12390];This research is supported by Grant-in-Aid for scientific research (C) (grant number: 16k12390) from The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.;;33;3;3;0;8;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;0306-2619;1872-9118;;APPL ENERG;Appl.

This research proposed a new solution for solving the scalability issues faced by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique, namely removing eigenvalues and introducing the dynamic consistency checking algorithm into AHP (ReDCCahp). This aims to reduce the required number of pairwise comparisons, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of AHP. An empirical investigation was performed to evaluate the proposed solution, comparing ReDCCahp with the AHP. This comparison aims to show which of the two techniques is more scalable, more efficient, understandable, easier to use, less time consuming, needs less effort, and preferred by the participants in practice. A controlled experiment was carried out on a group of 84 participants who were asked to prioritize 42 requirements related to the online flea market system, using the two techniques in various orders. The experiment's findings reveal that the participants using ReDCCahp had better ability to prioritize more software requirements (more scalable) with lower effort, shorter time, lower complexity, and higher understandability than using AHP. Furthermore, the participants preferred using ReDCCahp over AHP. The overall results confirm that using ReDCCahp is more effective and helpful than AHP and has the ability to solve the problems faced by AHP in prioritizing software requirements. Therefore, ReDCCahp is suitable to be implemented in real environments. This will contribute in helping software companies and related experts to enhance the quality of the proposed software.;"[Ibriwesh, Iyas; Ho, Sin-Ban; Chai, Ian] Multimedia Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Cyberjaya 63100, Malaysia";Ibriwesh, I (corresponding author), Multimedia Univ, Fac Comp & Informat, Cyberjaya 63100, Malaysia.;"ibrawish2012@gmail.com; sbho@mmu.edu.my; ianchai@mmu.edu.my";Ho, Sin Ban/A-3019-2010;Ho, Sin Ban/0000-0003-2995-2120;;;;52;2;2;0;2;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;2193-567X;2191-4281;;ARAB J SCI ENG;Arab.

However, the recent research suggests there is a decline in the number of text book readers. Since recommender systems help in providing items of users' need, good and precise recommendation of the books could enhance the users' affinity toward reading the books. The primary objective of this paper is to present an opinion mining-based recommendation technique which can provide the university students with the promising books for their syllabus. The problem with the existing recommender technique is that these methods take only expert recommendation in consideration and the involvement of the opinion of the users, i.e., students/readers, has not been considered which allow us to understand how the readers perceive the recommended books and whether they are satisfied with the recommendation or not? To address the issue, we consider experts and readers both by employing experts' recommendation for books at top-ranked universities and exploring users' reviews on the concerned book at online retailers' sites such as Amazon. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms, eight different parameters have been used; up to 55% improvement in the result has been obtained through proposed method.

While many research works have addressed various aspects of VR-based 4D simulation, there is still no comprehensive and neutral framework to help both practitioners and experts to identify the main challenges to address. This paper proposes four main complementary steps with which to define the VR environment, to develop the 4D model, to prepare and transfer the model in the VR system and to conduct constructability analysis meeting. In the current state of the framework, the 4D-based constructability analysis is more about the collaborative use of 4D rather than the collaborative generation and interaction with the 4D model. Each step of the framework is supported by appropriate methods and tools. A collaborative personas-based case study helps to evaluate the framework and to show how it can be used. Compared to recent related works, the proposed framework is more structured and comprehensive, providing a structured approach using concepts from multiple scientific areas.;[Boton, Conrad] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Construct Engn, 1100 Rue Notre Dame Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada;Boton, C (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Dept Construct Engn, 1100 Rue Notre Dame Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.;conrad.boton@etsmtl.ca;;Boton, Conrad/0000-0002-1843-6748;;;;77;20;22;6;41;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0926-5805;1872-7891;;AUTOMAT CONSTR;Autom.

This lack of insight, often leads to designs that compromise the social and environmental aspects of designs in order to reduce the initial construction costs of infrastructure awns. In addition to the lack of insight, currently available methods for analyzing alternative infrastructure configurations with respect to decision maker preferences: require analysis on a case-by-case (e.g., pairwise) basis; are not appropriate for the initial design phase (e.g., are time-consuming); and are not adaptable to a range of alternative design solutions (e.g., adding and removing alternatives might require a re-ranking from the decision maker). This paper presents a modular preference function development strategy that aims to address these issues, termed Sustainable Infrastructure Multi-Criteria Preference assessment of aLtematives for Early Design (SIMPLE-Design). The proposed strategy develops utility functions (indifference curves) for assessing decision maker preferences with regard to various tradeoffs of alternative design options, and leverages available data to provide decision makers with a consistent frame of reference for assessing alternatives. An illustration presented for a decision support tool using the Simple-Design strategy assesses decision maker preferences for commercial buildings with respect to initial construction costs, building damage and business interruption costs, casualty costs (due to the occurrence of natural hazard events), and CO2 emission costs. The designed decision support tool provides streamlined information to support preference assessment with reasonably low cognitive load. Ten out of the twelve decision support tool users stated that allowing the decision makers to define alternatives of equal utility (value) in a systematic manner, and providing information on the various cost types (decision criteria), are the most essential elements of the assessment strategy. The presented modular preference assessment framework, as well as the decision support tool itself, are generalizable and can be adapted to other infrastructure types. The contribution to the body of knowledge is a holistic preference assessment framework that allows decision makers to make more informed decisions and designers to better incorporate the preferences of the decision makers during the early design process.";"[Shahtaheri, Yasaman; Flint, Madeleine M.; de la Garza, Jesus M.] Virginia Tech, Charles E Via Jr Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA";Shahtaheri, Y (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Charles E Via Jr Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Patton Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.;"yassh@vt.edu; mflint@vt.edu; chema@vt.edu";Shahtaheri, Yasaman/AAP-9568-2020;"Shahtaheri, Yasaman/0000-0002-4332-4182; Flint, Madeleine/0000-0002-1820-6694";"US National Science Foundation, Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing InnovationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1455466]; Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact InnNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [1455466] Funding Source: National Science Foundation";This research is supported by the US National Science Foundation, Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation, through Award #1455466.

Supplementing insufficient data by the reproduction of appropriate values can mitigate the potential negative effects on the solutions resulting from sudden changes. However, CBR researchers have rarely examined this issue. To address this challenge, this research proposes a learning method for knowledge retention based on CBR by applying a data-mining approach to manage missing dataset values. A case study on a 164-apartment project was conducted to compare the estimation accuracy of the suggested learning method to that of past research with the same experiment conditions. The learning method with the CBR model achieved higher accuracy of the overall cost estimation and higher stability compared with the previous model. This research shows how cases can be generated and retained as learned cases to overcome the difficulties of continuous updates in a wide range of construction projects, as well as why the case bases need to be continuously updated. The research outcomes could support work related to cost estimation for decision makers ranging from beginners to experts in both academia and industry.;"[Ji, Sae-Hyun] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Construct & Environm Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Ahn, Joseph] Hoseo Univ, Div Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Asan 31499, South Korea; [Lee, Eul-Bum; Kim, Yonggu] POSTECH, Grad Inst Ferrous Technol, Pohang 37673, South Korea";Ahn, J (corresponding author), Hoseo Univ, Div Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Asan 31499, South Korea.;"oldclock@snu.ac.kr; josephahn@hoseo.edu; dreblee@postech.ac.kr; ch61park@postech.ac.kr";;"Kim, Yonggu/0000-0002-4266-2278; LEE, EUL-BUM/0000-0001-8885-1798";"Institute of Construction and Environmental Engineering at Seoul National University; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [2017R1A2B2007050]";This research was supported by Institute of Construction and Environmental Engineering at Seoul National University and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by Korea government (MSIT) (2017R1A2B2007050).

Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) methods integrated into AHUs can help to ensure that they comply with the intended design, and their efficiency is maintained throughout the entire operational stage of the building. Nonetheless, the implementation and deployment of FDDs at the operational stage require an extensive effort. Especially, FDD approaches that rely on first principle models (model-based FDD) need to be manually implemented, and the information necessary for this process is scattered between several exchange formats and files, thus making it time-consuming, error-prone and subject to modellers' poor judgment. This study aims at facilitating and partially automating the implementation and deployment of model-based FDD. An automated tool-chain that combines a BIM (Building Information Model)-to-BEPS (Building Energy Performance Simulation) tool with a model-based FDD approach is developed. The contribution of this paper lies in the extension of an existing BIM to Modelica BEPS method with an automated calibration approach and a novel model-based FDD. These three elements are integrated in a framework (implemented using Python) to reduce experts' involvement in FDD implementation and deployment. The developed model-based FDD combines a parity relation procedure for fault detection and profile identification for fault diagnosis. The latter uses the robust multi-objective optimisation algorithm NSGA-2. An error is detected when the difference between prediction and measured data over a specific time window is superior to a predefined threshold. The origin of the error is subsequently identified by estimating the profile of the different controllable components' control signal. The developed tool-chain was applied to an actual AHU as well as on several numerical scenarios to identify typical AHU faults such as faulty dampers, valves and sensors. This study shows that the developed model-based FDD approach can identify some of the most common faults in AHUs, but more importantly that BIM can facilitate the deployment of model-based FDD in building systems.;"[Andriamamonjy, Ando; Saelens, Dirk] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Civil Engn, Bldg Phys Sect, Kasteelpk Arenberg 40,Box 2447, BE-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Andriamamonjy, Ando; Klein, Ralf] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Technol Cluster Construct, Technol Campus Ghent,Gebroeders Smetstr 1, BE-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Saelens, Dirk] EnergyVille, Thor Pk 8310, BE-3600 Genk, Belgium";Andriamamonjy, A (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Civil Engn, Bldg Phys Sect, Kasteelpk Arenberg 40,Box 2447, BE-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.;ando.andriamamonjy@kuleuven.be;Saelens, Dirk/AAA-6463-2020;Saelens, Dirk/0000-0003-3450-5448;"KU LeuvenKU Leuven; European UnionEuropean Union (EU); European Regional Development Fund ERDFEuropean Union (EU); Province of Limburg; Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship";This project received funding from KU Leuven, the European Union, the European Regional Development Fund ERDF, Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship and the Province of Limburg.;;66;9;9;5;28;ELSEVIER;AMSTERDAM;RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0926-5805;1872-7891;;AUTOMAT CONSTR;Autom.

UC challenged the Board's determination there was no interference-in-fact between UC's Application No. 13/842,859, and the claims of 12 patents and one application owned by the Broad Institute. The Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's decision, which was based on its finding that UC's claims, reciting method of cleaving a nucleic acid using a CRISPR-Cas9 system, would not have rendered obvious Broad's invention of the use of CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotes. CRISPR-Cas9 systems occur naturally in prokaryotes such as bacteria, but have not been found to naturally exist in eukaryotes, such as plants and animals. The Board credited the testimony of experts hired by both parties, and statements made by the UC inventors themselves, in reaching its conclusion that at the time of Broad's invention one of skill in the art would not have predicted a reasonable likelihood of success in using CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotes. Assuming this decision stands, it would appear that both UC and Broad will be able to move forward with their respective, and likely overlapping, patents on the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology.;[Holman, Christopher M.] Univ Missouri, Kansas City Sch Law, Columbia, MO 65211 USA;Holman, CM (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Kansas City Sch Law, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.;;;;;;;0;0;0;0;2;MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC;NEW ROCHELLE;140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA;0730-031X;1557-8704;;BIOTECHNOL LAW REP;Biotechnol.

Research has focused on improving access to palliative care by engaging the GP with specialist secondary services in integrated palliative care. Objectives (1) Evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed to engage GPs and specialist secondary services in integrated palliative care; and (2) identify the personal, system and structural barriers and facilitators to integrated palliative care. Method MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL were searched. Any study of a service that engaged the GP with specialist secondary services in the provision of palliative care was included. GP engagement was defined as any organised cooperation between the GP and specialist secondary services in the care of the patient including shared consultations, case conferences that involved at least both the GP and the specialist clinician and/or other secondary services, and/or any formal shared care arrangements between the GP and specialist services. The specialist secondary service is either a specialist palliative service or a service providing specialist care to a palliative population. A narrative framework was used to describe the findings. Results 17 studies were included. There is some evidence that integrated palliative care can reduce hospitalisations and maintain functional status. There are substantial barriers to providing integrated care. Principles and facilitators of the provision of integrated palliative care are discussed. Conclusions This is an emerging field and further research is required assessing the effectiveness of different models of integrated palliative care.";"[Carmont, Sue-Ann; Mitchell, Geoffrey; Senior, Hugh; Foster, Michele] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Senior, Hugh] Massey Univ, Auckland, New Zealand; [Foster, Michele] Griffith Univ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia";Carmont, SA (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Med, Lvl 8,Hlth Sci Bldg, Herston, Qld 4006, Australia.;s.carmont@uq.edu.au;Carmont, Sue-Ann S/G-4769-2011;"Carmont, Sue-Ann S/0000-0001-6266-7757; Senior, Hugh/0000-0002-7081-2499";"Centre for Research Excellence Quality and Safety in Integrated Primary/Secondary Care; Ipswich Hospital Foundation";The authors thank Lars Erikson for assistance with verifying the search strategy.

In this study, a subset of participants, many of whom did not substantially improve while on DM/Q, were re-evaluated using computer-based speech analyses and expert clinician ratings of the overall severity of speech impairment. Speech samples were recorded from the subset of 10 patients at four visits made at approximately 30-day intervals. The recordings were analysed by automated computer-based analysis of speech pausing patterns. Severity of speech impairment was rated by three experienced speech-language pathologists using direct magnitude estimation. Scores on patient-reported and clinician-administered scales of bulbar motor involvement were obtained at each visit. Results Conclusions The effects of DM/Q were detected on several of the objective speech measures, including total pause duration (s) (Cohen's d = 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.70, 0.24), pause time (%) (d = 0.77, 95% CI -1.75, 0.21), and mean speech event duration (s) (d = 0.52, 95% CI -0.44, 1.47), but not on clinician ratings of speech or the speech components of the self-report or clinician-administered scales. These findings suggest that even patients with modest improvement while on DM/Q may experience quantifiable improvements in speech when assessed using sensitive and objective measures. This study provides additional evidence of the positive impact of DM/Q on one or more of the neural systems that control bulbar motor function and production of speech.;"[Green, Jordan R.; Allison, Kristen M.; Cordella, Claire; Richburg, Brian D.] MGH Inst Hlth Profess, Speech & Feeding Disorders Lab, Charlestown, MA USA; [Green, Jordan R.; Cordella, Claire] Harvard Univ, Div Med Sci, Program Speech & Hearing Biosci & Technol Program, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Pattee, Gary L.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Neurol, Med Coll, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Pioro, Erik P.] Cleveland Clin, Neuromuscular Ctr, Dept Neurol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Berry, James D.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Macklin, Eric A.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Biostat Ctr, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Macklin, Eric A.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Med, Boston, MA USA; [Allison, Kristen M.] Northeastern Univ, Bouve Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Smith, Richard A.] Ctr Neurol Study, La Jolla, CA USA";Green, JR (corresponding author), MGH Inst Hlth Profess, 79-96 13th St, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA.;jgreen2@mghihp.edu;Pioro, Erik P/AAZ-5318-2020;Pioro, Erik P/0000-0002-0737-6065;"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01DC013547, R01DC017291, K24 DC01631]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R01DC013547, R01DC017291, K24DC016312, R01DC017291, K24DC016312, R01DC017291, R01DC013547, K24DC016312, R01DC013547] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";This research was supported by NIH grants R01DC013547, R01DC017291, and K24 DC01631.;;38;7;7;0;2;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0306-5251;1365-2125;;BRIT J CLIN PHARMACO;Br.

However, the epidemiology of personality disorders is insufficiently described and surveys report very heterogeneous rates. Aims We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis on the prevalence of personality disorders in adult populations and examine potential moderators that affect heterogeneity. Method We searched PsycINFO, PSYNDEX and Medline for studies that used standardised diagnostics (DSM-IV/-5, ICD-10) to report prevalence rates of personality disorders in community populations in Western countries. Prevalence rates were extracted and aggregated by random-effects models. Meta-regression and sensitivity analyses were performed and publication bias was assessed. Results The final sample comprised ten studies, with a total of 113 998 individuals. Prevalence rates were fairly high for any personality disorder (12.16%; 95% CI, 8.01-17.02%) and similarly high for DSM Clusters A, B and C, between 5.53 (95% CI, 3.20-8.43%) and 7.23% (95% CI, 2.37-14.42%). Prevalence was highest for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (4.32%; 95% CI, 2.16-7.16%) and lowest for dependent personality disorder (0.78%; 95% CI, 0.37-1.32%). A low prevalence was significantly associated with expert-rated assessment (versus self-rated) and reporting of descriptive statistics for antisocial personality disorder. Conclusions Epidemiological studies on personality disorders in community samples are rare, whereas prevalence rates are fairly high and vary substantially depending on samples and methods. Future studies investigating the epidemiology of personality disorders based on the DSM-5 and ICD-11 and models of personality functioning and traits are needed, and efficient treatment should be a priority for healthcare systems to reduce disease burden.";"[Volkert, Jana; Gablonski, Thorsten-Christian] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Psychosocial Prevent, Bergheimer Str 54, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Gablonski, Thorsten-Christian; Rabung, Sven] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Inst Psychol, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Gablonski, Thorsten-Christian] Witten Herdecke Univ, Dept Psychol & Psychotherapy, Witten, Germany";Volkert, J (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, Dept Psychosocial Prevent, Bergheimer Str 54, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.;jana.volkert@med.uni-heidelberg.de;"Volkert, Jana/ABE-3460-2020; Gablonski, Thorsten-Christian/AAM-2740-2020";"Gablonski, Thorsten-Christian/0000-0001-9742-9476; Rabung, Sven/0000-0001-5883-3070; Volkert, Jana/0000-0003-1555-2599";;;;40;37;37;0;22;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND;0007-1250;1472-1465;;BRIT J PSYCHIAT;Br.

However, a method to assess and improve their contributions to achieve the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has not been developed. This research aims to fill this gap. At the time of this research, most certified green buildings in Jordan were under Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) v2.2 new construction. The relationships between the LEED v2.2 water efficiency (WE) and energy and atmosphere (EA) standards and the UN SDGs were explored using a quantitative descriptive methodology. Structured questionnaire surveys yielded 55 responses from Jordanian building industry experts. Pearson's Chi-square and frequency tests were carried out to examine these relationships. We propose a new Comprehensive Contribution to Development Index (CCDI) to assess the contributions of the implementation of LEED v2.2 WE and EA to achieve the UN SDGs. The results show a positive relationship between LEED v2.2 prerequisites and credits in both WE and EA categories with the UN SDGs 6-9, 12-13, and 15, suggesting that the proposed CCDI is a reliable and robust tool for the evaluation of the contribution of water and energy efficiency in LEED v2.2- certified green buildings to achieving the UN SDGs in Jordan.;"[Alawneh, Rami; Ghazali, Farid E.

The presence of a CIED had been regarded as a contraindication to CMR due to concerns of arrhythmias, significant changes to lead parameters, and detrimental changes to device programming. The risk of these potential adverse events is theoretically higher in patients undergoing CMR as compared with other anatomic sites. Recent studies have observed low rates of adverse events in patients undergoing CMR (< 1% to 2%), prompting a shift in the recommendations on CMR in patients with CIEDs. The 2017 Heart Rhythm Society Expert Consensus Statement now states that CMR can be performed in patients with both conditional and nonconditional CIEDs at a magnetic strength of 1.5 T, provided there are no fractured, abandoned, or epicardial leads and modifications to MRI parameters are made. The purpose of this review is to (a) outline the potential concerns of performing CMR in patients with CIEDs, (b) define categories of CIEDs as they pertain to MRI safety, (c) summarize the emerging data on adverse events, and (d) provide a practical approach, integrating the key modifications required to perform CMR in patients with CIEDs.;"[Blissett, Sarah; Chetrit, Michael; Mardigyan, Vartan; Afilalo, Jonathan] McGill Univ, Jewish Gen Hosp, Div Cardiol, Azrieli Heart Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Blissett, Sarah] Western Univ, Div Cardiol, London, ON, Canada; [Kovacina, Bojan] McGill Univ, Jewish Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Afilalo, Jonathan] Jewish Gen Hosp, Lady Davis Inst, Ctr Clin Epidemiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada";Blissett, S (corresponding author), Jewish Gen Hosp, Div Cardiol, 3755 Cote Ste Catherine Rd,Suite A-132, Montreal, PQ H3T 1E2, Canada.;Sarah.blissett@gmail.com;;Chetrit, Michael/0000-0002-8552-4967;Western University Resident Research Career Development Program;Sarah Blissett is grateful to have received support from the Western University Resident Research Career Development Program.;;5;2;2;2;6;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA;0828-282X;1916-7075;;CAN J CARDIOL;Can.

Furthermore, the recent introduction of the first TNM staging system, that is scheduled to replace the Masaoka-Koga system, may create further difficulties in TET management, that remains challenging. Several guidelines for treatment of TETs are available and provide recommendations based mainly on non randomized trials and retrospective or limited series. Often the lack of evidence leads to formulation of indications based on expert opinions. As for other rare cancers it is crucial to create networks to coordinate the work among centres involved in treatment of these diseases in order to offer the best diagnostic and therapeutic tools. For this purpose, in 2014 a network named TYME (ThYmic MalignanciEs), was founded in Italy with the aim of improving care and research in TETs. In September 2017 a panel of multidisciplinary experts from TYME network and from other Italian centres strongly involved in TET diagnosis and treatment convened a first Italian Expert meeting together with representatives of association for patients affected by rare thoracic cancers Tu.To.R, to explore how these tumors are managed in the different centres of Italy compared to ESMO guidelines. In this paper we summarize the issues discussed during that meeting and we propose recommandations based on Masaoka Koga and the new TNM staging system.;"[Imbimbo, Martina; Vitali, Milena; Garassino, Marina Chiara] Fdn IRCCS Ist Nazl Tumori, Unit Thorac Oncol, Milan, Italy; [Ottaviano, Margaret; Palmieri, Giovannella] Univ Federico II, Dept Clin Med & Surg, Rare Tumors Reference Ctr, Naples, Italy; [Fabbri, Alessandra; Pruneri, Giancarlo] Fdn IRCCS Ist Nazl Turnori, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Milan, Italy; [Leuzzi, Giovanni; Pastorino, Ugo] Fdn IRCCS Ist Nazl Turnori, Thorac Surg Unit, Milan, Italy; [Fiore, Michele; Ramella, Sara] Campus Biomed Roma, Radiat Oncol, Rome, Italy; [Franceschini, Davide; Scorsetti, Marta] Humanitas Clin & Res Hosp, Radiotherapy & Radiosurg Dept, Milan, Italy; [Pasello, Giulia] Ist Oncol Veneto IRCCS, Med Oncol 2, Padua, Italy; [Perrino, Matteo; Zucali, Paolo Andrea] Humanitas Clin & Res Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Milan, Italy; [Schiavon, Marco; Rea, Federico] Univ Padua, Dept Cardiothorac & Vasc Sci, Thorac Surg Unit, Padua, Italy; [Tos, Angelo Paolo Dei] Univ Padua, Sch Med, Dept Med, Padua, Italy; [Sangalli, Claudia] Fdn IRCCS Ist Nazl Tumori, Dept Radiol & Radiotherapy, Milan, Italy; [Berardi, Rossana] Univ Politecn Marche, Osped Riuniti Ancona, Clin Oncol, Ancona, Italy; [Alessi, Alessandra] Fdn IRCCS Ist Nazl Tumori, Dept Nucl Med, Milan, Italy; [Calareso, Giuseppina] Fdn IRCCS Ist Nazl Tumori, Dept Radiol, Milan, Italy; [Petrini, Iacopo] Univ Pisa, Gen Pathol, Dept Translat Res & New Technol Med, Pisa, Italy; [Scorsetti, Marta] Humanitas Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Milan, Italy; [Scotti, Vieri] Careggi Univ Hosp, Radiat Oncol Unit, Dept Oncol, Florence, Italy; [Rosso, Lorenzo] Univ Milan, Fdn IRCCS Ca Granda Osped Maggiore Policlin, Thorac Surg & Lung Transplantat Unit, Milan, Italy; [Casali, Paolo Giovanni] Fdn IRCCS Ist Nazl Tumori, Adult Mesenchymal Tumor Med Oncol Unit, Milan, Italy; [Ricardi, Umberto] Univ Turin, Turin, Italy; [Abate-Daga, Laura] Assoc TU TO R Tumori Toracici Rari, Milan, Italy; [Torri, Valter] IRCCS Mario Negri Inst Pharmacol Res, Lab Methodol Biomed Res, Milan, Italy; [Trama, Annalisa] Fdn IRCCS Ist Nazl Tumori, Evaluat Epidemiol Unit, Milan, Italy; [Marino, Mirella] Regina Elena Inst Canc Res, Dept Pathol, Rome, Italy";Imbimbo, M (corresponding author), Fdn IRCCS Ist Nazl Tumori, Med Oncol Dept 1, Thorac Oncol Unit, Via Giacomo Venezian 1, I-20133 Milan, Italy.;martina.imbimbo@istitutotumori.mi.it;"Perrino, Matteo/AAC-5580-2019; Zucali, Paolo/AAC-9757-2020; Torri, Valter/AAH-5705-2019; Alessi, Alessandra/C-7537-2017; Petrini, Iacopo/P-9318-2019; Tos, Angelo Dei/AAN-3244-2020; Trama, Annalisa/C-1092-2017; Caraceni, Augusto/C-1012-2017; Franceschini, Davide/AAB-3871-2019; Sangalli, Claudia/D-4339-2017; Marino, Mirella/A-7548-2018; Imbimbo, Martina/K-4510-2016; Casali, Paolo Giovanni/D-1524-2017";"Torri, Valter/0000-0001-9541-9354; Alessi, Alessandra/0000-0003-3853-1926; Petrini, Iacopo/0000-0002-7752-6866; Trama, Annalisa/0000-0001-8220-9833; Caraceni, Augusto/0000-0002-0375-6204; Franceschini, Davide/0000-0003-1142-2439; Sangalli, Claudia/0000-0002-6465-0630; PASELLO, GIULIA/0000-0002-8741-6038; Marino, Mirella/0000-0002-0045-0234; Fiore, Michele/0000-0003-1889-4578; DEI TOS, ANGELO/0000-0002-1228-8940; Imbimbo, Martina/0000-0003-2521-7540; Casali, Paolo Giovanni/0000-0003-4056-8023; Roca, Elisa/0000-0001-7625-7708";;;;71;13;13;2;6;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;0305-7372;1532-1967;;CANCER TREAT REV;Cancer Treat.

Experts often base their interventions to support farmers to adapt to climate change on their own perception of farmers' livelihood risks. However, if differences in risk perception between farmers and experts exist, these interventions might fail. Thus, for effective design and implementation of adaptation strategies for farmers, it is necessary to understand farmers' perception and how it influences their decision-making. We analyze farmers' and experts' systemic view on climate change threats in relation to other agricultural livelihood risks and assess the differences between their perceptions. For Cauca, Colombia, we found that experts and farmers perceived climate-related and other livelihood risks differently. While farmers' perceived risks were a failure in crop production and lack of access to health and educational services, experts, in contrast, perceived insecurity and the unreliable weather to be the highest risks for farmers. On barriers that prevent farmers from taking action against risks, experts perceived both external factors such as the national policy and internal factors such as the adaptive capacity of farmers to be the main barriers. Farmers ranked the lack of information, especially about weather and climate, as their main barrier to adapt. Effective policies aiming at climate change adaptation need to relate climate change risks to other production risks as farmers often perceive climate change in the context of other risks. Policymakers in climate change need to consider differences in risk perception.;"[Eitzinger, Anton] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Km 17,Recta Cali Palmira 6713,Apartado Aereo, Cali 763537, Colombia; [Eitzinger, Anton; Binder, Claudia R.; Meyer, Markus A.] Univ Munich LMU, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Binder, Claudia R.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, ENAC, IIE, Lab Human Environm Relat Urban Syst, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland";"Eitzinger, A (corresponding author), Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Km 17,Recta Cali Palmira 6713,Apartado Aereo, Cali 763537, Colombia.; Eitzinger, A (corresponding author), Univ Munich LMU, Dept Geog, Luisenstr 37, D-80333 Munich, Germany.";"a.eitzinger@cgiar.org; claudia.binder@epfl.ch; markus.a.meyer@gmail.com";"Meyer, Markus/AAY-9170-2020; Meyer, Markus/AAV-5608-2020; Eitzinger, Anton/AAU-4960-2020";"Meyer, Markus/0000-0002-9463-1975; Eitzinger, Anton/0000-0001-7317-3381";"CGIAR FundCGIAR; International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT); Fundacion Ecohabitats";This work was implemented as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), which is carried out with support from the CGIAR Fund Donors and through bilateral funding agreements.

The Allergy Diary Companion app for healthcare providers is currently being developed and will be launched in 2018. It incorporates the AR CDSS to provide evidence-based treatment recommendations, linking all key stakeholders in AR management. Objective: To produce an electronic version of the AR CDSS (e-CDSS) for incorporation into the Allergy Diary Companion, to describe the app interfaces used to collect information necessary to inform the e-CDSS and to summarize some key features of the Allergy Diary Companion. Methods: The steps involved in producing the e-CDSS and incorporating it into the Allergy Diary Companion were (a) generation of treatment management scenarios; (b) expert consensus on treatment recommendations; (c) generation of electronic decisional algorithms to describe all AR CDSS scenarios; (d) digitization of these algorithms to form the e-CDSS; and (e) embedding the e-CDSS into the app to permit easy user e-CDSS interfacing. Results: Key experts in the AR field agreed on the AR CDSS approach to AR management and on specific treatment recommendations provided by Allergy Diary Companion. Based on this consensus, decision processes were developed and programmed into the Allergy Diary Companion using Titanium Appcelerator (JavaScript) for IOS tablets. To our knowledge, this is the first time the development of any m-health tool has been described in this transparent and detailed way, providing confidence, not only in the app, but also in the provided management recommendations. Conclusion: The Allergy Diary Companion for providers provides guideline and expert-endorsed AR management recommendations.

Currently, a behavioral marker system with structured taxonomy of nontechnical skills in crisis management is lacking in the nursing literature. This article outlines the development of a skills taxonomy, which will form the basis of the behavioral marker system that we aim to develop in our next phase of study. Methods: We audio-recorded 50 registered nurses and enrolled nurses over five simulation debriefing sessions. We analyzed the data using a thematic analysis approach and developed a skills taxonomy. To ensure face validation, we invited four experts to review the skills taxonomy and to comment on each behavior's observability. Results: We developed a skills taxonomy comprising six categories and 18 underlying observable behaviors (elements). The developed categories are task and resource management, situational awareness, teamwork, communication, control of emotions, and leadership. Conclusion: We have developed a skills taxonomy fostering the use of a common terminology for nontechnical skills in nursing crisis-management teams. Further work to develop a rating system and to test its reliability will be conducted. (C) 2018 International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning.

These processes require the participation and continuous supervision of professionals with highly-developed expert sensory abilities. Training of these experts is very complex due to the difficulty of transmitting intuitive knowledge obtained from perception. A new methodology for capturing this sensory expert knowledge that relies on a machine learning tool, previously trained with 'state-action' type patterns, jointly with an actions generator module, is proposed in this work. The method is based on a closed loop architecture together with the decomposition of complex sensory knowledge into basic elements capable of being handled by standard machine learning systems. A real case application to color-adjustment in the automotive paint manufacturing industry is presented showing the potential benefits of the method.

Excavations hoping to find compelling evidence of powerful rulers, such as a royal tomb, keep coming away empty-handed. But the alternative possibility of collective rule still remains poorly understood as well. Previously we used a computational model of this city's hypothetical sociopolitical network to show that in principle collective rule based on communal ritual could be an effective strategy of ensuring widespread social coordination, as long as we assume that the network's structure could be transformed via social learning and local leaders were not strongly subdivided. Here we extended this model to investigate whether increased social hierarchy could mitigate the negative effects of such strong divisions. We found a special synergy between social hierarchy and communal ritual: only their combination improved the extent of social coordination, whereas the introduction of centralization and top-down influence by themselves had no effect. This finding is consistent with portrayals of the Teotihuacan elite as religious specialists serving the public good, in particular by synchronizing the city's ritual calendar with the rhythms of the stars.

Current methods such as econometric modelling or structural equation modelling face challenges related to how causality is established due to potential issues regarding cross-sectional data sets. To address this gap, this paper suggests a total interpretive structural modelling based approach. We use graph theory logic to synthesize expert interpretations in the form of a theoretical supply chain model. This method may prove to be an alternative method to econometric based modelling or structural equation modelling. We provide an application of the method in exploring the drivers of low carbon supply chain and their relationships.

Our remote collaboration system shares a live video of a local user's real-world task space with a remote user. The remote user can have an independent view or a dependent view of a shared real-world object manipulation task and can draw virtual annotations onto the real-world objects as a visual communication cue. With the system, we investigated two different collaboration styles; (1) remote expert collaboration where a remote user has the solution and gives instructions to a local partner and (2) mutual collaboration where neither user has a solution but both remote and local users share ideas and discuss ways to solve the real-world task. In the user study, the remote expert collaboration showed a number of benefits over the mutual collaboration. With the remote expert collaboration, participants had better communication from the remote user to the local user, more aligned focus between participants, and the remote participants' feeling of enjoyment and togetherness. However, the benefits were not always apparent at the local participants' end, especially with measures of enjoyment and togetherness. The independent view also had several benefits over the dependent view, such as allowing remote participants to freely navigate around the workspace while having a wider fully zoomed-out view. The benefits of the independent view were more prominent in the mutual collaboration than in the remote expert collaboration, especially in enabling the remote participants to see the workspace.";"[Kim, Seungwon; Billinghurst, Mark; Lee, Gun] Univ South Australia, Sch Informat Technol & Math Sci, Mawson Lakes Campus, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia";Kim, S (corresponding author), Univ South Australia, Sch Informat Technol & Math Sci, Mawson Lakes Campus, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia.;"Seungwon.Kim@unisa.edu.au; Mark.Billinghurst@unisa.edu.au; Gun.Lee@unisa.edu.au";;"Billinghurst, Mark/0000-0003-4172-6759; Kim, Seungwon/0000-0003-4221-3058; Lee, Gun/0000-0002-1644-6934";;;;56;16;16;2;17;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0925-9724;1573-7551;;COMPUT SUPP COOP W J;Comput.

J;Bilalic, M;;;;Bilalic, Merim;;;The Double Take of Expertise: Neural Expansion Is Associated With Outstanding Performance;CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE;;;English;Article;;;;;;"expertise; neural efficiency; object recognition; pattern recognition";"CHESS PLAYERS; RECOGNITION; NETWORKS; MEMORY";The performance of experts seems almost effortless. The neural-efficiency hypothesis takes this into account, suggesting that because of practice and automatization of procedures, experts require fewer brain resources. Here, I argue that the way the brain accommodates complex skills does indeed have to do with the nature of experts' performance. However, instead of exhibiting less brain activation, experts' performance actually engages more brain areas. Behind the seemingly effortless performance of experts lies a complex cognitive system that relies on knowledge about the domain of expertise. Unlike novices, who need to execute one process at a time, experts are able to recognize an object, retrieve its function, and connect it to another object simultaneously. The expert brain deals with this computational burden by engaging not only specific brain areas in one hemisphere but also the same (homologous) area in the opposite hemisphere. This phenomenon, which I call the double take of expertise, has been observed in a number of expertise domains. I describe it here in object- and pattern-recognition tasks in the domain of chess. I also discuss the importance of the study of expertise for our understanding of the human brain in general.;[Bilalic, Merim] Univ Northumbria Newcastle, Dept Psychol, Ellison Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England;Bilalic, M (corresponding author), Univ Northumbria Newcastle, Dept Psychol, Ellison Bldg, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.;merim.bilalic@northumbria.ac.uk;;;Oesterreichischen Nationalbank Jubilaumsfondsprojekt [16449];This work was supported by Oesterreichischen Nationalbank Jubilaumsfondsprojekt 16449 to M.

A variety of factors contribute to the age-related increase in the incidence of diabetes. The lack of empiric evidence in the field has limited the management guidelines to mostly expert opinion. Given uncertainty over the rate at which to lower blood glucose levels and the optimal method of doing so, the goals of diabetes control in older people must be individualized. If the patient requires insulin therapy, the newer insulins, with their improved pharmacodynamic consistency and reduced risk of hypoglycemia, should be preferred. Several oral agents are preferable for people with sufficient endogenous insulin because they do not cause hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy. Some of these oral agents have been found to have cardioprotective effects. Older people with diabetes also require management of the other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, with antihypertensive drugs, cholesterol-lowering agents and low-dose aspirin. However, the precise targets for blood pressure control and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels continue to evolve as more data become available. Diabetes care in older adults should focus on enhancing the individual's quality of life rather than trying to normalize blood glucose levels or reach predetermined blood pressure and LDL cholesterol targets.;[Mooradian, Arshag D.] Univ Florida, Coll Med, Dept Med, LRC, 653-1 West 8th St,4th Floor, Jacksonville, FL 32209 USA;Mooradian, AD (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Coll Med, Dept Med, LRC, 653-1 West 8th St,4th Floor, Jacksonville, FL 32209 USA.;arshag.mooradian@jax.ufl.edu;;;;;;126;8;8;0;6;ADIS INT LTD;NORTHCOTE;5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND;1170-229X;1179-1969;;DRUG AGING;Drugs Aging;DEC;2018;35;12;;;;;1065;1078;;10.1007/s40266-018-0598-3;;;14;"Geriatrics & Gerontology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy";"Geriatrics & Gerontology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy";HB9MI;WOS:000451415000004;30306360;;;;2021-02-18;

We systematically evaluated the accuracy of BAV diagnosis in a large healthcare system of multiple echocardiography laboratories. Methods and Results: Aurora Health Care is a multihospital, multi-clinic system across the state of Wisconsin encompassing 33 inpatient and outpatient echocardiography laboratories with 39 cardiologist readers and 72 sonographers. As all laboratories store echocardiograms in one database, we queried all patients with bicuspid aortic valve diagnosis on echocardiography. Echocardiograms were classified as BAV or possible BAV based on initial reader confidence. An expert review panel categorized each as BAV, no BAV, or Indeterminate. Of the 745 cases identified, 589 (79.1%, initial reader interpretation: n = 494 BAV, n = 95 possible) were BAV. A high level of agreement (84%) was present in BAV diagnosis. There were 156 (20.9%) echocardiograms that were no BAV (8.4%) or Indeterminate (12.4%). We identified three common reasons for misdiagnosis: poor image quality (n = 70, 44.9%), leaflet calcium (n = 44, 28.2%), and oblique axis imaging (n = 33, 21.1%). A clear reason for misclassification was not elucidated in nine cases (n = 9, 5.7%). Conclusions: This is the first study to evaluate BAV accuracy across a community health system with multiple echocardiography laboratories and a heterogeneous group of readers and sonographers. We establish a high degree of accuracy of echo-cardiography in BAV diagnosis and draw attention to common echocardiographic pitfalls that lead to BAV misclassification, highlighting opportunities for education and quality improvement.;"[Jain, Renuka; Ammar, Khawaja Afzal; Kalvin, Lindsey; Ignatowski, Denise; Tajik, A.

We aimed to quantify the effect of beneficial agricultural practices on ES delivery, and to develop and apply a generic framework of management-based payments for ES (PES). We carried out a Delphi expert consultation (researchers and technicians/managers) on the interface agriculture-environment by which we measured the contribution of current agricultural practices at farm level to relevant ES in Mediterranean agroecosystems. Next, we designed a novel framework of PES that used these contributions to rank the practices that satisfied three agri-environmental policy objectives (equal importance of ES, focus on biodiversity and climate, and focus on social demands). We found that the relative contribution of practices to individual ES delivery was rather similar, especially for those ES influenced by many agricultural practices. However, when considering different objectives in the PES framework, differences in practice prioritization were apparent. The framework was able to reward farmers according to their objective contribution to conservation priorities. The PES system also showed that grazing management practices were multifunctional and delivered ES in bundles.;"[Rodriguez-Ortega, T.; Bernues, A.] Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon CITA, Zaragoza, Spain; [Olaizola, A.

The rich knowledge conveyed in logs is highly leveraged by researchers and practitioners in performing various tasks, both in software development and its operation. Log-related issues, such as missing or having outdated information, may have a large impact on the users who depend on these logs. In this paper, we first perform an empirical study on log-related issues in two large-scale, open source software systems. We find that the files with log-related issues have undergone statistically significantly more frequent prior changes, and bug fixes. We also find that developers fixing these log-related issues are often not the ones who introduced the logging statement nor the owner of the method containing the logging statement. Maintaining logs is more challenging without clear experts. Finally, we find that most of the defective logging statements remain unreported for a long period (median 320 days). Once reported, the issues are fixed quickly (median five days). Our empirical findings suggest the need for automated tools that can detect log-related issues promptly. We conducted a manual study and identified seven root-causes of the log-related issues. Based on these root causes, we developed an automated tool that detects four evident types of log-related issues. Our tool can detect 75 existing inappropriate logging statements reported in 40 log-related issues. We also reported new issues found by our tool to developers and 38 previously unknown issues in the latest release of the subject systems were accepted by developers.;"[Hassani, Mehran; Shang, Weiyi; Shihab, Emad; Tsantalis, Nikolaos] Concordia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada";Hassani, M (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;"m_assani@encs.concordia.ca; shang@encs.concordia.ca; shihab@encs.concordia.ca; tsantalis@encs.concordia.ca";Tsantalis, Nikolaos/AAR-7845-2020;Tsantalis, Nikolaos/0000-0003-2508-3845;;;;45;2;2;0;2;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1382-3256;1573-7616;;EMPIR SOFTW ENG;Empir.

For the electricity distribution industry, this has contributed to a growing need to understand how these network monopolies should adapt their role, activities, and responsibilities for a redesigned electricity market, given the growth of distributed generation, and the increased control and monitoring capabilities. Considering this, a foresight study on business model innovation, technological adaptation, and market design policy alternatives is presented. A Policy Delphi method was applied, involving two iterative survey rounds and 207 European experts, which assessed 57 policy alternatives. The results highlight adaptation challenges for implementing new technologies and business practices. Experts support innovation and transition to new roles, and innovative services, while warranting that core electricity distribution activities are secured. This shift in roles is expected to be achieved through research and development (R&D) support policies, innovation friendly regulatory frameworks, and concerted actions at the EU and Member States level.

The way food and nutrition security problems and solutions are understood by decision makers and researchers inevitably influences interventions in food systems. One novel way of capturing different and potentially competing understandings of food and nutrition security problems and solutions is transdisciplinary research. In this paper, we examine how Southeast Asian policy and research experts working in food and nutrition security frame challenges and solutions, and the implications of this understanding for their capacity to adopt initiatives from emerging transdisciplinary research in the region. We conducted a workshop with research and policy experts from four countries in Southeast Asia and used a systems based human ecology framework to capture the common understanding participants have of the main challenges in their food systems. The systems exercises revealed similarities in the dominant framing presented by researchers and policy makers, and of the respective agencies of key stakeholders. We found that formal government policy and training was commonly perceived as major drivers of change, with smallholder farmers viewed as passive recipients of knowledge. We also found there is ongoing interest in increasing productivity of key commodities, but there is critical awareness of the environmental consequences of production-oriented agriculture. These dominant understandings have implications for current regional initiatives in transdisciplinary research that seek to build farmer capacity, reduce inequality, and include different stakeholders in research and policy activities. We conclude by arguing that research agencies aspiring to inform policy interventions based on transdisciplinary processes will face challenges given the current dominant frames of food systems in the region. We show how human ecology and systems frameworks can guide transdisciplinary food systems research that aims to improve food and nutrition security.;"[Davila, Federico; Dyball, Robert; Amparo, Jennifer Marie] Australian Natl Univ, 141 Linnaeus Way, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Davila, Federico] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Sustainable Futures, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Davila, Federico; Dyball, Robert] Univ Philippines, Southeast Asian Reg Ctr Grad Study & Res Agr SEAR, Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines; [Dyball, Robert; Amparo, Jennifer Marie] Univ Philippines, Coll Human Ecol, Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines";Davila, F (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, 141 Linnaeus Way, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.;"federico.davila@anu.edu.au; rob.dyball@anu.edu.au; Jennifer.amparo@anu.edu.au";;Davila, Federico/0000-0002-6899-1854;"Southeast Asian Regional Centre for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture; Australian Government Research Training Program ScholarshipAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science; Australia Awards Scholarship";This study and the authors were supported by the Southeast Asian Regional Centre for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture.

A water safety plan (WSP) presents a systematic approach to ensuring the health and quality of drinking water. This study assessed the drinking water supply system safety of Birjand city using the WHO's WSP. Methods: This investigation employed the WSP-QA Tool and the WSP manual of the WHO and the AWI. For this purpose, software checklists were prepared and, after confirmation of content and face validity, completed based on Birjand's water and wastewater company records and interview with company's experts. Data was analyzed using WSP-QA Tool. Results: From total possible 440 points for full use of the program and 328 points of the studied phases, a score of 190 was acquired, indicating a 43.18% coordinated implementation with WSP. System description and management procedures showed the maximum and minimum percentages of congruency with the WSP of 87.5% and 25%, respectively. Among the components of the water supply system, water resource had the most attention. Conclusion: As regards the percentage of overall WSP-phase implementation and the low attention given to some key parameters of the water supply system, such as risk assessment and management procedures, the system currently enjoys a relatively medium level of safety. However, the high points of some phases such as system description, operational monitoring and verification enhance the system's flexibility for changing the current approach of qualitative management to the WSP.;"[Eslami, Akbar] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Environm & Occupat Hazards Control Res Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Ghaffari, Mohtasham] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Educ & Hlth, Tehran, Iran; [Barikbin, Behnam] Birjand Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Birjand, Iran; [Fanaei, Farzaneh] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Tehran, Iran";Fanaei, F (corresponding author), Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Tehran, Iran.;fanaei70@gmail.com;"amiri, omolbanin/G-4425-2017; Eslami, Akbar/J-1191-2017";"amiri, omolbanin/0000-0002-3815-5716; Eslami, Akbar/0000-0001-7856-2677";;;;30;4;4;0;4;KERMAN UNIV MEDICAL SCIENCES;KERMAN;JAHAD BLVD, KERMAN, 7619813159, IRAN;2423-3765;2423-4311;;ENV HEALTH ENG MANAG;Environ.

Over recent years a huge library of DM algorithms has been developed to tackle a variety of problems in fields such as medical imaging and traffic analysis. Many DM techniques are far more flexible than more classical numerial simulation or statistical modelling approaches. These could be usefully applied to data-rich environmental problems. Certain techniques such as artificial neural networks, clustering, case-based reasoning or Bayesian networks have been applied in environmental modelling, while other methods, like support vector machines among others, have yet to be taken up on a wide scale. There is greater scope for many lesser known techniques to be applied in environmental research, with the potential to contribute to addressing some of the current open environmental challenges. However, selecting the best DM technique for a given environmental problem is not a simple decision, and there is a lack of guidelines and criteria that helps the data scientist and environmental scientists to ensure effective knowledge extraction from data. This paper provides a broad introduction to the use of DM in Data Science processes for environmental researchers. Data Science contains three main steps (pre-processing, data mining and post-processing). This paper provides a conceptualization of Environmental Systems and a conceptualization of DM methods, which are in the core step of the Data Science process. These two elements define a conceptual framework that is on the basis of a new methodology proposed for relating the characteristics of a given environmental problem with a family of Data Mining methods. The paper provides a general overview and guidelines of DM techniques to a non-expert user, who can decide with this support which is the more suitable technique to solve their problem at hand. The decision is related to the bidimensional relationship between the type of environmental system and the type of DM method. An illustrative two way table containing references for each pair Environmental System-Data Mining method is presented and discussed. Some examples of how the proposed methodology is used to support DM method selection are also presented, and challenges and future trends are identified.;"[Gibert, Karina; Sanchez-Marre, Miquel] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Knowledge Engn & Machine Learning Grp, Intelligent Data Sci & Artificial Intelligence Re, BarcelonaTech, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Gibert, Karina] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Stat & Operat Res, BarcelonaTech, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Sanchez-Marre, Miquel] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Computat Sci, BarcelonaTech, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Izquierdo, Joaquin] Univ Politecn Valencia, Fluing IMM, Valencia, Spain; [Hamilton, Serena H.] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Sci, Joondalup, Australia; [Hamilton, Serena H.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Rodriguez-Roda, Ignasi] Univ Girona, Lab Chem & Environm Engn LEQUIA, Catalonia, Spain; [Rodriguez-Roda, Ignasi] Catalan Inst Water Res ICRA, Girona, Catalonia, Spain; [Holmes, Geoff] Univ Waikato, Dept Comp Sci, Waikato, New Zealand";Gibert, K (corresponding author), UPC, Intelligent Data Sci & Artificial Intelligence Re, Knowledge Engn & Machine Learning Grp, C Jordi Girona 1-3, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.;karina.gibert@upc.edu;"Sanchez-Marre, Miquel/AAF-6188-2020; Hamilton, Serena/T-6406-2019; Rodriguez-Roda, Ignasi/D-4817-2015; Snow, Val O/O-8693-2016; Izquierdo, Joaquin/H-6436-2015";"Rodriguez-Roda, Ignasi/0000-0002-8989-9061; Snow, Val O/0000-0002-6911-8184; Sanchez-Marre, Miquel/0000-0001-9848-5779; Izquierdo, Joaquin/0000-0002-6625-7226";;;;271;11;12;4;36;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;1364-8152;1873-6726;;ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW;Environ.

Environmental concerns are encouraging the use of alternative resources and lower emissions to air, water and soil. Innovative technologies to deal with waste recovery that produce marketable bioproducts are emerging. Bioelectrochemical synthesis systems (BESs) are based on the primary principle of transforming organic waste into added-value products using microorganisms to catalyse chemical reactions. This technology is at the core of a research project called BIORARE (BIoelectrosynthesis for ORganic wAste bioREfinery), an interdisciplinary project that aims to use anaerobic digestion as a supply chain to feed a BES and produce target biomolecules. This technology needs to be driven by environmental strategies. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to evaluate the BIORARE concept based on expert opinion and prior experiments for the production of biosuccinic acid and waste management. A multidisciplinary approach based on biochemistry and process engineering expertise was used to collect the inventory data. The BES design and the two-step anaerobic digestion process have many potential impacts on air pollution or ecotoxicity-related categories. The comparison of the BIORARE concept with conventional fermentation processes and a water-fed BES technology demonstrated the environmental benefit resulting from the use of both the BES technology and a waste-based substrate as input thus supporting the BIORARE concept. Some trade-offs among the impact categories were identified but led to options to improve the concept. BES design and synergy management may improve the environmental performance of the BIORARE concept.;"[Foulet, Amandine; Giard, Lucas; Aissani, Lynda] Irstea, UR OPAALE, F-35044 Rennes, France; [Bouchez, Theodore] Irstea, UR HBAN, F-92761 Antony, France; [Desmond-Le Quemener, Elie] INRA, LBE, Narbonne, France; [Renvoise, Laure] Suez Environm CIRSEE, Le Pecq, France";Aissani, L (corresponding author), Irstea, UR OPAALE, F-35044 Rennes, France.;lynda.aissani@irstea.fr;BOUCHEZ, Theodore/AAC-4652-2021;"BOUCHEZ, Theodore/0000-0002-2236-8282; Aissani, Lynda/0000-0002-0736-2691; Le Quemener, Elie/0000-0003-1675-2744";French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-BTBR-02];The authors would like to thank the French National Research Agency for supporting the BIORARE project (ANR-10-BTBR-02).;;79;7;7;2;43;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;0944-1344;1614-7499;;ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R;Environ.

The Austrian Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology defined a consensus of five recommendations to avoid overuse of medical interventions and to improve care of geriatric patients. Methods From an initial pool of 147 reliable recommendations, 20 were chosen by a structured selection process for inclusion in a Delphi process to define a list of five top recommendations for geriatric medicine. 12 experts in the field of geriatric medicine scored the recommendations in two Delphi rounds. Results The final five recommendations are concerning urinary catheters in elderly patients, percutaneous feeding tubes in patients with advanced dementia, antipsychotics as the first choice to treat behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and screening for breast, colorectal, prostate, or lung cancer, and the use of antimicrobials to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria. Conclusions The selected recommendations have the potential to improve medical care for older patients, to reduce side effects caused by unnecessary medical procedures, and to save costs in the health care system.;"[Schippinger, Walter] Albert Schweitzer Hosp, Geriatr Hlth Ctr Graz, Dept Internal Med & Acute Geriatr, Graz, Austria; [Glechner, Anna] Danube Univ Krems, Dept Evidence Based Med & Clin Epidemiol, Krems An Der Donau, Austria; [Horvath, Karl] Med Univ Graz, Inst Gen Practice & Evidence Based Hlth Serv Res, Graz, Austria; [Sommeregger, Ulrike; Fruehwald, Thomas] Social Med Ctr East, Dept Acute Geriatr, Vienna, Austria; [Dovjak, Peter] Hosp Salzkammergut, Dept Acute Geriatr & Remobilisat, Gmunden, Austria; [Pinter, Georg] Hosp Klagenfurt, Dept Acute Geriatr, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Iglseder, Bernhard] Private Med Univ Paracelsus, Christian Doppler Univ, Hosp Salzburg, Dept Geriatr, Salzburg, Austria; [Mrak, Peter] Gen Hosp West Styria, Dept Internal Med 2, Voitsberg, Austria; [Mueller, Walter] Gen Publ Hosp Order St Elisabeth, Dept Acute Geriatr & Remobilisat, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Ohrenberger, Gerald] Long Term Care Hosp, House Mercy, Vienna, Austria; [Mann, Eva] Private Med Univ Paracelsus, Inst Gen Family & Prevent Med, Salzburg, Austria; [Boehmdorfer, Birgit] Hosp Hietzing Neurol Ctr Rosenhugel, Pharm Dept, Vienna, Austria; [Roller-Wirnsberger, Regina] Med Univ Graz, Dept Internal Med, Auenbruggerpl 15, A-8036 Graz, Austria";Roller-Wirnsberger, R (corresponding author), Med Univ Graz, Dept Internal Med, Auenbruggerpl 15, A-8036 Graz, Austria.;Regina.Roller-Wirnsberger@medunigraz.at;Dovjak, Peter/N-8165-2014;Dovjak, Peter/0000-0003-4667-8805;"Main Association of Austrian Social Security Institutions (Hauptverband der Osterreichischen Sozialversicherungstrager); Department of Health and Welfare of the province of Styria";The work was supported by a restricted grant from the Main Association of Austrian Social Security Institutions (Hauptverband der Osterreichischen Sozialversicherungstrager) and the Department of Health and Welfare of the province of Styria (Steirischer Gesundheitsfond) for administration of the research.;;40;2;2;0;3;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1878-7649;1878-7657;;EUR GERIATR MED;Eur.

The original intraprocedural CECTs were de-enhanced to create a virtually unenhanced CT image (VUCT). Alignment of diagnostic CECTs to their corresponding intraprocedural VUCTs was performed with non-rigid or rigid registration. Mental registration was performed by four interventional radiologists. The original intraprocedural CECT served as the reference standard. Accuracy of tumour localisation was assessed with the target registration error (TRE). Statistical differences were analysed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.ResultsNon-rigid registration failed to register two CT datasets, incorporating four tumours. In the remaining 33 datasets, non-rigid, rigid and mental registration showed a median TRE of 3.9 mm, 9.0 mm and 10.9 mm, respectively. Non-rigid registration was significantly more accurate in tumour centre localisation in comparison to rigid (p < 0.001) or mental registration (p < 0.001). Rigid registration was not statistically different from mental registration (p = 0.169). Non-rigid registration was most accurate in localising tumour centres in 42 out of 52 tumours (80.8%), while rigid and mental registration were most accurate in only seven (13.5%) and three (5.8%) tumours, respectively.ConclusionsComputer-based non-rigid registration is statistically significantly more accurate in localising liver tumours in intraprocedural unenhanced CT images in comparison to rigid registration or interventional radiologists' mental mapping abilities.Key Points center dot Computer-based non-rigid registration is better (p < 0.001) in localising target tumours prior to ablation in intraprocedural CT images in comparison to rigid registration or interventional radiologists' mental mapping abilities.center dot Human experts perform sub-optimal localisation of target tumours when relying solely on mental mapping during challenging CT-guided procedures.center dot This non-rigid registration method shows promising results as a safe alternative to intravenous contrast media in liver tumour localisation prior to ablation during CT-guided procedures.;"[Boulkhrif, Hassan; van Walsum, Theo; Moelker, Adriaan] Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Dept Radiol & Nucl Med, Erasmus MC, Wytemaweg 80, NL-3015 CN Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Ha Manh Luu; van Walsum, Theo] Erasmus MC, Dept Med Informat, Room Na 2506,Wytemaweg 80, NL-3015 CN Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Ha Manh Luu] Vietnam Natl Univ Hanoi, Univ Engn & Technol, Avitech, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Ha Manh Luu] Vietnam Natl Univ Hanoi, Univ Engn & Technol, FET, Hanoi, Vietnam";Boulkhrif, H (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Rotterdam, Dept Radiol & Nucl Med, Erasmus MC, Wytemaweg 80, NL-3015 CN Rotterdam, Netherlands.;h.boulkhrif@erasmusmc.nl;;Boulkhrif, Hassan/0000-0001-8359-0816;ITEA [13031];This study has received funding by ITEA.

Two independent (non-voting) authors facilitated the procedure and resolved doubtful issues. Updated musculoskeletal ultrasound literature up to July 2017 was scored for shoulder, elbow, wrist/hand, hip, knee, and ankle/foot. Scoring of ultrasound elastography was included. The strength of the recommendation and level of evidence was scored by consensus greater than 67% or considered uncertain when the consensus was consensus less than 67%.ResultsA total of 123 new papers were reviewed. No evidence change was found regarding the shoulder. There were no new relevant articles for the shoulder, 10 new articles for the elbow, 28 for the hand/wrist, 3 for the hip, 7 for the knee, and 4 for the ankle/foot. Four new evidence levels of A were determined, one for the hip (gluteal tendons tears), one for the knee (meniscal cysts), one for the ankle (ankle joint instability), and one for the foot (plantar plate tear). There was no level A evidence for elastography, although for Achilles tendinopathy and lateral epicondylitis evidence level was B with grade 3 indication.ConclusionsFour new areas of level A evidence were included in the guidelines.

Although Timor-Leste is a relatively small nation, its varied topography contains a rich diversity in agricultural livelihoods, from coffee covered mountains, to dryland-swidden agriculture. Each of the livelihoods are very complex, with a single household often managing more than 10 crop and 4-5 animal species in very small holdings. Using census data from each village only, statistical clustering analysis was used to group villages with similar levels of participation in crop and livestock production. The clustered village groups were then mapped, and it was seen that villages in each cluster, occupied particular locations. Using expert knowledge about the locations of each cluster, livelihood zones based on a small number of rules were defined to mimic the output of the clustering. Seven livelihood zones were identified from mapping the livelihood systems. These included three zones with irrigation (rice-based), two highland zones (coffee-based) and two lowland zones based on rain-fed agriculture. Government and development agencies have endorsed the typology of livelihood zones, which is now in use for planning and decision-making. The technique of using national census data to define agricultural zones through statistical clustering can be replicated wherever there is reliable village-level census data.;"[Williams, Robert L.; Bacon, Samuel; Ferreira, Adalfredo] Seeds Life Timor Leste, POB 221, Dili, Timor-Leste; [Williams, Robert L.; Bacon, Samuel; Ferreira, Adalfredo] MAF, Comoro, Dili, Timor-Leste; [Williams, Robert L.; Erskine, William] Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, Ctr Plant Genet & Breeding PGB, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Erskine, William] Univ Western Australia, Inst Agr, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia";"Williams, RL (corresponding author), Seeds Life Timor Leste, POB 221, Dili, Timor-Leste.; Williams, RL (corresponding author), MAF, Comoro, Dili, Timor-Leste.; Williams, RL (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, Ctr Plant Genet & Breeding PGB, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.";rob.williams@seedsoflifetimor.org;;Erskine, William/0000-0002-2074-4299;"Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res; Australian Government DFAT";The authors wish to gratefully acknowledge the support of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), the Australian Government DFAT and to the Seeds of Life program.

J;Amarowicz, M;;;;Amarowicz, Marcin;;;Requirements-based approach for the diagnostic systems design process;EXPERT SYSTEMS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"diagnostic systems; expert systems; knowledge representation; requirements";FAULT-DETECTION;The process of effective diagnosis of the technical state of an object is an essential task related to its utilization. For this purpose, appropriately developed diagnostic systems are used. However, the process of their elaboration is very difficult because it is necessary to consider very wide domain knowledge during this process-for example, information about the object's structure, possible faults, results of risk analysis, and available diagnostic methods. Generally, in the literature, there are no adequate methods for the purpose of designing diagnostic systems. In this article, a new design approach for this purpose is proposed. It is based on some elements of requirement engineering and the selected methods of artificial intelligence. The main assumptions of the proposed design approach rely on the use of sets of requirements to describe the expected functionalities of the diagnostic system. Each of the requirements is connected with proper faults that may occur during the operation of the considered object, is described by a set of attributes, and implies the partial solution of the diagnostic system. A gathered set of requirements is evaluated using the expert system, such as the inference process in Bayesian networks. The structure of these networks depends on the obtained notation of the requirements.

The current best practice to rate journal quality is to combine journal bibliometrics with expert assessment. For example, the Association of Business Schools (ABS) Journal Guide generated by this method is widely used by many business schools. However, different journal bibliometrics calculated in the citation network sometimes provide inconsistent ranking, and it is hard for domain experts to utilize the conflicting information. Therefore, given a journal, if the ABS Scientific Committee members are not familiar with it and different journal bibliometrics provide conflicting information, the given journal is hard to be rated and will not be included in the ABS journal list. In order to solve the above issue and maintain a comprehensive list of journals in the management information systems (MIS) field, this paper proposes a data-driven method to predict the ABS rating based on six popular bibliometrics for any given MIS journal. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first work on this type to predict ABS ratings, which can serve as a more reliable rating reference and is much easier to be used to generate the rating for a comprehensive list of journals in the MIS field. In this paper, comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the rating performance of our method from four different perspectives, including new journals, top journals, and interdisciplinary journals, and identifying overrated and underrated journals by ABS. Experiment results show our method can provide very reliable estimated ABS ratings for most MIS journals with few exceptions. Since our method is not perfect, expert knowledge is encouraged to be included to correct our estimated ABS ratings. However, such correction must be conducted under the following two constraints. First, domain experts must have sufficient evidences to do the correction. Second, correction can be adding or subtracting 1, but not beyond 1.;"[Duan, Lian; Nasri, Farrokh; Paknejad, Javad] Hofstra Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Business Analytd, Hempstead, NY 11550 USA";Duan, L (corresponding author), Hofstra Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Business Analytd, Hempstead, NY 11550 USA.;lian.duan@hofstra.edu;;Duan, Lian/0000-0002-0618-8628;;;;29;1;1;1;15;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0266-4720;1468-0394;;EXPERT SYST;Expert Syst.;DEC;2018;35;6;;;;;;;e12309;10.1111/exsy.12309;;;12;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;HD2BS;WOS:000452316700006;;;;;2021-02-18;

This process, measured in weeks or months, is usually performed manually by a technician with the support of computer software. Although various techniques have been developed in recent years to solve this complex problem, they all require improvement. This study aimed to develop a new technique and produce applicable redistribution plans using a genetic algorithm (GA) in combination with an expert system. Blocks of cadastral parcels were determined by a GA using a new objective function to consider the overflow and residual areas as well as the landowners' preferences. The expert system was employed to close (reduce to zero) the overflow or residual areas occurring after the GA distribution. To investigate the performance of the proposed method, the system was used on a real study area and the results were compared against those obtained for the same cadastral situation undertaken by a technician using a similar method from published literature. The experimental results showed that the method proposed in this study performed better than the other methods because it provided a successful and applicable redistribution plan for the study area in a much shorter time.;"[Hakli, Huseyin] Necmettin Erbakan Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-42090 Konya, Turkey; [Uguz, Harun] Selcuk Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Konya, Turkey; [Cay, Tayfun] Selcuk Univ, Dept Geomat Engn, Konya, Turkey";Hakli, H (corresponding author), Necmettin Erbakan Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-42090 Konya, Turkey.;hhakli@konya.edu.tr;;;"Scientific Research Projects of Necmettin Erbakan and Selcuk Universities; Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK) [114Y608]";"Scientific Research Projects of Necmettin Erbakan and Selcuk Universities; Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), Grant/Award Number: 114Y608";;47;4;4;1;7;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0266-4720;1468-0394;;EXPERT SYST;Expert Syst.;DEC;2018;35;6;;;;;;;e12308;10.1111/exsy.12308;;;17;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;HD2BS;WOS:000452316700005;;;;;2021-02-18;

Using active controllers, a structure can adaptively adjust its behaviour during dynamic loads. Such structures with self-modifying capabilities are referred to as intelligent or smart structures. Smart structure technology has the potential to be a game changer in the structural engineering field. It promises to have enormous consequences in terms of preventing loss of life and damage to structure and their content especially for large structures with hundreds or thousands of components. A key element in successful implementation of smart active control technology is an effective control algorithm to compute the magnitudes of actual forces to be applied to the structure. In this paper, an overview of main active control methodologies for vibration control of smart civil and mechanical structures subjected to external dynamic loads is presented. The advantages and the disadvantages of different control algorithms are discussed. Finally, new trends in control algorithm research are pointed out including multiparadigm strategies, decentralized control, application of deep neural network machine learning techniques, control design for sustainability, and unification of the two fields of structural health monitoring and vibration control.;"[Li, Zhijun] Xian Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Architecture Engn, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Adeli, Hojjat] Ohio State Univ, 470 Hitchcock Hall,2070 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43220 USA";Adeli, H (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, 470 Hitchcock Hall,2070 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43220 USA.;adeli.1@osu.edu;adeli, hojjat/D-1430-2010;adeli, hojjat/0000-0001-5718-1453;"President Foundation of Xi'an Technological University [XAGDXJJ0919]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51678480]";"President Foundation of Xi'an Technological University, Grant/Award Number: XAGDXJJ0919; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 51678480";;189;3;3;13;57;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0266-4720;1468-0394;;EXPERT SYST;Expert Syst.;DEC;2018;35;6;;;;;;;e12354;10.1111/exsy.12354;;;20;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";Computer Science;HD2BS;WOS:000452316700012;;;;;2021-02-18;

The present study is an attempt to develop an ES in which inference attributes are formed on the basis of automated discovery of tacit knowledge. The structure of the KA module provides an opportunity to discover new knowledge from the cognitive representations of domain models. The algorithmic processing mechanism consists of three blocks: cluster analysis, influence analysis, and modelling of the equivalent graph. In the proposed expert system based on effective controls, a method of finding influences that highlights the main characteristics of the system is presented. These parameters are used as attributes for the further development of the rule base, expertise, or independent use in decision-making. A qualitative decrease in user subjectivity is achieved using this algorithm and through elimination of the knowledge engineer from the cycle of KA, which transforms it into a discovery knowledge cycle.

To defeat, we propose Graph Mining for Metamorphic Malware Detection (G3MD), an intelligent system for static detection of metamorphic malwares. G3MD demonstrates one of the many aspects of what the current generation of machine-learning techniques and expert systems can do. It extends what is known about practical application of machine-learning techniques in the field of information security. It is intended to alleviate the burden of human experts and underlying costs. The novelty of G3MD is to apply graph mining on the opcode graphs of a metamorphic family of malwares to extract the frequent sub-graphs, so called micro signatures. Based on these sub-graphs, a classifier is trained to distinguish between a benign file and a metamorphic malware. We conducted experiments on four families of metamorphic malwares common in previous studies, namely Next Generation Virus Generation Kit (NGVCK), Second Generation Virus Generator (G2), and Mass Produced Code Generation Kit (MPCGEN) viruses and Metamorphic Worm (MWOR) worms. The precision (over 99% in most cases) of metamorphic malware detection by the proposed approach corroborates its effectiveness over other existing approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Emotion recognition from these physiological signals is a challenging problem with interesting applications such as developing wearable assistive devices and smart human-computer interfaces. This paper presents an automated method for emotion classification in children using electro-dermal activity (EDA) signals. The time-frequency analysis of the acquired raw EDAs provides a feature space based on which different emotions can be recognized. To this end, the complex Morlet (C-Morlet) wavelet function is applied on the recorded EDA signals. The dataset used in this paper includes a set of multimodal recordings of social and communicative behavior as well as EDA recordings of 100 children younger than 30 months old. The dataset is annotated by two experts to extract the time sequence corresponding to three main emotions including Joy, Boredom, and Acceptance. The annotation process is performed considering the synchronicity between the children's facial expressions and the EDA time sequences. Various experiments are conducted on the annotated EDA signals to classify emotions using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The quantitative results show that the emotion classification performance remarkably improves compared to other methods when the proposed wavelet-based features are used. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we explore the possibility to exploit information recorded noninvasively from the human cortex to develop a brain-computer interface (BCI) able to estimate brain workload and the mental efforts during a cognitive task. The EEG-based workload classifier presented in this paper combines a power spectral density (PSD) analysis and a statistical criterion. The proposed classifier is applied in the context of distance education and online course platform through two experimental protocols. The first one proposes solving a set of matrices products using pen and paper, while the second one proposes answering problems of logic mathematics on a computer-based learning environment. Experimental results show that the averaged accuracy of distinguishing changes in the theta [4-7Hz] (theta) band is 79%. For the alpha band [8-11 Hz] (alpha) the averaged accuracy reached 78%. Based on this classifier, we demonstrate that and theta powers in central, and posterior sites decrease with the increase in difficulty level of the cognitive task. The accuracy of correct decisions obtained from our results are significantly enhanced while comparing our investigation to some similar works from literature. In the realm of intelligent expert systems, our work results represent a first step to an implementation of an intelligent system for the evaluation of reeducative therapies to be used in physiotherapy centers for children with cognitive disorders as it is the case for Cerebral Palsy.

Information emanating from these platforms can significantly affect, or be affected by, changes in the stock market. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop a financial expert system that incorporates these features to predict short term stock prices. Our expert system is comprised of two main modules: a knowledge base and an artificial intelligence (AI) platform. The knowledge base for our expert system captures: (a) historical stock prices; (b) several well-known technical indicators; (c) counts and sentiment scores of published news articles for a given stock; (d) trends in Google searches for the given stock ticker; and (e) number of unique visitors for pertinent Wikipedia pages. Once the data is collected, we use a structured approach for data preparation. Then, the AI platform trains four machine learning ensemble methods: (a) a neural network regression ensemble; (b) a support vector regression ensemble; (c) a boosted regression tree; and (d) a random forest regression. In the cross-validation phase, the AI platform picks the best ensemble for a given stock. To evaluate the efficacy of our expert system, we first present a case study based on the Citi Group stock ($C) with data collected from 01/01/2013 - 12/31/2016. We show the expert system can predict the 1-day ahead $C stock price with a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) <= 1.50% and the 1-10 day ahead with a MAPE <= 1.89%, which is better than the reported results in the literature. We show that the use of features extracted from online sources does not substitute the traditional financial metrics, but rather supplements them to improve upon the prediction performance of machine learning based methods. To highlight the utility and generalizability of our expert system, we predict the 1-day ahead price of 19 additional stocks from different industries, volatilities and growth patterns. We report an overall mean for the MAPE statistic of 1.07% across our five different machine learning models, including a MAPE of under 0.75% for 18 of the 19 stocks for the best ensemble (boosted regression tree).

More often than not, one type of MRI image is insufficient to provide the complete information about a pathological tissue or a visual object from the image. As a result, radiology experts often combine multisequence images of a patient to verify the location, extension, prognosis and diagnosis of an object. There are mainly two challenges in medical image segmentation. One is ambiguous boundary that appears between an object and its neighboring region, and the other is intensity inhomogeneity that appears within a region. Thus, this paper focuses on how to effectively segment multisequence medical images despite these two main challenges. This paper proposes a multi-phase approach that integrates both data and domain knowledge into multisequence MR image segmentation. This study divides the segmentation approach into three phases, which are (i) information modeling, (ii), information fusion, and (iii) visual object extraction. In the first phase, random walks algorithm is modified and used to model the information of an image. Because of the ambiguous boundary and intensity inhomogeneity that appear within an image, extra terms related to homogeneity- and object feature-based components are added into the weighting function of random walks algorithm. In the second phase, weighted averaging method is used to fuse information from the image sequences. Both data information of an image as well as user knowledge are integrated to determine the weights of each sequence for fusion. In the final phase, the concept of information theoretic rough sets (ITRS) is utilized to address the issue of ambiguous boundary that may appear between the visual object and its background for object extraction. The proposed approach is tested on MICCAI brain tumor dataset to extract brain tumor and its performance is compared with other established methods. The experiments show promising results, with an average DICE accuracy of 0.7 and 0.63 for high- and low-grade tumor, respectively. As compared to the other fully- and semi-automatic methods that require training and careful initialization processes, the proposed approach is able to extract the brain tumor with prior knowledge about the image.

The technique is incorporated as part of an intelligent expert system that can aid medical practitioners making diagnostic decisions. Analysis of volumetric images, slice by slice, is cumbersome and inefficient. Hence, 3D-LESH is designed to compute a histogram-based feature set from a local energy map, calculated using a phase congruency (PC) measure of volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans in 3D space. 3D-LESH features are invariant to contrast intensity variations within different slices of the MRI scan and are thus suitable for medical image analysis. The contribution of this article is manifold. First, we formulate a novel 3D-LESH feature extraction technique for 3D medical images to analyse volumetric images. Further, the proposed 3D-LESH algorithmic, for the first time, applied to medical MRI images. The final contribution is the design of an intelligent clinical decision support system (CDSS) as a multi-stage approach, combining novel 3D-LESH feature extraction with machine learning classifiers, to detect cancer from breast MRI scans. The proposed system applies contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalisation (CLAHE) to the MRI images before extracting 3D-LESH features. Furthermore, a selected subset of these features is fed into a machine-learning classifier, namely, a support vector machine (SVM), an extreme learning machine (ELM) or an echo state network (ESN) classifier, to detect abnormalities and distinguish between different stages of abnormality. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique by its application to benchmark breast cancer MRI images. The results indicate high-performance accuracy of the proposed system (98%+/- 0.0050, with an area under a receiver operating charactertistic curve value of 0.9900 +/- 0.0050) with multiple classifiers. When compared with the state-of-the-art wavelet-based feature extraction technique, statistical analysis provides conclusive evidence of the significance of our proposed 3D-LESH algorithm.

To this end, we need a holistic view on the food production beyond the classical farm to fork principle and consider developments in- and outside the food chain. Commodity flows and prices are considered as relevant drivers for the emergence of food safety and fraud issues. To conveniently obtain information on these drivers and to monitor their changes, we developed a tool to analyze the volume, origin and price of foods imported to Germany, based on data of the German Foreign Trade Statistic. The ISAR-Tool (Import Screening for the Anticipation of Food Risks) facilitates a descriptive analysis of the import data of about 2400 different food items imported from 220 countries and an automated analysis of the data for a systematic detection of unexpected changes in import volumes and prices. For the automated approach, time series analyses using SARIMA and ETS models are applied and data points outside the model based 99% prediction intervals are considered as potentially relevant changes. Monthly, more than 2000 of such changes are detected, leaving us with the challenging task of their evaluation for food safety and food fraud. To deal with the vast amount of results, of which the great majority cannot be linked to food safety or fraud issues, we implemented prioritization routines, and the 200 most critical results are considered for further expert evaluation. Despite remaining challenges in the performed evaluation process of the automated analysis, the described approach facilitates already at this stage an improved identification of food safety and food fraud hazards and the implementation of more targeted food safety controls, as shown in this paper. Our most prominent example of an identified food fraud and food safety risk was the detection of massive adulterations of hazelnut products with almonds and cashews, which were associated to the observed all-time high in hazelnut prices. Based on our findings, we conclude that the ISAR-Tool and the described analyses of commodity flows and prices can be important elements in the anticipation of risks and enable an enhanced consumer protection.;"[Verhaelen, K.; Mueller, B.; Celik, B.

Precise terminology facilitates communication among individuals, clinicians, academics and researchers. To arrive at definitions, the concepts underlying basic scientific vocabularies must be universally acceptable to all users. This is not always easy. Tarachow cautioned in 1965 about how contractions and abbreviations, ... eliminated practically all the associations connected with the original title and did not at all have the evocative impact of the complete word or title [1] (Tarachow, 1965). Clinical medicine has designed and used with some success disease-diagnosis based classification systems. Forensic science, as does clinical medicine, relies on cognitive processes for its mission to achieve expert accuracy. Both fields are vulnerable to biases and errors in cognition, more so when no terminology standards exist. It is time to develop a nomenclature system in the field of cognitive bias and cognitive errors. This system should build transdisciplinary understanding, at least during expertise-based undertakings in forensic and clinical sciences. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The legal fact finder is thus confronted with variability in the quality, structure, and content of forensic medical reports. We sought to define and categorize the scope, methods, and practices that fall under the description of forensic medicine, the various issues encountered in current forensic medical practice, and the potential role of evidence-based practice in forensic medicine. We searched electronic databases and reviewed relevant articles, as well as conducting personal correspondences with forensic medical practitioners around the world, to obtain a description of current forensic medical practice. The terms forensic medicine, legal medicine, medical jurisprudence, medico-legal services, forensic pathology, and clinical forensic medicine are used with mixed interpretations in different countries. The systems and services rendered are not uniform either. The methods used by forensic medical practitioners are not always evidence-based, or based on standardized methods, and vary greatly between experts and centers. There are also no universally accepted guidelines to prepare a standard and admissible report. The lack of a uniform system in forensic medicine creates difficulties in assessing the development and performance of forensic medicine as a distinct discipline. To prepare evidence-based forensic medical reports, generally accepted guidelines are necessary.;"[Meilia, Putri Dianita Ika; Freeman, Michael D.; Zeegers, Maurice P.] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Care & Publ Hlth Res Inst CAPHRI, Univ Singel 40, NL-6229 ER Maastricht, Netherlands; [Herkutanto] Univ Indonesia, Fac Med, Dept Forens Med & Medicolegal Studies, Jl Salemba Raya 4, Salemba 10430, Jakarta Pusat, Indonesia";Meilia, PDI (corresponding author), Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Care & Publ Hlth Res Inst CAPHRI, Univ Singel 40, NL-6229 ER Maastricht, Netherlands.;p.meilia@maastrichtuniversity.nl;MEILIA, PUTRI DIANITA IKA/AAK-1622-2020;"MEILIA, PUTRI DIANITA IKA/0000-0003-3699-664X; Zeegers, Maurice/0000-0002-2387-083X";Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP);This work was supported by the Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) scholarship body as part of a Doctoral Scholarship Program.;;110;5;5;0;4;HUMANA PRESS INC;TOTOWA;999 RIVERVIEW DRIVE SUITE 208, TOTOWA, NJ 07512 USA;1547-769X;1556-2891;;FORENSIC SCI MED PAT;Forensic Sci.

Guidelines recommend testing patients by pH monitoring when they are on or off acid-suppressive therapies based on pretest probability of reflux, determined by expert consensus. However, it is not clear what constitutes a low or high pretest probability of reflux in these patients. We aimed to develop a model that clinicians can use at bedside to estimate pretest probability of abnormal reflux. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 471 adult patients with refractory heartburn (n = 214) or suspected EER symptoms (n = 257) who underwent endoscopy with wireless pH monitoring while they were off acid-suppressive treatment and assigned them to groups based on symptoms at presentation (discovery cohort). Using data from the discovery cohort, we performed proportional odds ordinal logistic regression to select factors (easy to obtain demographic criteria and clinical symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, asthma, cough, and hoarseness) associated with esophageal exposure to acid. We validated our findings in a cohort of 118 patients with the same features from 2 separate tertiary care centers (62% women; median age 59 years; 62% with cough as presenting symptom). RESULTS: Abnormal pH (>5.5% of time spent at pH <4) was found in 56% of patients with heartburn and 63% of patients with EER (P=.15). Within EER groups, abnormal pH was detected in a significantly larger proportion (80%) of patients with asthma compared with patients with cough (60%) or hoarseness (51%; P<.01). Factors significantly associated with abnormal pH in patients with heartburn were presence of hiatal hernia and body mass index >25 kg/m(2). In patients with EER, the risk of reflux was independently associated with the presence of concomitant heartburn (odds ratio [OR] 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-3.1), body mass index >25 kg/m(2) (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.5-3.1), asthma (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.2-3.5), and presence of hiatal hernia (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.2-3.1). When we used these factors to create a scoring system, we found that a score of <= 2 excluded patients with moderate to severe reflux, with a negative predictive value of 80% in the discovery cohort and a negative predictive value of 85% in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: We developed a clinical model to estimate pretest probability of abnormal pH in patients who were failed by proton pump inhibitor therapy. This system can help guide clinicians at bedside in determining the most appropriate diagnostic test in this challenging group of patients.";"[Patel, Dhyanesh A.; Choksi, Yash A.; Higginbotham, Tina; Vaezi, Michael F.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Div Gastroenterol Hepatol & Nutr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Slaughter, James C.] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Biostat, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Garrett, C.

It was also suggested that the conception of livability should be extended to embrace the concerns associated with the sustainability. However, planning frameworks or assessment patterns that address the dynamics of urban planning and demand for transportation deploying are relatively rare; there also few public policies in related research fields have discussed the effects of the changes in various assessment indicators over time. Furthermore, following the rising advancements in social communication and computer technologies in modern society, the data collection, storage, and processing capabilities of people have improved substantially. And, the emergence of big data or extendible open data facilitates analysis and prediction availability, and enabled people to find immediate solutions to numerous dilemmas encountered. Therefore, based on the aforementioned intention, treating the city as a dynamic process with the trying of introducing the big data or extendible open data for facilitating urban sustainability and livability is undoubtedly worth to explore in further. The present study intends to initially examine the application of big data in sustainable and livable transportation strategies in Taipei City, Taiwan. Firstly, we investigate previous research on transportation sustain ability in various countries to generalize our preliminary list of transportation sustainability indices that satisfy the principles of livable cities. And, key indices were then selected through the Fuzzy Delphi Method by administering a questionnaire to six experts from industrial, governmental, and academic sectors respectively. The research results were applied to develop decision-making strategies for responding to the environmental dynamics of Taipei City's transportation infrastructure system by using the analytic network process combined with a data-mining technique. Thus, big data pertaining to urban transportation were analyzed to predict the future dynamic trends of the key indices and prioritize the sustainable transportation strategies for a livable city under dynamic temporal and spatial changes. Ultimately, the policy implications of this study can not only offer a solution for current needs related to urban planning but also serve as a more transparent decision-making or well selection basis for developing sustainable and livable urban life in near future.";"[Wey, Wann-Ming; Huang, Jhong-You] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Real Estate & Built Environm, 151 Univ Rd, New Taipei 23741, Taiwan";Wey, WM (corresponding author), Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Real Estate & Built Environm, 151 Univ Rd, New Taipei 23741, Taiwan.;"wmwey@mail.ntpu.edu.tw; jhongyouhuang@gmail.com";Babariya, Dheeraj/G-8663-2019;;Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [104-2410-H-305-077-MY3, 106-2410-H-305-057-MY3, 107-NTPU_A-HE-143-001];The authors would like to thank anonymous referees and the Editor of the journal for constructive comments and suggestions.

Reviews looking at evaluation tools for patient engagement in individual decision making do exist, but no similar articles in research and health systems have been published. Objective: Systematically review and appraise evaluation tools for patient and public engagement in research and health system decision making. Methods: We searched literature published between January 1980 and February 2016. Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL and PsycINFO) were consulted, as well as grey literature obtained through Google, subject-matter experts, social media and engagement organization websites. Two independent reviewers appraised the evaluation tools based on 4 assessment criteria: scientific rigour, patient and public perspective, comprehensiveness and usability. Results: In total, 10 663 unique references were identified, 27 were included. Most of these tools were developed in the last decade and were designed to support improvement of engagement activities. Only 11% of tools were explicitly based on a literature review, and just 7% were tested for reliability. Patients and members of the public were involved in designing 56% of the tools, mainly in the piloting stage, and 18.5% of tools were designed to report evaluation results to patients and the public. Conclusion: A growing number of evaluation tools are available to support patient and public engagement in research and health system decision making. However, the scientific rigour with which such evaluation tools are developed could be improved, as well as the level of patient and public engagement in their design and reporting.;"[Boivin, Antoine] Univ Montreal Hosp Res Ctr CRCHUM, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Boivin, Antoine] Univ Montreal, Dept Family Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Boivin, Antoine; L'Esperance, Audrey; Gauvin, Francois-Pierre; Dumez, Vincent] CEPPP, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Boivin, Antoine; Lehoux, Pascale] Univ Montreal, Ecole Sante Publ, Dept Hlth Management Evaluat & Policy, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Gauvin, Francois-Pierre] McMaster Univ, McMaster Hlth Forum, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Dumez, Vincent] Univ Montreal, Fac Med, Direct Collaborat & Partenariat Patient, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Macaulay, Ann C.] McGill Univ, Dept Family Med, Participatory Res McGill, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Abelson, Julia] McMaster Univ, CHEPA, Hamilton, ON, Canada";Boivin, A (corresponding author), Univ Montreal Hosp Res Ctr CRCHUM, Ctr Excellence Patient & Publ Partnership, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;antoine.boivin@umontreal.ca;"L'Esperance, Audrey/M-6445-2019; Lehoux, Pascale/Q-6370-2019";"Lehoux, Pascale/0000-0001-9482-1800; Boivin, Antoine/0000-0001-7824-8602";"SUPPORT Unit (Support for People and Patient-Oriented Research and Trials) of British Columbia; SUPPORT Unit (Support for People and Patient-Oriented Research and Trials) of Alberta; SUPPORT Unit (Support for People and Patient-Oriented Research and Trials) of Saskatchewan; SUPPORT Unit (Support for People and Patient-Oriented Research and Trials) of Manitoba; SUPPORT Unit (Support for People and Patient-Oriented Research and Trials) of Ontario; SUPPORT Unit (Support for People and Patient-Oriented Research and Trials) of Quebec; SUPPORT Unit (Support for People and Patient-Oriented Research and Trials) of Maritime; SUPPORT Unit (Support for People and Patient-Oriented Research and Trials) of Newfoundland and Labrador; CIHR Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR)Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Canada Research Chair in Patient and Public Partnership";"SUPPORT Units (Support for People and Patient-Oriented Research and Trials) of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Maritime, Newfoundland and Labrador, Grant/Award Number: NA; CIHR Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR); Canada Research Chair in Patient and Public Partnership";;37;30;30;1;9;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1369-6513;1369-7625;;HEALTH EXPECT;Health Expect.;DEC;2018;21;6;;;;;1075;1084;;10.1111/hex.12804;;;10;"Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health";"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health";HB3KO;WOS:000450950200016;30062858;DOAJ Gold, Green Published;;;2021-02-18;

The state-of-the-art approach consists of coupling one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic models. However, at present such coupled 1D/2D models are mostly commercial and complex to build and run. The present study has proposed a new simple approach for modeling urban flooding by coupling Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) and LISFLOOD-FP, two widely used freewares with relatively simple components. The coupled model was firstly applied to the Shiqiao Creek District in Dongguan City, South China, and verified against four major historical floods. The testing results demonstrate the capability of the coupled model in predicting urban flooding. The successful coupling of SWMM and LISFLOOD-FP offers another simple, practical approach for urban flooding estimation, which can be readily used by non-expert users or those who do not have access to commercial modules.;"[Wu, Xushu; Guo, Shenglian] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xushu; Wang, Zhaoli; Lai, Chengguang] South China Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Transportat, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhaoli; Lai, Chengguang] South China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xiaohong] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Water Resources & Environm Res, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China";"Wang, ZL (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Transportat, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Wang, ZL (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Subtrop Bldg Sci, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China.";wangzhl@scut.edu.cn;;;"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51579105, 51210013, 51209095]; Water Resource Science and Technology Innovation Program of Guangdong Province; Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou City [201707010072]";"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51579105, 51210013, 51209095); the Water Resource Science and Technology Innovation Program of Guangdong Province (2016-25); and the Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou City (201707010072).";;31;7;7;2;44;IWA PUBLISHING;LONDON;ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND;0029-1277;2224-7955;;HYDROL RES;Hydrol.

For example, some individuals might form a small alliance with the aim to refuse attempts to modify their preferences or even to move them against consensus to foster the alliance's own interests. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on a self-management mechanism for noncooperative behaviors in large-scale CRPs (LCRPs). In the proposed consensus reaching framework, experts are classified into different subgroups using a clustering method, and experts provide their evaluation information, i.e., the multicriteria mutual evaluation matrices (MCMEMs), regarding the subgroups based on subgroups' performance (e.g., professional skills, cooperation, and fairness). The subgroups' weights are dynamically generated from the MCMEMs, which are in turn employed to update the individual experts' weights. This self-management mechanism in the LCRP allows penalizing the weights of the experts with noncooperative behaviors. Detailed simulation experiments and comparison analysis are presented to verify the validity of the proposed framework for managing noncooperative behaviors in the LCRP.;"[Dong, Yucheng; Zhao, Sihai] Sichuan Univ, Business Sch, Chengdu 610065, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hengjie] Hohai Univ, Business Sch, Nanjing 211100, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chiclana, Francisco] De Montfort Univ, Ctr Computat Intelligence, Fac Technol, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England; [Herrera-Viedma, Enrique] Univ Granada, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Granada 18010, Spain; [Herrera-Viedma, Enrique] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Fac Engn, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia";"Zhang, HJ (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Business Sch, Nanjing 211100, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Herrera-Viedma, E (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Granada 18010, Spain.; Herrera-Viedma, E (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Fac Engn, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.";"ycdong@scu.edu.cn; shzhao@stu.scu.edu.cn; hengjiezhang@126.com; chi-clana@dmu.ac.uk; viedma@decsai.ugr.es";"Zhang, Hengjie/I-1729-2017; Dong, Yucheng/J-1668-2017; Chiclana, Francisco/B-9031-2008; Herrera-Viedma, Enrique/C-2704-2008";"Zhang, Hengjie/0000-0002-5488-9082; Dong, Yucheng/0000-0002-0028-6796; Chiclana, Francisco/0000-0002-3952-4210; Herrera-Viedma, Enrique/0000-0002-7922-4984";"NSF of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71571124]; Sichuan UniversitySichuan University [sksyl201705]; FEDER fundsEuropean Union (EU) [TIN2013-40658-P, TIN2016-75850-R]; Andalusian Excellence Project [TIC-5991]";This work was supported by the NSF of China under Grant 71571124, by Sichuan University under Grant sksyl201705, by the FEDER funds under Grant TIN2013-40658-P and Grant TIN2016-75850-R, and by the Andalusian Excellence Project under Grant TIC-5991.;;71;81;84;11;101;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;1063-6706;1941-0034;;IEEE T FUZZY SYST;IEEE Trans.

This process is done for three major reasons: 1) to determine the actual sensory differences between coffee samples; 2) to describe the flavors of the samples; and 3) to determine preference of product. In totality, cupping targets the measurement of the coffee's quality, which is expressed with a final numerical score. When cupping, the expert judge writes down the individual components' scores and ranks their intensities for reference. Fuzzy logic has been employed for sensory evaluation of chhana podo (a baked dairy product), also for mango pulp and litchi juice. Moreover, a similar work exists only to train the Honduran Coffee Cuppers. This paper introduces a fuzzy expert system, AI Cupper offering an intuitive way for representing the judge's knowledge by linguistically modeling his perception of the coffee attributes through sensorial evaluation. It is capable of training cuppers when evaluating coffees from several countries and even has the capacity to learn as cupping data flows through it.

Accurate viability assessment prior to transplantation could minimize organ discard. Rapid and accurate evaluation of intra-operative donor kidney biopsies is essential for determining which kidneys are eligible for transplantation. The criterion for accepting or rejecting donor kidneys relies heavily on pathologist determination of the percent of glomeruli (determined from a frozen section) that are normal and sclerotic. This percentage is a critical measurement that correlates with transplant outcome. Inter- and intra-observer variability in donor biopsy evaluation is, however, significant. An automated method for determination of percent global glomerulosclerosis could prove useful in decreasing evaluation variability, increasing throughput, and easing the burden on pathologists. Here, we describe the development of a deep learning model that identifies and classifies non-sclerosed and sclerosed glomeruli in whole-slide images of donor kidney frozen section biopsies. This model extends a convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on a large database of digital images. The extended model, when trained on just 48whole slide images, exhibits slide-level evaluation performance on par with expert renal pathologists. Encouragingly, the model's performance is robust to slide preparation artifacts associated with frozen section preparation. The model substantially outperforms a model trained on image patches of isolated glomeruli, in terms of both accuracy and speed. The methodology overcomes the technical challenge of applying a pretrained CNN bottleneck model to whole-slide image classification. The traditional patch-based approach, while exhibiting deceptively good performance classifying isolated patches, does not translate successfully to whole-slide image segmentation in this setting. As the first model reported that identifies and classifies normal and sclerotic glomeruli in frozen kidney sections, and thus the first model reported in the literature relevant to kidney transplantation, it may become an essential part of donor kidney biopsy evaluation in the clinical setting.;"[Marsh, Jon N.; Swamidass, S.

Spark Streaming as an emerging system is developed to process real time stream data analytics by using micro-batch approach. The unified programming model of Spark Steaming leads to some unique benefits over other traditional streaming systems, such as fast recovery from failures, better load balancing and resource usage. It treats the continuous stream as a series of micro-batches of data and continuously process these micro-batch jobs. However, efficient scheduling of micro-batch jobs to achieve high throughput and low latency is very challenging due to the complex data dependency and dynamism inherent in streaming workloads. In this paper, we propose A-scheduler, an adaptive scheduling approach that dynamically schedules parallel micro-batch jobs in Spark Streaming and automatically adjusts scheduling parameters to improve performance and resource efficiency. Specifically, A-scheduler dynamically schedules multiple jobs concurrently using different policies based on their data dependencies and automatically adjusts the level of job parallelism and resource shares among jobs based on workload properties. Furthermore, we integrate dynamic batching technique with A-Scheduler to further improve the overall performance of the customized Spark Streaming system. It relies on an expert fuzzy control mechanism to dynamically adjust the length of each batch interval in response to time-varying streaming workload and system processing rate. We implemented A-scheduler and evaluated it with a real-time security event processing workload. Our experimental results show that A-scheduler with dynamic batching can reduce end-to-end latency by 38 percent and meanwhile improve workload throughput and energy efficiency by 23 and 15 percent, respectively, compared to the default Spark Streaming scheduler.;"[Cheng, Dazhao; Wang, Yu] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Comp Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Zhou, Xiaobo] Univ Colorado, Dept Comp Sci, Colorado Springs, CO 80918 USA; [Jiang, Changjun] Tongji Univ, Key Lab Embedded Syst & Serv Comp, Shanghai 200000, Peoples R China";Cheng, DZ (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Comp Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.;"dazhao.cheng@uncc.edu; xzhou@uccs.edu; yu.wang@uncc.edu; cjjiang@tongji.edu.cn";Wang, Yu/A-7615-2009;Wang, Yu/0000-0003-3511-0288;University of North Carolina at Charlotte;This research was supported by the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.;;26;4;4;3;17;IEEE COMPUTER SOC;LOS ALAMITOS;10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA;1045-9219;1558-2183;;IEEE T PARALL DISTR;IEEE Trans.

Pap smear is a simple cytology test for the detection of cancer in its early stages. To obtain the best results from the Pap smear, expert pathologist are required. Availability of pathologist in India is far below the required numbers, especially in rural parts. In this paper, multiple texture-based features are introduced for the extraction of relevant and informative features from single-cell images. First-order histogram, GLCM, LBP, Laws, and DWT are used for texture feature extraction. These methods help to recognise the contour of the nucleus and cytoplasm. ANN and SVM are used to classify the single-cell images either normal or cancerous based on the trained features. ANN and SVM are used on every single feature as well as on the combination of all features. Best results are obtained with a combination of all features. The system is evaluated on generated dataset MNITJ, containing 330 single cervical cell images and also on publicly available benchmark Herlev data set. Experimental results show that the proposed texture-based features give significantly better results in cervical cancer detection when compared with state of the art shape-based features regarding accuracy.;"[Arya, Mithlesh; Mittal, Namita; Singh, Girdhari] Malaviya Natl Inst Technol, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, JLN Marg, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India";Arya, M (corresponding author), Malaviya Natl Inst Technol, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, JLN Marg, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.;mithlesharya@gmail.com;Mittal, Namita/AAL-3336-2020;"Mittal, Namita/0000-0001-6886-9974; Singh, Girdhari/0000-0003-3971-4687";;;;42;8;8;1;20;INST ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY-IET;HERTFORD;MICHAEL FARADAY HOUSE SIX HILLS WAY STEVENAGE, HERTFORD SG1 2AY, ENGLAND;1751-9632;1751-9640;;IET COMPUT VIS;IET Comput.

The aim of the present study was to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate a new wearable device (Learn Inspire Free Entertain = L.I.F.E.) by embedding in a compression shirt a 12-lead ECG system and 5 respiratory sensors. Methods: Thirty cardiorespiratory patients and ten healthy subjects were studied for 24 h during their usual life activities. In 8 healthy subjects, simultaneous measurements of the device and of an ergo-spirometer were performed during different levels of ventilation in five different body positions. The quality of ECG signals in terms of measurability of heart rate, P wave, QRS complex and ST segment, was analyzed by four expert cardiologists/ respiratory physiologists using an arbitrary 1-5 scale. The sum of the respiratory signals was used to calculate the respiratory rate, inspiratory time and relative changes of tidal volume. These parameters were compared to ergo-spirometer measurements. Results: Median quality value was >3 for heart rate, QRS complex, ST segment and P wave (except in L3, aVL, aVF, V1 and V2 leads). Median quality of respiratory traces was >4 in patients and between 3 and 4 in healthy subjects. The respiratory monitoring of respiratory rate and inspiratory time was accurate in all body positions. Tidal volumes were underestimated due to a high level of ventilation.

Prescription review and pharmacist interventions are a fundamental part of hospital clinical pharmacy activities. In a context of restricted financial resources, proving the economic and clinical impact of this activity seems necessary. Objective The aim of this study was to assess the clinical impact on patient outcomes and economic benefit of prescription review by pharmacists. Setting 1624-bed tertiary French university teaching hospital. Method Prospective single center study evaluating prescriptions for which a pharmacist intervention was issued over a 6-month period. The clinical impact of every pharmacist intervention was evaluated by a multidisciplinary experts committee. Economic benefit was evaluated from the public health care system spending standpoint. Main outcome measures Number of avoided hospitalization days and associated public health care system cost-avoidance. Results Prescription review and interventions by pharmacists prevented 73 intensive care unit hospitalization days, 74 continuous monitoring unit hospitalization days and 66 days of conventional hospitalization. (sic)252,294.00 in public health expenditure were thus prevented. For every Euro invested in the prescription review activity, (sic)5.09 of public health spending were potentially saved. Conclusion Our study shows that prescription review and clinical pharmacists' interventions had an impact on clinical outcomes which translated into prevented hospitalization days. Prescription optimization through pharmacist interventions allows significant health care cost savings which makes this service highly efficient.;"[Jourdan, Jean-Pierre; Muzard, Alexandra; Goyer, Isabelle; Breuil, Cecile] Caen CHU, Dept Pharm, F-14000 Caen, France; [Jourdan, Jean-Pierre] Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, Ctr Etud & Rech Medicament Normandie, CERMN, F-14000 Caen, France; [Ollivier, Yann] Caen UHC, Dept Internal Med, F-14000 Caen, France; [Oulkhouir, Youssef] Caen UHC, Dept Chest Med, F-14000 Caen, France; [Henri, Patrick] Caen UHC, Renal Dis Teaching Ctr, F-14000 Caen, France; [Parienti, Jean-Jacques] Caen UHC, Clin Res & Innovat Div, F-14000 Caen, France";"Jourdan, JP (corresponding author), Caen CHU, Dept Pharm, F-14000 Caen, France.; Jourdan, JP (corresponding author), Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, Ctr Etud & Rech Medicament Normandie, CERMN, F-14000 Caen, France.";jourdan-jp@chu-caen.fr;"JOURDAN, Jean-Pierre/Y-2387-2019; Parienti, Jean-Jacques/AAD-1701-2021; JOURDAN, Jean-Pierre/ABI-6132-2020";"Parienti, Jean-Jacques/0000-0002-4774-5590; JOURDAN, Jean-Pierre/0000-0002-0553-9705";;;;29;6;6;1;5;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;2210-7703;2210-7711;;INT J CLIN PHARM-NET;Int.

Their consideration in some of the main global frameworks such as the IPCC report or the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction has raised additional attention. However, these approaches are still more associated with rural than urban areas, although many urban areas face a high risk of natural hazards and the benefits of ecosystem-based measures to reduce it have already been proven in different cities. A successful implementation of ecosystem-based approaches in urban areas is highly complex. Using the city of Rio de Janeiro as case study, we first examine on the municipality level the responsibilities of the different institutions involved in landslide risk reduction and their technical and organizational interfaces. In a second step we zoom into two marginal settlements to determine whether ecosystem-based measures for landslide risk reduction already exist and assess the potential to either implement or further increase their application. These so-called favelas are often constructed on or beneath steep and degraded slopes prone to landslides. Landslides are mainly triggered by heavy rainfall events which are likely to increase in the future due to the impacts of global climate change. Activities to reduce landslide risk are distributed between many different actors, such as civil defense, geological survey, urban planning, and environmental management, and the measures taken are predominantly engineered approaches with a focus on preparedness and response. The urban reforestation program which could provide additional ecosystem benefits is not yet aligned enough with risk reduction and faces several challenges. In addition, the consideration of informal settings in formal urban planning and management strategies can still be improved. Based on quantitative and qualitative data from interviews and secondary sources, site visits, and expert interviews with representatives from public authorities and other stakeholders, the research assesses the individual institutional approaches as well as the overall urban governance system with regard to disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. The potential governance challenges for fostering ecosystem-based approaches are analyzed and clustered to provide an insight on paths that could facilitate the future consideration of Eco-DRR/EbA in Rio de Janeiro and beyond.;"[Sandholz, Simone] United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, UN Campus,Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Lange, Wolfram] Humboldt Univ, Ctr Rural Dev SLE, Hessische Str 1-2, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Nehren, Udo] TH Koln Univ Appl Sci, Inst Technol & Resources Management Trop & Subtro, Betzdorfer Str 2, D-50679 Cologne, Germany";Sandholz, S (corresponding author), United Nations Univ, Inst Environm & Human Secur UNU EHS, UN Campus,Pl Vereinten Nationen 1, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.;"sandholz@ehs.unu.edu; w.lange@gmx.net; udo.nehren@th-koeln.de";;Nehren, Udo/0000-0001-6236-3542;Lincoln Institute of Land Policy;The research presented here was carried out with financial support of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy.;;83;5;5;1;26;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;2212-4209;;;INT J DISAST RISK RE;Int.

During torrefaction, operating conditions were very important. Changes in the reactor temperature and the reactor residence times had large influences on product yields. With increasing torrefaction temperature, the volatile matter and oxygen content of biomass decreased, while fixed carbon content and heating value greatly increased. Design-Expert software package was used for the design of experiments (DOE) and to carry out the statistical analysis according to the experimental results. The optimum biocoal yield of 56.59%, energy yield of 47.49%, higher heating value of 26 761.9 kJ/kg, hardgrove grindability index of 91.76, H/C ratio of 0.099, and O/C ratio of 0.312 were obtained at 299.71 degrees C and 28.4 minutes (approximately 300 degrees C and 30 minutes).

In this article, we integrate fuzzy logic and data mining to improve the response time and the accuracy of the retrieval of similar cases. The proposed Fuzzy CBR is composed of two complementary parts; the part of classification by fuzzy decision tree realized by Fispro and the part of case-based reasoning realized by the platform JColibri. The use of fuzzy logic aims to reduce the complexity of calculating the degree of similarity that can exist between diabetic patients who require different monitoring plans. The results of the proposed approach are compared with earlier methods using accuracy as metrics.

However, no prior study exists that connects the measurement of depression and anxiety with the core affect structure and the bipolar dimensions of arousal and valence it includes. This study aims to investigate the reconcilability between a continuous model based on Russell's core affect system and a discrete entity view on depression and anxiety. Methods Results The data were drawn from the anxiety and depression short forms in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (N = 763). It consists of 15 items with a 5-point Likert scale. Ratings of the items in terms of distress and arousal were obtained from experts in emotion research. An approach based on Russell's core affect theory was compared with the common type of factor models in which the items are lined up on clearly separated depression and anxiety dimensions with an empty space in between, as if they are separate and discrete entities. Our alternative model works with a continuous space instead. The core affect theory-based method exhibits a goodness of fit that is comparable with the conventional models. Conclusions Depression and anxiety can be understood in terms of Russell's bipolar core affect model; the core affect-based model leaves room for symptoms in the space between dimensions.";"[Xu, Meng Lin; De Boeck, Paul; Strunk, Daniel] Ohio State Univ, 232 Lazenby Hall,1827 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA";De Boeck, P (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, 232 Lazenby Hall,1827 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;deboeck.2@osu.edu;xu, menglin/AAY-5068-2020;xu, menglin/0000-0001-7895-0733;;;;43;0;0;0;5;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1049-8931;1557-0657;;INT J METH PSYCH RES;Int.

Reporting the obesity data landscape in line with the Foresight obesity system map;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"ENVIRONMENTS; EXPOSURE; DIET";"Background Obesity research at a population level is multifaceted and complex. This has been characterised in the UK by the Foresight obesity systems map, identifying over 100 variables, across seven domain areas which are thought to influence energy balance, and subsequent obesity. Availability of data to consider the whole obesity system is traditionally lacking. However, in an era of big data, new possibilities are emerging. Understanding what data are available can be the first challenge, followed by an inconsistency in data reporting to enable adequate use in the obesity context. In this study we map data sources against the Foresight obesity system map domains and nodes and develop a framework to report big data for obesity research. Opportunities and challenges associated with this new data approach to whole systems obesity research are discussed. Methods Expert opinion from the ESRC Strategic Network for Obesity was harnessed in order to develop a data source reporting framework for obesity research. The framework was then tested on a range of data sources. In order to assess availability of data sources relevant to obesity research, a data mapping exercise against the Foresight obesity systems map domains and nodes was carried out. Results A reporting framework was developed to recommend the reporting of key information in line with these headings: Background; Elements; Exemplars; Content; Ownership; Aggregation; Sharing; Temporality (BEE-COAST). The new BEE-COAST framework was successfully applied to eight exemplar data sources from the UK. 80% coverage of the Foresight obesity systems map is possible using a wide range of big data sources. The remaining 20% were primarily biological measurements often captured by more traditional laboratory based research.

This panel aimed to develop a consensus clinical definition of neurosarcoidosis to enhance the clinical care of patients with suspected neurosarcoidosis and to encourage standardization of research initiatives that address this disease. OBSERVATIONS The work of this collaboration included a review of the manifestations of neurosarcoidosis and the establishment of an approach to the diagnosis of this disorder. The proposed consensus diagnostic criteria, which reflect current knowledge, provide definitions for possible, probable, and definite central and peripheral nervous system sarcoidosis. The definitions emphasize the need to evaluate patients with findings suggestive of neurosarcoidosis for alternate causal factors, including infection and malignant neoplasm. Also emphasized is the need for biopsy, whenever feasible and advisable according to clinical context and affected anatomy, of nonneural tissue to document the presence of systemic sarcoidosis and support a diagnosis of probable neurosarcoidosis or of neural tissue to support a diagnosis of definite neurosarcoidosis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Diverse disease presentations and lack of specificity of relevant diagnostic tests contribute to diagnostic uncertainty. This uncertainty is compounded by the absence of a pathognomonic histologic tissue examination. The diagnostic criteria we propose are designed to focus investigations on NS as accurately as possible, recognizing that multiple pathophysiologic pathways may lead to the clinical manifestations we currently term NS. Research recognizing the clinical heterogeneity of this diagnosis may open the door to identifying meaningful biologic factors that may ultimately contribute to better treatments.;"[Stern, Barney J.; Pardo, Carlos A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurol, 601 N Caroline St,Room 5066B, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Royal, Walter, III] Morehouse Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Atlanta, GA 30310 USA; [Royal, Walter, III] Morehouse Sch Med, Neurosci Inst, Atlanta, GA 30310 USA; [Gelfand, Jeffrey M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA USA; [Clifford, David B.] Washington Univ, Dept Neurol, St Louis, MO USA; [Tavee, Jinny] Northwestern Univ, Dept Neurol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Pawate, Siddharama] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Nashville, TN USA; [Berger, Joseph R.] Univ Penn, Dept Neurol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Aksamit, Allen J.] Mayo Clin, Dept Neurol, Rochester, MN USA; [Krumholz, Allan] Univ Maryland, Dept Neurol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Moller, David R.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Med, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA; [Judson, Marc A.] Albany Med Coll, Dept Med, Albany, NY 12208 USA; [Drent, Marjolein] Maastricht Univ, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Drent, Marjolein] St Antonius Hosp, Interstitial Lung Dis Ctr Excellence, Nieuwegein, Netherlands; [Baughman, Robert P.] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Med, Cincinnati, OH USA";Stern, BJ (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Neurol, 601 N Caroline St,Room 5066B, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA.;bstern6@jhmi.edu;"Drent, Marjolein/ABA-9526-2020; Pardo, Carlos A./A-5192-2008";"Drent, Marjolein/0000-0003-1586-0110; Pardo, Carlos A./0000-0002-4128-5335";;;;35;37;40;1;8;AMER MEDICAL ASSOC;CHICAGO;330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA;2168-6149;2168-6157;;JAMA NEUROL;JAMA Neurol.;DEC;2018;75;12;;;;;1546;1553;;10.1001/jamaneurol.2018.2295;;;8;Clinical Neurology;Neurosciences & Neurology;HD6LH;WOS:000452650900015;30167654;;;;2021-02-18;

However, physiological monitoring using mobile medical sensors is not yet widely used as adding biomedical sensors to mHealth projects inherently introduces new challenges. Thus far, no methodology exists to systematically evaluate these implementation challenges and identify the related risks. Objective: This study aimed to facilitate the implementation of mHealth initiatives with mobile physiological sensing in constrained health systems by developing a methodology to systematically evaluate potential challenges and implementation risks. Methods: We performed a quantitative analysis of physiological data obtained from a randomized household intervention trial that implemented sensor-based mHealth tools (pulse oximetry combined with a respiratory rate assessment app) to monitor health outcomes of 317 children (aged 6-36 months) that were visited weekly by 1 of 9 field workers in a rural Peruvian setting. The analysis focused on data integrity such as data completeness and signal quality. In addition, we performed a qualitative analysis of pretrial usability and semistructured posttrial interviews with a subset of app users (7 field workers and 7 health care center staff members) focusing on data integrity and reasons for loss thereof. Common themes were identified using a content analysis approach. Risk factors of each theme were detailed and then generalized and expanded into a checklist by reviewing 8 mHealth projects from the literature. An expert panel evaluated the checklist during 2 iterations until agreement between the 5 experts was achieved. Results: Pulse oximetry signals were recorded in 78.36% (12,098/15,439) of subject visits where tablets were used. Signal quality decreased for 1 and increased for 7 field workers over time (1 excluded). Usability issues were addressed and the workflow was improved. Users considered the app easy and logical to use. In the qualitative analysis, we constructed a thematic map with the causes of low data integrity. We sorted them into 5 main challenge categories: environment, technology, user skills, user motivation, and subject engagement. The obtained categories were translated into detailed risk factors and presented in the form of an actionable checklist to evaluate possible implementation risks. By visually inspecting the checklist, open issues and sources for potential risks can be easily identified. Conclusions: We developed a data integrity-based methodology to assess the potential challenges and risks of sensor-based mHealth projects. Aiming at improving data integrity, implementers can focus on the evaluation of environment, technology, user skills, user motivation, and subject engagement challenges. We provide a checklist to assist mHealth implementers with a structured evaluation protocol when planning and preparing projects.;"[Zhang, Jia; Tushaus, Laura; Moreo, Monica; Karlen, Walter] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol, Inst Robot & Intelligent Syst, Mobile Hlth Syst Lab, Bldg BAA,Lengghalde 5, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Martinez, Nestor Nuno; Hartinger, Stella M.; Mausezahl, Daniel] Swiss Trop & Publ Hlth Inst, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Basel, Switzerland; [Martinez, Nestor Nuno; Hartinger, Stella M.; Mausezahl, Daniel] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland; [Verastegui, Hector; Hartinger, Stella M.] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru";Karlen, W (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol, Inst Robot & Intelligent Syst, Mobile Hlth Syst Lab, Bldg BAA,Lengghalde 5, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.;walter.karlen@ieee.org;Karlen, Walter/AAN-9397-2020;"Karlen, Walter/0000-0001-8643-3074; Tushaus, Laura/0000-0002-1961-688X; Nuno Martinez, Nestor/0000-0002-4958-6394; Mausezahl, Daniel/0000-0001-5639-5337";"ETH Global seed funding; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [150640]; UBS Optimus Foundation";"The authors would like to thank Matthias Huser who designed the assessment app, translated usability issues into design improvements, and maintained the app throughout the study.

Few studies investigate how humans in combination with facial recognition algorithms perform within different operational contexts. These experiments investigated how the candidate list displayed to facial reviewers affects their performance in a one-to-many unfamiliar face matching task. We tested candidate list length with inexperienced (Experiment 1) and experienced (Experiment 2) facial reviewers. Candidate list length had a large impact on performance, varying with the operational context. However, response-time analyses show that the accurate responses were resolved quickly, with an error-prone guess process implemented after failed search. Long candidate lists (100 images) produced more false alarms, fewer hits, lower decision confidence, and increased response latencies among both inexperienced and experienced facial reviewers.;"[Heyer, Rebecca] Def Sci & Technol Grp, Natl Secur & Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance Div, Edinburgh, SA 5111, Australia; [Semmler, Carolyn] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA *, Australia; [Hendrickson, Andrew T.] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Humanities & Digital Sci, Dept Cognit Sci & Artificial Intelligence, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands";Semmler, C (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Psychol, North Terrace Campus, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.;carolyn.semmler@adelaide.edu.au;Semmler, Carolyn/W-9805-2019;;Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet Research Fund for National Security [PR09-0078];This research was supported by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet Research Funding for National Security (PR09-0078).

The retirement village sector is seeking effective methods of reusing these historical practices to facilitate the future development and operation of sustainable retirement villages. However, this is challenging and there has been no research to date into this issue. Therefore, this study aims to develop a practice mining system (PMS) to address the research gap. By using multiple case studies for data collection and case-based reasoning (CBR) for data mining, the study develops the CBR-PMS, which comprises a Data Transforming and Location System, a Data Warehouse, and a Data Mining and Reusing Engine. The CBR-PMS is a data management and mining system that can be adopted to retain, capture, reuse, and revise prior sustainable practices to facilitate the future development and operation of sustainable retirement villages. Case studies and expert judgements are used in its demonstrations and validation, and satisfactory performance is achieved. It is concluded that the CBR-PMS is an effective tool for retaining and transferring prior practices and acts as an innovative tool of knowledge management and organizational learning in the retirement living sector. Although the CBR-PMS is at its conceptual stage and requires some automation to make it user-friendly, it provides practical insights into the development of a sustainable living environment and benefits the development of data mining systems for other sustainability initiatives.

As a result, new graduates and others making a transition into private practice are likely to encounter complicated, multifaceted variables related to associateship opportunities. Experts in dental education are articulating a need for more instruction in practice management, particularly related to DSOs. Accordingly, this Perspectives article discusses issues in five broad categories focused on vetting career decisions in DSOs: business systems; the dental team and patients; clinical dentistry; compensation and professional development; and ownership positions.

These result in a relatively high percentage of images which are later marked as unreadable by graders. Unreadable images require a recapture which is time and cost intensive. An automated method that determines the image quality during acquisition is an effective alternative. To determine the image quality during acquisition, we describe here an automated method for the assessment of image quality in the context of diabetic retinopathy. The method explicitly applies machine learning techniques to access the image and to determine accept' and reject' categories. Reject' category image requires a recapture. A deep convolution neural network is trained to grade the images automatically. A large representative set of 7000 colour fundus images was used for the experiment which was obtained from the EyePACS that were made available by the California Healthcare Foundation. Three retinal image analysis experts were employed to categorise these images into accept' and reject' classes based on the precise definition of image quality in the context of DR. The network was trained using 3428 images. The method shows an accuracy of 100% to successfully categorise accept' and reject' images, which is about 2% higher than the traditional machine learning method. On a clinical trial, the proposed method shows 97% agreement with human grader. The method can be easily incorporated with the fundus image capturing system in the acquisition centre and can guide the photographer whether a recapture is necessary or not.;"[Saha, Sajib Kumar; Xiao, Di; Kanagasingam, Yogesan] CSIRO, Australian E Hlth Res Ctr, Perth, WA 6014, Australia; [Fernando, Basura] Australian Natl Univ, ACRV, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Cuadros, Jorge] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA";Saha, SK (corresponding author), CSIRO, Australian E Hlth Res Ctr, Perth, WA 6014, Australia.;Sajib.Saha@csiro.au;;;;;;35;15;18;4;15;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES;0897-1889;1618-727X;;J DIGIT IMAGING;J.

One type of these suitable tanks is the floating roof tanks. Among the floating roof tanks, external floating roof tanks are mainly used to store large quantities of petroleum products such as crude oil or condensate, gasoline, kerosene. The purpose of this study is prioritizing the causes of fire and explosion in the external floating roof tanks. In this study, firstly, the causes of fire and explosion of the external floating roof tanks were identified and then the obtained variables were scored by the process and safety specialists. In the next step, the causes were weighed and prioritized using the analytic network process method and Super Decisions software. The findings of the study identified 11 main criteria and 71 sub-criteria for fire and explosion of external floating roof tanks. Results revealed that several effective risk factors in the fire and explosion are natural disasters, static electricity, operational error, faulty firefighting system, maintenance error, piping rupture/leak, equipment/instrument failure, open flames, tank crack/rupture, runaway reactions, and sabotage, respectively. This study will help experts to identify the effective risk factors in fire and explosion in external floating roof tanks and their importance. Therefore, they can prioritize and implement the control measures to prevent fire and explosion incidents in external floating roof tanks.;"[Moshashaei, Parisa; Alizadeh, Seyed Shamseddin] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Hlth Fac, Dept Occupat Hlth Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [Jafarabadi, Mohammad Asghari] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Rd Traff Injury Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran; [Jafarabadi, Mohammad Asghari] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Hlth Fac, Dept Stat & Epidemiol, Tabriz, Iran; [Khazini, Leila] Tabriz Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Chem & Petr Engn Fac, Tabriz, Iran";Alizadeh, SS (corresponding author), Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Hlth Fac, Dept Occupat Hlth Engn, Tabriz, Iran.;"parisamoshashai@gmail.com; ss.alizadeh2013@gmail.com; m.asghari862@gmail.com; khazini@tabrizu.ac.ir";;;Health Faculty of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences [5/D/35901];The authors are grateful to Health Faculty of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences for funding this work under the master's thesis (Project Reference: 5/D/35901).

A day-based anchored cross-validation experimental protocol is also provided that can be used as a benchmark for comparing the performance of state-of-the-art methodologies. Performance of baseline approaches are also provided to facilitate experimental comparisons. We expect that such a large-scale dataset can serve as a testbed for devising novel solutions of expert systems for high-frequency limit order book data analysis.;"[Ntakaris, Adamantios; Gabbouj, Moncef] Tampere Univ Technol, Lab Signal Proc, Korkeakoulunkatu 1, Tampere, Finland; [Magris, Martin; Kanniainen, Juho] Tampere Univ Technol, Lab Ind & Informat Management, Tampere, Finland; [Iosifidis, Alexandros] Aarhus Univ, Dept Engn Elect & Comp Engn, Aarhus, Denmark";Ntakaris, A (corresponding author), Tampere Univ Technol, Lab Signal Proc, Korkeakoulunkatu 1, Tampere, Finland.;adamantios.ntakaris@tut.fi;"Gabbouj, Moncef/G-4293-2014; Iosifidis, Alexandros/G-2433-2013";"Gabbouj, Moncef/0000-0002-9788-2323; Kanniainen, Juho/0000-0001-7737-659X; Iosifidis, Alexandros/0000-0003-4807-1345";H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions [MSCA-ITN-ETN 675044];H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions, Grant/Award Number: MSCA-ITN-ETN 675044;;62;14;14;0;10;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0277-6693;1099-131X;;J FORECASTING;J.

In this article, we propose a definition of prospective LCA: An LCA is prospective when the (emerging) technology studied is in an early phase of development (e.g., small-scale production), but the technology is modeled at a future, more-developed phase (e.g., large-scale production). Methodological choices in prospective LCA must be adapted to reflect this goal of assessing environmental impacts of emerging technologies, which deviates from the typical goals of conventional LCA studies. The aim of the article is to provide a number of recommendations for how to conduct such prospective assessments in a relevant manner. The recommendations are based on a detailed review of selected prospective LCA case studies, mainly from the areas of nanomaterials, biomaterials, and energy technologies. We find that it is important to include technology alternatives that are relevant for the future in prospective LCA studies. Predictive scenarios and scenario ranges are two general approaches to prospective inventory modeling of both foreground and background systems. Many different data sources are available for prospective modeling of the foreground system: scientific articles; patents; expert interviews; unpublished experimental data; and process modeling. However, we caution against temporal mismatches between foreground and background systems, and recommend that foreground and background system impacts be reported separately in order to increase the usefulness of the results in other prospective studies.";"[Arvidsson, Rickard; Tillman, Anne-Marie; Sanden, Bjorn A.; Janssen, Matty; Nordelof, Anders; Kushnir, Duncan; Molander, Sverker] Chalmers Univ Technol, Environm Syst Anal, Rannvagen 6, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden";Arvidsson, R (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Environm Syst Anal, Rannvagen 6, SE-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.;rickard.arvidsson@chalmers.se;"Molander, Sverker/E-1462-2012; Arvidsson, Rickard/AAV-7598-2020";"Molander, Sverker/0000-0002-9081-8847; Arvidsson, Rickard/0000-0002-9258-0641; Nordelof, Anders/0000-0002-7455-7341; Janssen, Matty/0000-0002-5314-7968";Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas)Swedish Research Council Formas;This work has been supported by the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas).;;61;57;58;5;44;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1088-1980;1530-9290;;J IND ECOL;J.

In the following years, the programs were expanded and new laboratory requirements were inserted to the LIS. In the last few years, the requirements have grown more and more. The current tasks of the LIS are not only the management of laboratory requirements but also management of processes, data security and data transfer and they have become very important. Therefore, the current monolithic architecture of LIS has reached its limits. New methodologies like service oriented architecture, e.g. microservices, should be implemented. Thereby different specialized manufacturers provide software for one or a few tasks. These tasks can be more easily actualized like in the new field of agile software development. This new concept has been designed to provide updates and customer requirements according to its new organization structure in program development in a short time. For efficient data transfer, new interfaces and a standardization of master data like logical observation identifier names and codes (LOINC (R)) are advisable. With the growing data transfer, data security plays an increasingly important role. New concepts like blockchain programming (e.g. Medrec) are currently tested in (laboratory) medicine. To get an overview of the requirements of the own LIS, an Ishikawa diagram should be created. The main points of an Ishikawa diagram are shown and discussed. Based on the today-collected data, expert systems will be developed. For this kind of data mining, a structured data exchange is necessary.;"[Durner, Juergen] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Operat Restorat Dent Periodontol & Pedodont, Fac Med, Goethestr 70, D-80336 Munich, Germany; [Durner, Juergen] Lab Becker & Colleagues, Munich, Germany";"Durner, J (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Operat Restorat Dent Periodontol & Pedodont, Fac Med, Goethestr 70, D-80336 Munich, Germany.; Durner, J (corresponding author), Lab Becker & Colleagues, Munich, Germany.";juergen.durner@med.uni-muenchen.de;;;;;;30;2;2;1;15;WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH;BERLIN;GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY;2567-9430;2567-9449;;J LAB MED;J.

However, MWS setting is a very complicated process, and most countries currently do so with the help of a computer-aided decision system. In general, a decision system can generate multiple alternatives for MWS within an acceptable time. Therefore, how to choose the best option from the alternatives is a vital decision. This paper presents a novel framework for MWS evaluation based on the Chinese railway system. Specifically, the requirements of each department related to MWS setting are analysed, and we construct an evaluation indicator system for MWS based on the preferences of different departments. Then, we apply the fuzzy soft set theory to MWS evaluation, a method that not only effectively deals with evaluation of uncertain information, but also gives flexibility for experts to input their subjective judgment. Additionally, using the AND operation of soft set theory allows combing evaluation information from multiple evaluators to give comprehensive results. Finally, a case study illustrates the proposed framework, showing that the proposed evaluation indicator system and evaluation method are effective and practical.;"[Xu, Changan; Ni, Shaoquan; Chen, Dingjun] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Transportat & Logist, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Changan] Interuniv Res Ctr Enterprise Networks Logist & Tr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ni, Shaoquan; Chen, Dingjun] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Natl Railway Train Diagram Res & Training Ctr, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Ni, Shaoquan; Chen, Dingjun] Natl & Local Joint Engn Lab Comprehens Intelligen, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China";"Xu, CG (corresponding author), Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Transportat & Logist, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China.; Xu, CG (corresponding author), Interuniv Res Ctr Enterprise Networks Logist & Tr, Montreal, PQ, Canada.";bk20085673@my.swjtu.edu.cn;;;"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61273242, 61403317]; Science and Technology Plan of Sichuan province [2017015]; Service Science and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province [KL1701]";This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Nos. 61273242, 61403317), Science and Technology Plan of Sichuan province (Project No. 2017015), and Service Science and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province (KL1701).;;16;1;1;0;4;SPRINGEROPEN;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND;2095-087X;2196-0577;;J MOD TRANSP;J.

Intervention developers and experts in pediatric obesity, exercise physiology, dietetics, and the local parks system provided input for changes. Hispanic families also provided input through a series of 21 focus groups conducted before, during, and after an initial pilot test of the adapted intervention. After transcribing audiotaped sessions, we used a general inductive approach and Dedoose qualitative software to derive themes. Results indicated the need for improved health-related family functioning, enhanced nutrition education and skill building, increased family engagement in physical activity, and stronger links between family and environmental supports. Parents who participated in the pilot test expressed high enthusiasm for hands-on nutrition training and reported improvements in family functioning. Adolescents liked outdoor physical activities but wanted parents to be more engaged in joint physical activity sessions. The adapted intervention maintains fidelity to Familias Unidas' core theoretical elements and overall structure, but also includes content focused on physical activity and nutrition, adolescent participation in physical activity sessions led by park coaches, and joint parent-adolescent participation in physical activity and nutrition skill-building activities.;"[St George, Sara M.; Messiah, Sarah E.; Poma, Sofia; Lebron, Cynthia; Tapia, Maria I.; Velazquez, Maria Rosa; Pantin, Hilda; Prado, Guillermo] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, 1120 NW 14th St,Suite 1009, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Messiah, Sarah E.; Sardinas, Krystal M.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Miami, FL 33136 USA";St George, SM (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, 1120 NW 14th St,Suite 1009, Miami, FL 33136 USA.;s.stgeorge@med.miami.edu;;Messiah, Sarah/0000-0001-6685-2175;"NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [R01 DA040756] Funding Source: Medline; NIMHD NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Minority Health & Health Disparities (NIMHD) [R01 MD007724] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [R01DA040756, R01DA040756, R01DA040756, R01DA040756, R01DA040756] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; National Institute on Minority Health and Health DisparitiesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Minority Health & Health Disparities (NIMHD) [R01MD007724, R01MD007724] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";;;43;4;4;0;7;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0278-095X;1573-6547;;J PRIM PREV;J.

In this study, we compared the discriminatory ability of experts and crowdsourced evaluators (the Crowd) to detect differences in robotic automated performance metrics (APMs). APMs (instrument motion tracking and events data directly from the robot system) of anterior vesico-urethral anastomoses (VUAs) of robotic radical prostatectomies were captured by the dVLogger (Intuitive Surgical). Crowdsourced evaluators and four expert surgeons evaluated video footage using the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) (individual domains and total score). Cases were then stratified into performance groups (high versus low quality) for each evaluator based on GEARS. APMs from each group were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. 25 VUAs performed by 11 surgeons were evaluated. The Crowd displayed moderate correlation with averaged expert scores for all GEARS domains (r>0.58, p<0.01). Bland-Altman analysis showed a narrower total GEARS score distribution by the Crowd compared to experts. APMs compared amongst performance groups for each evaluator showed that through GEARS scoring, the most common differentiated metric by evaluators was the velocity of the dominant instrument arm. The Crowd outperformed two out of four expert evaluators by discriminating differences in three APMs using total GEARS scores. The Crowd assigns a narrower range of GEARS scores compared to experts but maintains overall agreement with experts. The discriminatory ability of the Crowd at discerning differences in robotic movements (via APMs) through GEARS scoring is quite refined, rivaling that of expert evaluators.;"[Oh, Paul J.; Chen, Jian; Hatcher, David; Djaladat, Hooman; Hung, Andrew J.] Univ Southern Calif, Catherine & Joseph Aresty Dept Urol, Ctr Robot Simulat & Educ, Inst Urol, 1441 Eastlake Ave,Suite 7416, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA";Hung, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Catherine & Joseph Aresty Dept Urol, Ctr Robot Simulat & Educ, Inst Urol, 1441 Eastlake Ave,Suite 7416, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.;"Paul.Oh@med.usc.edu; Jian.Chen@med.usc.edu; David.Hatcher@med.usc.edu; djaladat@med.usc.edu; Andrew.Hung@med.usc.edu";;Oh, Paul/0000-0001-6119-4265;Intuitive Surgical;Paul J.

To overcome this problem, several algorithms and checklists have been proposed. However, they generally demonstrated modest level of diagnostic accuracy, unsatisfactory concordance between dermoscopists and/or poor specificity. Objective Methods To test a new methodological approach for the differentiation between early melanoma and atypical nevi, based on an integrated clinical-anamnestic dermoscopic risk scoring system (iDScore). We selected a total of 435 standardized dermoscopic images of clinically atypical melanocytic skin lesion (MSL) excised in the suspect of malignancy (i.e. 134 early melanomas - MM - and 301 atypical nevi). Data concerning patient age and sex and lesion dimension and site were collected. A scoring classifier was designed based on this data set integrated with the dermoscopic evaluations performed by three experts blinded to histological diagnosis. Results Conclusion A total of seven dermoscopic structures, three age groups (30-40 years, 41-60 years and >60 years), two maximum diameter categories (5-10 mm and >10 mm) and three body areas (i.e. frequently, chronically and seldom photoexposed sites) were selected by the scoring classifier as interdependently significant variables. The total risk score (S) of a lesion resulted from the simple sum of partial scores assigned to each selected variable. The iDScore-aided diagnosis showed an high accuracy (receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve = 0.903; IC: 95% = 0.887-0.918). A risk-based criticality scale corresponding to different S ranges was proposed. The iDScore checklist is proposed as a feasible and efficient tool to support dermatologists in non-invasive differentiation between atypical nevi and early MM on the basis of few selected clinical-anamnestic data and standardized dermoscopic features.";"[Tognetti, L.; Cinotti, E.; Fimiani, M.; Rubegni, P.] Univ Siena, Dept Med Surg & NeuroSci, Dermatol Unit, Siena, Italy; [Tognetti, L.; Cevenini, G.] Univ Siena, Dept Med Biotechnol, Siena, Italy; [Moscarella, E.; Argenziano, G.] Univ Campania, Dermatol Unit, Naples, Italy; [Moscarella, E.; Longo, C.] IRCCS, Skin Canc Unit Arcispedale S Maria Nuova, Reggio Emilia, Italy; [Farnetani, F.; Longo, C.; Pellacani, G.] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Dermatol, Modena, Italy; [Mahlvey, J.] Univ Barcelona, Melanoma Unit, Dept Dermatol, Barcelona, Spain; [Perrot, J.

Transit-oriented development (TOD) planning has emerged as an applicable planning method, which tries to achieve integrated land-use and transportation planning. In this research, a novel methodology was proposed to develop an efficient TOD index measuring land-use characteristics in neighborhoods of an urban region in Tehran, Iran. This index helps urban planners make optimum decisions regarding the development of public transit services in the region. In this research, a comprehensive set of criteria and indicators were developed to compute TOD index. Each indicator was computed using spatial analyses in the vector format since most of the indicators were spatial indicators and compatible with the vector format. Then the indicators were aggregated by hierarchical fuzzy inference system (HFIS) because of the large number of the rules. By such an aggregation method, the model considered the uncertainties and linguistic terms of experts' rules as well as decreasing the number of rules from 1,600,000 to 221. Due to the fact that the research data were related to the year 2005, the activities that have been conducted since 2005 were evaluated based on the model output. The results demonstrate that TOD planning enables urban planners not only to determine shortcomings of land-use characteristics, but also to allocate public transit services in different neighborhoods.

In particular, the research focuses on fault detection and diagnostics of rolling element bearings. The proposed method is based on mapping the vibrational response onto the density space and approximating the density using orthogonal functions. The method has been applied to vibration data of a rotating machine where the data were measured by proximity probes. The method was applied to two operating conditions: constant operating speed and variable operating speed. As will be shown, the proposed feature extraction method has an outstanding capability in characterizing the system response and diagnosing the system. The method is evidently robust to noise, does not depend on expert knowledge about the system, requires no feature ranking or selection, and can easily be applied in an automated process. Finally, a comparison with utilization of statistical features is performed for each operating condition, which demonstrates that the proposed method performs better than the traditional statistical methods.;"[Mohamad, T.

However, it would be unsuitable to construct an agent with a decision-making system based only on the elaboration of such a profile, as this would prevent the agent from having its own identity, which would leave the agent at the mercy of its opponent. Following this direction, this study proposes an automatic Checkers player, called ACE-RL-Checkers, equipped with a dynamic decision-making module, which adapts to the profile of the opponent over the course of the game. In such a system, the action selection process is conducted through a composition of multilayer perceptron neural network and case library. In this case, the neural network represents the identity of the agent, i.e., it is an already trained static decision-making module. On the other hand, the case library represents the dynamic decision-making module of the agent, which is generated by the Automatic Case Elicitation technique. This technique has a pseudo-random exploratory behavior, which allows the dynamic decision-making of the agent to be directed either by the opponent's game profile or randomly. In order to avoid a high occurrence of pseudo-random decision-making in the game initial phasesin which the agent counts on very little information about its opponentthis work proposes a new module based on sequential pattern mining for generating a base of experience rules extracted from human expert's game records. This module will improve the agent's move selection in the game initial phases. Experiments carried out in tournaments involving ACE-RL-Checkers and other agents correlated to this work, confirm the superiority of the dynamic architecture proposed herein.;"[Neto, Henrique Castro; Silva Julia, Rita Maria] Univ Fed Uberlandia, Comp Sci Dept, Campus Santa Monica,Av Joao Naves de Avila 2121, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil";Neto, HC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Uberlandia, Comp Sci Dept, Campus Santa Monica,Av Joao Naves de Avila 2121, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil.;"henriquecneto@yahoo.com.br; rita@ufu.br";;;FAPEMIG (Brazil)Minas Gerais State Research Foundation (FAPEMIG);The authors thank FAPEMIG (Brazil) for fellowships and financial support.;;42;4;4;0;36;SPRINGER LONDON LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;0219-1377;0219-3116;;KNOWL INF SYST;Knowl.

However, the two objectives may not be consistent with each other under many practical conditions, especially for complex systems with multiple influential factors. The belief rule base (BRB) has shown advantages in nonlinear complex system modeling under uncertainty. However, most of current works on BRB has focused only on the modeling accuracy. As such, an Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)-based objective, AIC(BRB), is deduced to represent both the modeling accuracy (denoted by the Mean Square Error (MSE)) and the modeling complexity (denoted by the number of the parameters). Based on the proposed AIC(BRB), a bi-level optimization model and a corresponding bi-level optimization algorithm are developed. Moreover, an empirical optimization path search strategy is proposed for upper-level optimization. The optimization path is comprised of multiple solutions with optimal performance. After the BRB learning process, both the structure and the parameters of BRB are optimized, which identifies the best decision structure of BRB. A numerical multi-extreme function case and a practical pipeline leak detection case are studied. The results show that an optimization path could be identified with a series of optimal solutions. With AIC(BRB) as the objective, the jointly optimized BRB in the best decision structure can be obtained with an improved modeling accuracy as well as reduced modeling complexity.;"[Chang Leilei; Xu Xiaobin] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Automat, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chang Leilei; Tan Xu] Shenzhen Inst Informat Technol, Sch Software Engn, Shenzhen 518172, Peoples R China; [Chang Leilei; Zhou Zhijie] High Tech Inst Xian, Xian 710025, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen Yuwang] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Decis & Cognit Sci Res Ctr, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England; [Sun Jianbin] Natl Univ Def Technol, Sch Informat Syst & Management, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Liao Tianjun] Beijing Inst Syst Engn, State Key Lab Complex Syst Simulat, 10 An Xiang Bei Li Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China";Tan, X (corresponding author), Shenzhen Inst Informat Technol, Sch Software Engn, Shenzhen 518172, Peoples R China.;tanxu_nudt@163.com;"; Chen, Yu-wang/A-1129-2019";"Chang, Leilei/0000-0002-0126-0635; Chen, Yu-wang/0000-0002-2007-1821";"National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71601180, 71671186, 71401167, 61370031, 61374138, 61773388, 61751304, 61702142]; NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Fund for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization [U1709215]; Post -Doctorial Science Foundation [2015M570847, 2016T90938]; Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province [617120]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Liberal Arts and Social Sciences FoundationMinistry of Education, China [17YJCZH157]; Pengcheng Scholar Funded Scheme";This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China under Grants 71601180, 71671186, 71401167, 61370031, 61374138, 61773388, 61751304, and 61702142.

With this article we intend to fill this gap and inform the experts of library and information science of some of the most recent Hungarian innovations. After showcasing the international professional connections of Hungarian librarianship, we present the structure of the Hungarian public library network and its mode of operation. We also analyse current and future main digital development plans, projects and the most important related professional activities of Hungarian libraries. Emphasis is placed on information systems promoting cooperation between libraries and the issues of the National Library System Project, which is a large-scale modernisation programme carried out between 2016 and 2018, designed to develop the IT system of the National Szechenyi Library. After introducing the information systems of academic and specialised libraries and the access models of scientific databases provided by multinational and Hungarian content services, we also discuss the endeavours of public libraries aiming for multifunctionality and community organisation. The paper ends by providing insights into how the outcomes of the recent initiatives have been fed back into Hungarian LIS training courses offered in higher education.;"[Kiszl, Peter] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Inst Lib & Informat Sci, Budapest, Hungary; [Rado, Rita; Hubay, Miklos Peter] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Doctoral Sch Literary Studies, LIS Program, Budapest, Hungary";Kiszl, P (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Inst Lib & Informat Sci, Budapest, Hungary.;"kiszl.peter@btk.elte.hu; rado.rita@oszk.hu; hubaym@pim.hu";Kiszl, Peter/J-3336-2017;Kiszl, Peter/0000-0003-2992-295X;;;;45;1;1;1;9;WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH;BERLIN;GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY;0024-2667;1865-8423;;LIBRI;Libri;DEC;2018;68;4;;;;;315;329;;10.1515/libri-2018-0049;;;15;Information Science & Library Science;Information Science & Library Science;HC4XS;WOS:000451808700004;;;;;2021-02-18;

In this work, we develop a computer aided diagnosis system for automatic grading of PCa in digitized histopathology images using supervised learning methods. Our pipeline comprises extraction of multi-scale features that include glandular, cellular, and image-based features. A number of novel features are proposed based on intra- and inter-nuclei properties: these features are shown to be among the most important ones for classification. We train our classifiers on 333 tissue microarray (TMA) cores that were sampled from 231 radical prostatectomy patients and annotated in detail by six pathologists for different Gleason grades. We also demonstrate the TMA-trained classifier's performance on additional 230 whole-mount slides of 56 patients, independent of the training dataset, by examining the automatic grading on manually marked lesions and randomly sampled 10% of the benign tissue. For the first time, we incorporate a probabilistic approach for supervised learning by multiple experts to account for the inter-observer grading variability. Through cross-validation experiments, the overall grading agreement of the classifier with the pathologists was found to be an unweighted kappa of 0.51, while the overall agreements between each pathologist and the others ranged from 0.45 to 0.62. These results suggest that our classifier's performance is within the inter-observer grading variability levels across the pathologists in our study, which are also consistent with those reported in the literature.

A uniform classification framework for NENs at any anatomical location may reduce inconsistencies and contradictions among the various systems currently in use. The classification suggested here is intended to allow pathologists and clinicians to manage their patients with NENs consistently, while acknowledging organ-specific differences in classification criteria, tumor biology, and prognostic factors. The classification suggested is based on a consensus conference held at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in November 2017 and subsequent discussion with additional experts. The key feature of the new classification is a distinction between differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), also designated carcinoid tumors in some systems, and poorly differentiated NECs, as they both share common expression of neuroendocrine markers. This dichotomous morphological subdivision into NETs and NECs is supported by genetic evidence at specific anatomic sites as well as clinical, epidemiologic, histologic, and prognostic differences. In many organ systems, NETs are graded as G1, G2, or G3 based on mitotic count and/or Ki-67 labeling index, and/or the presence of necrosis; NECs are considered high grade by definition. We believe this conceptual approach can form the basis for the next generation of NEN classifications and will allow more consistent taxonomy to understand how neoplasms from different organ systems inter-relate clinically and genetically.";"[Rindi, Guido] Univ Cattolica, Fdn Policlin Univ A Gemelli, Ist Anat Patol, Rome, Italy; [Klimstra, David S.; Busam, Klaus J.; Travis, William D.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Abedi-Ardekani, Behnoush; Fernandez-Cuesta, Lynnette; Ohgaki, Hiroko; Cree, Ian A.] WHO, IARC, Lyon, France; [Asa, Sylvia L.] Univ Toronto, Univ Hlth Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Bosman, Frederik T.] Univ Lausanne, Med Ctr, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Brambilla, Elisabeth] Univ UGA, CHUGA, Grenoble, France; [de Krijger, Ronald R.] Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Pathol, Utrecht, Netherlands; [de Krijger, Ronald R.] Princess Maxima Ctr Pediat Oncol, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Dietel, Manfred] Charite, Berlin, Germany; [El-Naggar, Adel K.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Kloeppel, Guenter] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Pathol, Munich, Germany; [McCluggage, W.

To address this important clinical issue, we developed a data management system, based on smart device technology, and evaluated the benefit of this information to medical experts in helping them to form an impression of patients' health and disease, and treatment status before examination. Methods Fifty-seven patients with RA input relevant information about their condition and responses to a self-report health assessment questionnaire into a smart device template before their scheduled examination. The efficacy of the system was assessed as a decrease in examination time at each visit, and the correlation between the self-reported Multi-Dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire and the 28-joint Disease Activity Score 28-joint count erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), which was used as a gold standard. Results Examination duration was reduced in most patients at each visit. During the study, there were no limitations for patients with poor eyesight or severe arthropathy in using the system.

The role of insulin in PCOS is pivotal both in regulating the activity of ovarian and liver enzymes, respectively involved in androgen production and in triggering low-grade inflammation usually reported to be associated with an insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and cardiometabolic diseases. Although an acute hyperglycaemia induced by oral glucose loading may increase inflammation and oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species through different mechanisms, the postprandial glucose increment, commonly associated with the Western diet, represents the major contributor of chronic sustained hyperglycaemia and pro-inflammatory state. Together with hyperinsulinaemia, hyperandrogenism and low-grade inflammation, unhealthy diet should be viewed as a key component of the 'deadly quartet' of metabolic risk factors associated with PCOS pathophysiology. The identification of a tight diet-inflammation-health association makes the adoption of healthy nutritional approaches a primary preventive and therapeutic tool in women with PCOS, weakening insulin resistance and eventually promoting improvements of reproductive life and endocrine outcomes. The intriguing nutritional-endocrine connections operating in PCOS underline the role of expert nutritionists in the management of this syndrome. The aim of the present review is to provide an at-a-glance overview of the possible bi-directional mechanisms linking inflammation, androgen excess and carbohydrate intake in women with PCOS.;"[Barrea, Luigi; Muscogiuri, Giovanna; Colao, Annamaria; Savastano, Silvia] Univ Naples Federico II, Med Sch Naples, Dipartimento Med Clin & Chirurgia, Via Sergio Pansini 5, I-80131 Naples, Italy; [Marzullo, Paolo] Osped S Giuseppe, IRCCS Ist Auxol Italiano, Div Gen Med, I-28921 Piancavallo Verbania, Italy; [Di Somma, Carolina] IRCCS SDN, Napoli Via Gianturco 113, I-80143 Naples, Italy; [Scacchi, Massimo] Univ Milan, Dept Clin Sci & Community Hlth, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Orio, Francesco] Parthenope Univ Naples, Dept Sports Sci & Wellness, Via Ammiraglio Ferdinando Acton 38, I-80133 Naples, Italy; [Aimaretti, Gianluca] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Translat Med, Via Solaroli 17, I-28100 Novara, Italy";Barrea, L (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Med Sch Naples, Dipartimento Med Clin & Chirurgia, Via Sergio Pansini 5, I-80131 Naples, Italy.;luigi.barrea@unina.it;"Muscogiuri, Giovanna/K-5817-2016; Marzullo, Paolo/K-6371-2016; Barrea, Luigi/K-6551-2016";"Marzullo, Paolo/0000-0003-3215-5747; Barrea, Luigi/0000-0001-9054-456X";;;;134;13;14;4;27;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;CAMBRIDGE;EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND;0954-4224;1475-2700;;NUTR RES REV;Nutr.

Synchronization is a prime example of a potential bottleneck, but is a necessary evil when writing parallel programs; we must enforce correct access to shared data. Even the most expert programmers may find synchronization to be a significant overhead in their application. Techniques to mitigate synchronization overhead include speculative lock elision, faster hardware barriers, and load balancing via dynamic voltage and frequency scaling. A key insight is that the timing of synchronization events, impacted not only by the progress of the current thread but also others, is fundamental to an application's performance. To enable a better understanding of multithreaded applications, we introduce a new level of abstraction for multi-core evaluation and propose an analytical model centered around the timing and ordering of synchronization events. Our model allows research across the stack to evaluate the performance of applications on future, non-existent systems and architectures. Compared to real hardware, our model estimates performance with a geometric average of 7.2% error across thirteen benchmarks and can generate performance characteristics per thread in less than a minute on average for very large (native) inputs.

The ITB functions as a reference center for the international institutions participating in the clinical trials of the CESS group, but is also available internationally to patients who have not been treated within an appropriate clinical trial. The value of tumor boards in terms of benefit for the patients and the health care system in general is not well documented and is also the subject of controversial discussions. A review of the representative literature is included. MethodsResultsData were analyzed from 481 patients who had been registered into the European Ewing Tumor Working Initiative of National Groups (EURO E.W.I.N.G.-99) clinical trial via the CESS data center between 2006 and 2009; this included 331 patients with localized disease and another 150 individuals with metastases at diagnosis. Median follow-up time was 3.2 years. Improved OAS was observed for patients with metastases who had received recommendations from the ITB compared with those who had not received recommendations. In patients with localized disease, a recommendation from the ITB had no influence on OAS. ConclusionAs a reference center for a rare disease, recommendations from our ITB impacted local therapy and led to higher OAS in patients with metastatic disease.

Geologic facies or rock types are routinely interpreted from petrographic features in thin sections, hut these methods are time consuming and tedious. The interpretations can be heavily biased. Variations in experience base, microscope quality, and scale of observation can lead to inconsistent interpretations, absorbing costly time to achieve alignment. With advances in computing, millions of images can be analyzed in seconds through signal-processing technologies. With this capability, machine-learning methods can support geologic pattern identification to classify geologic features. Combined, automated image analysis and classification though machine learning can significantly reduce analysis time, interpreter bias and inconsistencies. These methods make it possible to share expert knowledge with nonexpert users. Image processing, segmentation and classification are key workflows for translating geologic features into discrete representations that can be used for computational modeling. Here, we present two examples where advanced image analysis and machine learning are used to predict geologic and petrophysical properties from optical microscopy thin-section images. The first example uses multiple machine-learning algorithms and pore geometries as a means for predicting and classifying rock properties, such as lithofacies, reservoir zone, porosity and permeability. The second example focuses on training and using convolutional neural networks to classify and predict Dunham textures (mudstone, wackestone, packstone and grainstone) from carbonate thin sections. Data for both machine-learning applications comes from a Jurassic bimodal carbonate reservoir. Key depositional lithofacies include micritic mudstones, bivalve-coated grain pack/grainstones, Cladocoropsis pack/grainstones, stromatoporoid coralgal pack/grainstones, and skeletal oolitic grainstones. Key geological features, pore fabric analysis and depositional textures were documented via optical light microscopy. In addition, standard petrophysical measurements (porosity, permeability and grain density) were available from the corresponding core plugs. Although several key uncertainties exist in using machine-learning models for prediction of geological and petrophysical features, these two examples highlight the potential for combining advanced image analysis and data-driven analytical techniques. These approaches can be extended to other multiscalc, multidimensional imaging applications in geoscience, such as core and borehole imaging, CT scanning, LIDAR and hyperspectral imaging.;"[Jobe, T.

An iterative reweighting scheme was applied during image reconstruction to ensure fast convergence and high image quality. Shearlets are mathematically optimal for a simplified model of natural images and have been proven to be more efficient than classical systems such as wavelets. 3DShearCS was compared to three other commonly used reconstruction approaches. Image quality was assessed quantitatively using general image quality metrics and using clinical diagnostic scores from expert reviewers. The proposed technique had lower relative errors, higher structural similarity and higher diagnostic scores compared to the other reconstruction techniques especially for high undersampling factors, i.e. short scan times. 3DShearCS provided ensured accurate depiction of cardiac anatomy for fast imaging and could help to promote 3D high-resolution CMR in clinical practice.;"[Ma, Jackie] Heinrich Hertz Inst Nachrichtentech Berlin GmbH, Fraunhofer Inst Telecommun, Image & Video Coding Grp, Berlin, Germany; [Maerz, Maximilian; Kutyniok, Gitta] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Math, Berlin, Germany; [Funk, Stephanie; Schulz-Menger, Jeanette] HELIOS Klinikum Berlin Buch, Dept Cardiol & Nephrol, Berlin, Germany; [Schaeffter, Tobias; Kolbitsch, Christoph] PTB, Braunschweig, Germany; [Schaeffter, Tobias; Kolbitsch, Christoph] PTB, Berlin, Germany; [Schaeffter, Tobias; Kolbitsch, Christoph] Kings Coll London, Sch Biomed Engn & Imaging Sci, London, England; [Funk, Stephanie; Schulz-Menger, Jeanette] Expt & Clin Res Ctr, Working Grp Cardiovasc Magnet Resonance, Berlin, Germany";Ma, J (corresponding author), Heinrich Hertz Inst Nachrichtentech Berlin GmbH, Fraunhofer Inst Telecommun, Image & Video Coding Grp, Berlin, Germany.;jackie.ma@hhi.fraunhofer.de;Schaeffter, Tobias/AAI-6826-2020;Schaeffter, Tobias/0000-0003-1310-2631;"DFG Collaborative Research CenterGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [TRR 109]; Berlin Mathematical School; Einstein Foundation Berlin; Einstein Center for Mathematics Berlin (ECMath); DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC/TR 109, CRC 1114, SPP 1798]; RTG DAEDALUS [RTG 2433]; RTG BIOQIC [RTG 2260]";This work was done when J Ma was affiliated with the Technische Universitat Berlin, he acknowledges support from the DFG Collaborative Research Center TRR 109 'Discretization in Geometry and Dynamics' and the Berlin Mathematical School.

This study uses a complex adaptive systems lens, focusing specifically on the properties of projects as agents in a complex adaptive portfolio to critically appraise current thinking on portfolio management in an agile context. We then draw on a set of 30 expert interviews to develop 16 complex adaptive systems (CAS)-based propositions as to how portfolios of agile projects can be managed effectively.

A new expert investigation is proposed with small probability intervals, expert weights, confidence index, etc. After gaining expert judgment by expert investigation, Chauvenet's criterion is first introduced in a discrepancy analysis to eliminate outlier data from the expert judgment and obtain a more reliable value. The t distribution and its confidence interval are also adopted to determine the characteristic value of the survey data as a triangular fuzzy number. A conditional probability table of the model is integrated with historical data and prior knowledge through the weight index. Sensitivity analysis is used to identify the critical factors by changing the probability distribution of each factor and observing the related changes in the risk event. The proposed method ensures the accuracy and scientific rigor of the assessment and the diagnosis of a tunnel accident.

In this study, a Bayesian belief network (BBN) based buried infrastructure consequence model is developed to assess the consequence index and to prioritize the buried infrastructures for maintenance/ rehabilitation/ replacement. The causal relationships between different parameters are constructed based on published literature and expert knowledge. The proposed model can provide information at pipe level by estimating the health & safety impact, environmental impact, social impact, and economical & organizational impact due to failure. The proposed model is also capable of highlighting the most sensitive and vulnerable pipes within the network. The applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated on the wastewater collection network of the City of Vernon, BC.

Not only the economy, but the safety factors need to be considered for making a comprehensive analysis and determining an appropriate design plan. However, the railway network route selection is a complex multi-objective decision problem. Considering the construction cost and safety factors of hazardous liquid railway, this paper proposed a multi-objective optimization model. Considering the impact metrics, air pollution, river pollution, soil-underground water pollution, sensitive area and emergency system, a comprehensive risk assessment model was further built. The weight of each metric was decided by expert scoring. Based on index pricing method, risk factors were considered into maintenance and operation cost. Aiming at the strong non-linearity, a three-stage method was adopted to solve the problem. A virtual case and a real case with two refineries as sources and two terminals in midwestem China were studied in this paper.

Therefore, the parameters of a risk factor, severity, and likelihood are evaluated to measure the risk value using a conventional matrix method. In this study, the intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) approach is proposed to deal with limitations of a crisp risk matrix and uncertainties of group decision makers using experts' opinions in linguistic terms. In addition, the objectives of this paper were to improve the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach and obtain an effective and comprehensive risk assessment technique. The proposed methodology was applied as a case study on a gas refinery for the welding and lamination task, and all identified hazards were prioritized by the modified TOPSIS approach for further corrective actions.;[Yazdi, Mohammad] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Ctr Marine Technol & Ocean Engn CENTEC, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal;Yazdi, M (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Ctr Marine Technol & Ocean Engn CENTEC, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.;mohammad.yazdi@tecnico.ulisboa.pt;;;;;;57;47;48;2;31;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0925-7535;1879-1042;;SAFETY SCI;Saf.

Readers nowadays are deeply interested in how important an article is, its purpose and how influential it is in follow-up research work. Numerous techniques to tap the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence have been developed to enhance retrieval of the most influential scientific literature. In this paper, we compare and improve on four existing state-of-the-art techniques designed to identify influential citations. We consider 450 citations from the Association for Computational Linguistics corpus, classified by experts as either important or unimportant, and further extract 64 features based on the methodology of four state-of-the-art techniques. We apply the Extra-Trees classifier to select 29 best features and apply the Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers to all selected techniques. Using the Random Forest classifier, our supervised model improves on the state-of-the-art method by 11.25%, with 89% Precision-Recall area under the curve.

Agent-Based Models (ABMs) represent an effective research tool for CSS and consist of a class of models, which, aim to emulate or predict complex phenomena through a set of simple rules (i.e., independent actions, interactions and adaptation), performed by multiple agents. The efficiency and scalability of ABMs systems are typically obtained distributing the overall computation on several machines, which interact with each other in order to simulate a specific model. Unfortunately, the design of a distributed simulation model is particularly challenging, especially for domain experts who sporadically are computer scientists and are not used to developing parallel code. D-MASON framework is a distributed version of the MASON library for designing and executing ABMs in a distributed environment ensuring scalability and easiness. D-MASON enable the developer to exploit the computing power of distributed environment in a transparent manner; the developer has to do simple incremental modifications to existing MASON models, without re-designing them. This paper presents several novel features and architectural improvements introduced in the D-MASON framework: an improved space partitioning strategy, a distributed 3D field, a distributed network field, a decentralized communication layer, a novel memory consistency mechanism and the integration to cloud environments.";"[Cordasco, Gennaro] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dipartimento Psicol, Caserta, Italy; [Scarano, Vittorio; Spagnuolo, Carmine] Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Informat, Salerno, Italy";"Cordasco, G (corresponding author), Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dipartimento Psicol, Caserta, Italy.; Spagnuolo, C (corresponding author), Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Informat, Salerno, Italy.";"gennaro.cordasco@unicampania.it; vitsca@dia.unisa.it; cspagnuolo@unisa.it";"Spagnuolo, Carmine/AAP-6540-2020; Cordasco, Gennaro/AAQ-1930-2020; Cordasco, Gennaro/AAQ-1914-2020";"Cordasco, Gennaro/0000-0001-9148-9769; ";;;;53;4;4;1;12;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;1569-190X;1878-1462;;SIMUL MODEL PRACT TH;Simul.

The existing manual verifications are tedious, time-consuming, and prone to send wrong reports. Autoverification uses computer-based rules to verify clinical laboratory test results without manual review. To date, no data are available on the use of autoverification for ABG analysis. All autoverification rules were established according to AUTO10-A. Additionally, the rules were established using retrospective patient data, and then validated by actual clinical samples in a live environment before go-live. The average autoverification passing rate was 75.5%. The turnaround time (TAT) was reduced by 33.3% (27 min vs 18 min). Moreover, the error rate fell to 0.05% after implementation. Statistical analysis resulted in a kappa statistic of 0.92 (p < 0.01), indicating close agreement between autoverification and senior technician verification, and the chi-square value was 22.4 (p < 0.01), indicating that the autoverification error rate was lower than the manual verification error rate. Results showed that implementing autoverification rules with intelligent guidelines for ABG analysis of patients with critical illnesses could decrease the number of samples requiring manual verification, reduce TAT, and eliminate errors, allowing laboratorians to concentrate more time on abnormal samples, patient care, and collaboration with physicians.;"[Wu, Jie; Pan, Meichen; Ouyang, Huizhen; Yang, Zhili; Zhang, Qiaoxin; Cai, Yingmu] Shantou Univ, Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Clin Lab, Shantou 515041, Guangdong, Peoples R China";Cai, YM (corresponding author), Shantou Univ, Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Clin Lab, Shantou 515041, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;st_ymcai@163.com;;;;;;26;3;3;0;3;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;2472-6303;2472-6311;;SLAS TECHNOL;SLAS Technol.;DEC;2018;23;6;;;;;631;640;;10.1177/2472630318775311;;;10;"Biochemical Research Methods; Chemistry, Analytical";"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry";HD1QE;WOS:000452285600014;29787327;;;;2021-02-18;

Deploying a quantitative approach, we analyze 6600 scouting reports on a total of 1650 high school football athletes available online from four high-profile media outlets which offer 'expert' analyses of athletes' body characteristics, performance, and estimated potential. The findings indicate that subjective measurements of the athlete's body are the best predictors of hierarchical classification. The findings also indicate that objective measurements do not seem to predict the subjective assessment of those very athletic bodies. We argue that the evaluation of high school football athletes by so-called expert analysts is remarkably arbitrary, and thus call into question the very practice of football scouting that has become so dominant and influential.

The literature makes clear that PPI in health research encompasses a heterogeneous set of practices with levels of participation and involvement ranging from relatively minimal contributions to research processes to actively driving the research agenda. In this article, we draw on the work of Jurgen Habermas to explore the ways in which PPI was accomplished in a cancer research setting in England. Drawing on ethnographic data with PPI participants and professional researchers, we describe the ways in which the life-world experiences of PPI participants were shaped by the health research system. We argue that PPI in this setting is less about exploring differences with regard to a plurality of expertise and more about simply watching or supporting the professional researchers at work.;"[Bissell, Paul] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Human & Hlth Sci, Harold Wilson Bldg, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Thompson, Jill] Univ Sheffield, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Gibson, Barry] Univ Sheffield, Med Sociol, Sch Clin Dent, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England";Bissell, P (corresponding author), Univ Huddersfield, Sch Human & Hlth Sci, Harold Wilson Bldg, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England.;p.bissell@hud.ac.uk;;Gibson, Barry J/0000-0003-1413-4950;Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC);This study was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council through a doctoral training award, won by the second author.;;35;5;5;0;2;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0038-0385;1469-8684;;SOCIOLOGY;Sociol.-J.

People with varying cultural background and age, spanning the globe, share their views and day-to-day affairs with their community. There are an abundant number of internal applications as well as third-party applications (TPA) available to the users either through these OSN sites or that which uses the OSNs identity service to login and access the service. When users wish to use the TPA, the user's data has to be shared with the TPA's server. Otherwise, the service would be denied. When users share such information with the TPA, firstly, the users may not be aware of the reliability level of TPA and how those TPA would be handling the user's data. Secondly, they need not provide the promised level of service but still would have acquired the data from the users. Hence, it is necessary to check the TPA's level of service and the data requested by them before using the service. The reliability inference application (RIA) and application recommender proposed in this work are based on fuzzy inference mechanism. They mimic the human expert's decision of choosing a TPA. The RIA trades off the risk associated with sharing the data with the level of service offered and renders the reliability score of the applications. The application recommender presents the users with the recommendation for TPA as highly recommended, recommended or recommended with risk based on the user's privacy preference. It assists the user to choose a TPA that provides the desired level of service matching the user's privacy preferences.;"[Shanmuigapriya, T.; Swamynathan, S.] Anna Univ, Dept Informat Sci & Technol, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India";Shanmuigapriya, T (corresponding author), Anna Univ, Dept Informat Sci & Technol, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.;"shanmugapriyat@ssn.edu.in; swamyns@annauniv.edu";;;;;;17;2;2;1;5;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;1432-7643;1433-7479;;SOFT COMPUT;Soft Comput.;DEC;2018;22;24;;;;;8289;8300;;10.1007/s00500-017-2774-5;;;12;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications";Computer Science;GZ9DA;WOS:000449795600019;;;;;2021-02-18;

However, one thing that is still missing is the evaluation criteria that help software practitioners choose the right formal method for the problem at hand. In this paper, we present the criteria for evaluating and comparing different formal methods. The criteria were chosen through a literature review, discussions with experts from academia and practitioners from industry, and decade-long personal experience with the application of formal methods in industrial and academic projects. The criteria were then evaluated on several model-oriented state-based formal methods. Our research shows that besides technical grounds (eg, modeling capabilities and supported development phases), formal methods should also be evaluated from social and industrial perspectives. We also found out that it is not possible to generate a matrix that renders the selection of the right formal method an automatic process.

Therefore, there is a need for simulated laparoscopic models to acquire part-procedural competency prior to direct patient contact in a safe learning environment. For this reason, we chose two paediatric conditions; inguinal hernia (IH) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), which were combined to create the laparoscopic inguinal and diaphragmatic defect (LIDD) model. Our aim was to assess this novel surgical simulation model by determining its construct and content validity.MethodsA total of 107 participants completed the validation study: volunteer medical students (novices), surgical trainees (intermediate) and consultant surgeons (experts). Basic demographic data were collected. Subjects were shown a pre-recorded video of both exercises. The assessment exercise involved closing both the simulated inguinal or diaphragmatic hernial orifice. The task was assessed using a novel scoring system with a maximum score of 21 for IH model and 15 for the CDH. The content validity was assessed by a 6-point Likert scale of the expert group.Results105/107 participants successfully completed the two exercises. Both aspects of the LIDD model revealed a statistical significance between the scores obtained by the three groups of subjects. Experts scored 20.3/21 for the IH and 14.8/15 for the CDH models which significantly higher than medical students (6.3/21 and 5.3/15; p<0.05 for both) and trainees (11.2/21 and 9.3/15; p<0.05 for both). Similarly, trainees performed significantly better than medical students in both models (p<0.05). Therefore, the LIDD model was found to have a good construct validity. It was, however, unable to differentiate between the various levels of trainees in the intermediate group. Content validity from the experts revealed that there was a high score for the potential of both aspects of LIDD (4.8 and 4.8). There was also a high level of functional fidelity for task completion (4.0 and 4.0).ConclusionsWe have demonstrated both the construct and content validity of the LIDD model for both laparoscopic IH and CDH repair.

As the resources for maintenance are limited, optimization is necessary. A number of conflicting objectives exist with many influencing variables. Although many methods have been proposed, the related research is very active, due to difficulties in adoption to the actual practice owing to reasons such high-dimensional problems even for small road networks. Literature survey tells that particle swarms have not been exploited much, mainly due to unavailability of many techniques in this domain for multi-objective discrete problems like this. In this work, a novel particle swarm algorithm is proposed for a general, discrete, multi-objective problem. In contrast to the standard particle swarm, the bare-bones technique has a clear advantage in that it is a parameter-free technique, hence the end users need not be optimization experts. However, the existing barebones algorithm is available only for continuous domains, sans any particle velocity terms. For discrete domains, the proposed method introduces a parameter-free velocity term to the standard bare-bones algorithm. Based on the peak velocities observed by the different dimensions of a particle, its new position is calculated. A number of benchmark test functions are also solved. The results show that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive and able to obtain much better spread of solutions compared to three other existing PSO and genetic algorithms. The method is benchmarked against a number of other algorithms on an actual pavement maintenance problem. When compared against another particle swarm algorithm, it not only shows better performance, but also significant reduction in run-time compared to other POS algorithm. Hence, for large road network maintenance, the proposed method shows a lot of promise in terms of analysis time, while improving on the quality of solutions.;"[Mahmood, Maher] Univ Anbar, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Ramadi, Iraq; [Mathavan, Senthan] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Architecture Design & Built Environm, Nottingham, England; [Rahman, Mujib] Brunel Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Uxbridge, Middx, England";Mahmood, M (corresponding author), Univ Anbar, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Ramadi, Iraq.;maher.mahmood@uoanbar.edu.iq;"Mahmood, Maher/M-4139-2016; Mathavan, Senthan/J-8553-2013";"Mahmood, Maher/0000-0002-9880-2348; Mathavan, Senthan/0000-0001-7003-2874";;;;83;2;2;1;15;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;2210-6502;2210-6510;;SWARM EVOL COMPUT;Swarm Evol.

Surveillance evaluation should be an integral part of the surveillance life cycle, as it provides a means to identify and correct problems and to sustain and enhance the existing strengths of a surveillance system. The surveillance evaluation Framework (SurF) presented here was developed to provide a generic framework within which the MPI biosecurity surveillance portfolio, and all of its components, can be consistently assessed. SurF is an innovative, cross-sectoral effort that aims to provide a common umbrella for surveillance evaluation in the animal, plant, environment and aquatic sectors. It supports the conduct of the following four distinct components of an evaluation project: (i) motivation for the evaluation, (ii) scope of the evaluation, (iii) evaluation design and implementation and (iv) reporting and communication of evaluation outputs. Case studies, prepared by MPI subject matter experts, are included in the framework to guide users in their assessment. Three case studies were used in the development of SurF in order to assure practical utility and to confirm usability of SurF across all included sectors. It is anticipated that the structured approach and information provided by SurF will not only be of benefit to MPI but also to other New Zealand stakeholders. Although SurF was developed for internal use by MPI, it could be applied to any surveillance system in New Zealand or elsewhere.;"[Muellner, Petra] Epi Interact, Wellington, New Zealand; [Watts, Jonathan; Bingham, Paul; Bullians, Mark; Gould, Brendan; Pande, Anjali; Riding, Tim; Stevens, Paul; Vink, Daan] Minist Primary Ind, Wellington, New Zealand; [Staerk, Katharina D.

Wetlands play a critical role in regional sustainable development because of their ability to enhance resilienceagainst extreme weather events. Maintaining coastal sustainability requires consideration of both the health of coastal wetlands and the resilience of urban systems while mitigating the conflict among social, economic, and environmental goals in land usages around coastal wetland environment. This study investigates a sensitive coastal wetland system located at central Taiwan for demonstration of a sustainable planning practice with an integrated model based on network topology in a socio-ecological context. There are two parts of the integrated model. Whereas a Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model helps delineate the complex behaviors among different stakeholders by identifying various indicators, the analytic network process (ANP) quantifies the network topology of DPSIR. According to the survey via questionnaires answered by a group of experts, the DPSIR model is composed of 32 major indicators that can be networked by ANP. The results reveal that an effective ecological conservation depends on a series of mitigation actions, including river and habitat restorations, pollution control, green tourism, and integrated community development via better zoning policies.;"[Chuang, Yen Hsun; Chen, Wei Yea; Chen, Ho Wen; Su, Yu Ting] Tunghai Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Taichung, Taiwan; [Yu, Ruey Fang] Natl United Univ, Dept Safety Hlth & Environm Engn, Miaoli, Taiwan";Chen, HW (corresponding author), Tunghai Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Taichung, Taiwan.;"d01340002@thu.edu.tw; rfyu@thu.edu.tw; wychen@thu.edu.tw; hwchen@thu.edu.tw; juting326@gmail.com";;;Urban and Rural Development Branch, Construction and Planning Agency, Ministry of the Interior [UR-10228];The authors would like to thank the Urban and Rural Development Branch, Construction and Planning Agency, Ministry of the Interiorfor financially supporting this research under Contract No. UR-10228.;;58;2;2;5;62;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0923-4861;1572-9834;;WETL ECOL MANAG;Wetl.

The imaging criteria for diagnosing CTEPH relied on at least one segmental triangular perfusion defect on DECT perfusion studies and V/Q mismatch on scintigraphy examinations.ResultsBased on multidisciplinary expert decisions that did not include DECT perfusion, 36 patients were diagnosed with CTEPH and 44 patients with other aetiologies of PH. On DECT perfusion studies, there were 35 true positives, 6 false positives and 1 false negative (sensitivity 0.97, specificity 0.86, PPV 0.85, NPV 0.97). On V/Q scans, there were 35 true positives and 1 false negative (sensitivity 0.97, specificity 1, PPV 1, NPV 0.98). There was excellent agreement between CT perfusion and scintigraphy in diagnosing CTEPH (kappa value 0.80). Combined information from DECT perfusion and CT angiographic images enabled correct reclassification of the 6 false positives and the unique false negative case of DECT perfusion.ConclusionThere is excellent agreement between DECT perfusion and V/Q scintigraphy in diagnosing CTEPH.

The specification of the vulnerability characteristics is a crucial procedure, since the characteristics are used as input for a plethora of vulnerability scoring systems. Currently, the determination of the specific characteristics-that represent each vulnerability-is a process that is performed manually by the IT security experts. However, the vulnerability description can be very informative and useful to predict vulnerability characteristics. The primary goal of this research is the enhancement, the acceleration and the support of the manual procedure of the vulnerability characteristic assignment. To achieve this goal, a model, which combines texts analysis and multi -target classification techniques was developed. This model estimates the vulnerability characteristics and subsequently, calculates the vulnerability severity scores from the predicted characteristics. To perform the present research, a dataset that contains 99,091 records from a large -publicly available vulnerability database was used. The results are encouraging, since they show accuracy in the prediction of the vulnerability characteristics and scores. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To this end, we collected data from 12 students in the 9th grade in a high school in Turkey. The data collection took place in two sessions of an English Course. While the students were reading articles and solving relevant questions, our data collection application running in the background recorded the videos of the individual students through a camera and captured students' screens in a non-intrusive manner. In total, we had 12.5h of student data. We employed the human expert labeling process (HELP) (Aslan et al. in Workshop proceedings at international conference on intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), pp 156-165, 2016) to have the data labeled (150h of data labeling in total). The data collection application was designed in a way that it also collected emotional self-labels (i.e., emotional states as self-reported by students at any time of learning). We leveraged emotional self-label information to suggest various real-time interventions for the students. The results obtained using the final expert labels showed that the percentage of the students' Satisfied state was significantly higher after interventions. The results also demonstrated that although the interventions were triggered by the emotional states as self-labeled by the students and tailored to improve such states, there was a major positive impact of these interventions on students' behavioral states. This preliminary study showed that even with a limited set of emotion-aware interventions based on self-labels, students' states could be impacted positively.

This paper focusses on the realisation stage of a design process, specifically when conceptual ideas are being externalised through CAD. Acknowledging students as novices or quasi-experts with regards to their levels of technical expertise and recognising the limitations in the cognitive capacities of humans suggests merit in investigating problem solving strategies through the lens of heuristics. A comparative study was employed between two distinct CAD systems to examine students modelling behaviour.

The objectives of this study were to describe the diverse management of cull dairy cows in Canada and establish consensus on ways to achieve improvements. A 2-day expert consultation meeting was convened, involving farmers, veterinarians, regulators, and experts in animal transport, livestock auction, and slaughter. The 15 participants, recruited from across Canada, discussed regional management practices for cull cattle, related risk factors, animal welfare problems, and recommendations. An audio recording of the meeting was used to extract descriptive data on cull cattle management and identify points of agreement. Eight consensus points were reached: (1) to assemble information on travel times and delays from farm to slaughter; (2) to increase awareness among producers and herd veterinarians of potential travel distances and delays; (3) to promote pro-active culling; (4) to improve the ability of personnel to assess animal condition before loading; (5) to identify local options for slaughter of cull dairy cows; (6) to investigate different management options such as emergency slaughter and mobile slaughter; (7) to ensure that all farms and auctions have, or can access, personnel trained and equipped for euthanasia; and (8) to promote cooperation among enforcement agencies and wider adoption of beneficial regulatory options.";"[Stojkov, J.; Fraser, D.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Anim Welf Program, 2357 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Bowers, G.; Sillett, N.] Dairy Farmers Canada, 21 Florence St, Ottawa, ON K2P 0W6, Canada; [Draper, M.] Ontario Minist Agr Food & Rural Affairs, 1 Stone Rd West, Guelph, ON N1G 4Y2, Canada; [Duffield, T.] Univ Guelph, Ontario Vet Coll, 50 Stone Rd E, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Duivenvoorden, P.] Headline Holsteins Ltd, 191 Goose Arm Rd, Deer Lake, NF A8A 3H9, Canada; [Groleau, M.] Canadian Food Inspect Agcy, 59 Camelot Dr, Ottawa, ON K1A 0Y9, Canada; [Haupstein, D.] Saskatchewan Milk Mkt Board, 444 McLeod St, Regina, SK S4N 4Y1, Canada; [Peters, R.] Steves Livestock Transport Ltd, 214 Ctr Ave, Blumenort, MB R0A 0C0, Canada; [Pritchard, J.] Minist Agr, 1767 Angus Campbell Rd, Abbotsford, BC V3G 2M3, Canada; [Radom, C.] Canadian Assoc Bovine Vet, 226E Wheeler St, Saskatoon, SK S7P 0A9, Canada; [Skippon, W.] Saputo Inc, 6869 Metropolitain Est, Montreal, PQ H1P 1X8, Canada; [Trepanier, H.] Minist Agr Pecheries & Alimentat Quebec, 200 Chemin St Foy, Ville De Quebec, PQ G1R 4X6, Canada";Stojkov, J (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Anim Welf Program, 2357 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.;stojkov@mail.ubc.ca;Duffield, Todd/Q-9425-2019;Duffield, Todd/0000-0001-6035-4669;"Loblaw Companies Limited (Brampton, ON, Canada); National Farmed Animal Health and Welfare Council (Bluevale, ON, Canada); NSERC Industrial Research Chair ProgramCanada Research Chairs";We are grateful to Loblaw Companies Limited (Brampton, ON, Canada) for funding, and to the National Farmed Animal Health and Welfare Council (Bluevale, ON, Canada) for sponsoring the expert consultation.

Given the increasing popularity of these devices, their high processing power, and the ability to transfer data over wireless networks, different smartphone-based applications have emerged in the last years to solve old problems with new approaches more efficiently and cheaply. One example is the assessment and monitoring of asphalt quality. This task has been done manually by experts since the 1930s, and with the help of expensive equipment since the 1960s. Currently, we are experiencing the emergence of next-generation tools to perform this monitoring with smartphones, significantly reducing costs, time, and effort of experts. However, there is a trade-off between the costs and precision of smartphone sensors, requiring the use of sophisticated software solutions. In this paper, we propose Asfault, a low-cost system to evaluate and monitor road pavement conditions in real-time using smartphone sensors and machine learning algorithms. The system is composed of an Android application responsible for doing automatic evaluations and a web application that aims to show the evaluations in an informative way. We propose to employ accelerometer sensors to measure the vehicle vibration while driving and use this data to evaluate the pavement conditions. Asfault achieves a classification performance superior to 90% in a 5-class problem considering the following road qualities: Good, Average, Fair, and Poor, as well the occurrence of obstacles in the road. Our system is publicly available for use and could be useful for practitioners responsible for urban and highway maintenance, as well for regular drivers in the planning of better routes based on the pavement quality and comfort of the travel.

The challenges are then to integrate each domain's tools (formalism and simulation software) within the rigorous framework of M&S process. To answer this issue, we give the specifications of the Multi-agent Environment for Complex-SYstem CO-simulation (MECSYCO) middleware which enables to interconnect several pre-existing and heterogeneous M&S tools, so they can simulate a whole CPS together. The middleware performs the co-simulation in a parallel, decentralized, and distributable fashion thanks to its modular multi-agent architecture. In order to rigorously integrate tools that use different formalisms, the co-simulation engine of MECSYCO is based on the discrete event system specification (DEVS). The central idea of MECSYCO is to use a DEVS wrapping strategy to integrate each tool into the middleware. Thus, heterogeneous tools can be homogeneously co-simulated in the form of a DEVS system. By using DEVS, MECSYCO benefits from the numerous scientific works which have demonstrated the integrative power of this formalism and give crucial guidelines to rigorously design wrappers. We demonstrate that our discrete framework can integrate a vast amount of continuous M&S tools by wrapping the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) standard. To this end, we take advantage of DEVS efforts of the literature (namely, the DEV&DESS hybrid formalism and Quantized State System (QSS) solvers) to design DEVS wrappers for Functional Mockup Unit (FMU) components. As a side-effect, this wrapping is not restricted to MECSYCO but can be applied in any DEVS-based platform. We evaluate MECSYCO with the proof of concept of a smart heating use case, where we co-simulate non-DEVS-centric M&S tools.;"[Camus, Benjamin; Paris, Thomas; Vaubourg, Julien; Bourjot, Christine; Ciarletta, Laurent; Chevrier, Vincent] Univ Lorraine, CNRS, INRIA, LORIA,UMR 7503, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Presse, Yannick] INRIA, F-54600 Villers Les Nancy, France";Camus, B (corresponding author), IRISA, Campus Beaulieu 263 Ave Gen Leclerc, F-35042 Rennes, France.;benjamin.camus@loria.fr;;;EDF R&D through the strategic project MS4SG;This work was partially funded by EDF R&D through the strategic project MS4SG.;;58;5;5;1;15;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;0037-5497;1741-3133;;SIMUL-T SOC MOD SIM;Simul.-Trans.

The present study aimed to investigate determinant competencies of emerging educators' entrepreneurial behavior in the Institute of Agricultural Applied Scientific Education (IAASE). The research was an applied and descriptive correlation study carried out through a survey. The population of the study was composed of 190 faculty members in IAASE in Tehran, Fars, Semnan, Isfahan and Khorasan Razavi provinces, Iran. Using Krejcie and Morgan's (Educ Psychol Meas 30:607-610, 1970) table and proportional to size stratified random sampling method, 123 faculty members were selected as research sample (n = 123). The data collecting tool was a questionnaire whose validity was confirmed by a panel of six experts and its reliability was determined by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficients for different sections between 0.71 and 0.93. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18 was used for data analysis. The results of correlation between variables showed a positive and significant relationship between career adaptability, networking skill, occupational self-efficacy, creative thinking, and entrepreneurship climate with educators' entrepreneurial behavior. In addition, the results of hierarchical multiple regression showed that entrepreneurship climate variable was able to adjust the relation between networking skill and career adaptability with educators entrepreneurial behavior. In other words, the educators with highly networking and occupational adaptability skills, in ideal situations, show more entrepreneurial behavior.

METHODS The convex framework is based on the precomputation of a dictionary composed of the individual dose distributions of all possible shots, considering all their possible locations, sizes, and shapes inside the target volume. The convex problem is solved to determine the plan, i.e., which shots and with which weights, that will actually be used, considering a sparsity constraint on the shots to fulfill the constraints while minimizing the beam-on time. The system is called IntuitivePlan and allows data to be transferred from generated dose plans into the Gamma Knife treatment planning software for further dosimetry evaluation. RESULTS The system has been very efficiently implemented, and an optimal plan is usually obtained in less than 1 to 2 minutes, depending on the complexity of the problem, on a desktop computer or in only a few minutes on a high-end laptop. Dosimetry data from 5 cases, 2 meningiomas and 3 vestibular schwannomas, were generated with IntuitivePlan. Results of evaluation of the dosimetry characteristics are very satisfactory and adequate in terms of conformity, selectivity, gradient, protection of organs at risk, and treatment time. CONCLUSIONS The possibility of using optimal, interactive real-time inverse planning in conjunction with the Leksell Gamma Knife opens new perspectives in radiosurgery, especially considering the potential use of the full capabilities of the latest generations of the Leksell Gamma Knife. This approach gives new users the possibility of using the system for easier and quicker access to good-quality plans with a shorter technical training period and opens avenues for new planning strategies for expert users. The use of a convex optimization approach allows an optimal plan to be provided in a very short processing time. This way, innovative graphical user interfaces can be developed, allowing the user to interact directly with the planning system to graphically define the desired dose map and to modify on-the-fly the dose map by moving, in a very user-friendly manner, the isodose surfaces of an initial plan. Further independent quantitative prospective evaluation comparing inverse planned and forward planned cases is warranted to validate this novel and promising treatment planning approach.;"[Levivier, Marc] Lausanne Univ Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Levivier, Marc] Lausanne Univ Hosp, Gamma Knife Ctr, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Carrillo, Rafael E.; Thiran, Jean-Philippe] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Signal Proc Lab LTS5, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Carrillo, Rafael E.] CSEM SA, Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Charrier, Remi; Martin, Andre] Intuit Therapeut SA, St Sulpice, Switzerland";"Levivier, M (corresponding author), Lausanne Univ Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Levivier, M (corresponding author), Lausanne Univ Hosp, Gamma Knife Ctr, Lausanne, Switzerland.";marc.levivier@chuv.ch;;;;;;19;5;5;0;0;AMER ASSOC NEUROLOGICAL SURGEONS;ROLLING MEADOWS;5550 MEADOWBROOK DRIVE, ROLLING MEADOWS, IL 60008 USA;0022-3085;1933-0693;;J NEUROSURG;J.

Since 2014, new studies have been published concerning new sedative agents or new insights into the pattern/levels of the obstruction depending on the depth of sedation. Therefore, an enlarged group of European experts in the field of sleep breathing disorders (SBD), including the most of the first DISE EPP main authors, has decided to publish an update of the European position paper on DISE, in order to include new evidence and to find a common language useful for reporting the findings of this endoscopic evaluation in adult population affected by SBD. Methods The authors have evaluated all the available evidence reported in the literature and have compared experience among various departments in leading European centres in order to provide an update regarding the standardisation of the DISE procedure and an in-depth insight into the main aspects of this technique. Results After the first European Position Consensus Meeting on DISE and its update, consensus was confirmed for indications, required preliminary examinations, where to perform DISE, technical equipment required, staffing, local anaesthesia, nasal decongestion, other medications, patient positioning, basics and special diagnostic manoeuvres, drugs and observation windows. So far, no consensus could be reached on a scoring and classification system. However, regarding this aim, the idea of an essential classification, such as VOTE with the possibility of its graded implementation of information and descriptions, seems to be the best way to reach a universal consensus on DISE classification at this stage. A common DISE language is mandatory, and attempts to come to a generally accepted system should be pursued.;"[De Vito, Andrea] Morgagni Pierantoni Hosp, ENT & Oral Surg Unit, Head & Neck Dept, Forli, Italy; [De Vito, Andrea] Ravenna AUSL Romagna, Santa Maria Croci Hosp, ENT Unit, Romagna, Italy; [Carrasco Llatas, Marina] Hosp Univ Doctor Peset, ENT Clin, Valencia, Spain; [Ravesloot, Madeline J.; Vonk, Patty Elisabeth] OLVG, Dept Otorhinolaryngol & Head & Neck Surg, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ravesloot, Madeline J.] Med Centrum Jan van Goyen, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kotecha, Bhik] UCLH, Royal Natl Throat Nose & Ear Hosp, London, England; [De Vries, Nico] OLVG Hosp, Dept Otolaryngol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [De Vries, Nico] ACTA, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [De Vries, Nico] Univ Antwerp, Multidisciplinary Sleep Disorders Ctr, Dept Otorhinolaryngol & Head & Neck Surg, Antwerp, Belgium; [De Vries, Nico] MOVE Inst, Acad Ctr Dent, Dept Oral Kinesiol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hamans, Evert] ZNA, Jan Palfijn Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Antwerp, Belgium; [Maurer, Joachim] Univ Med Mannheim, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Sleep Disorders Ctr, Mannheim, Germany; [Bosi, Marcello] AUSL Romagna, Morgagni Pierantoni Hosp, Dept Thorac Dis, Pulm Operat Unit, Forli, Italy; [Blumen, Marc] Suresnes France & Ctr Med Veille Sommeil, Hop Foch, Serv ORL, Paris, France; [Heiser, Clemens] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Munich, Germany; [Herzog, Michael] Carl Thiem Klinikum, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Cottbus, Germany; [Montevecchi, Filippo] AUSL Romagna, Morgagni Pierantoni Hosp, ENT & Oral Surg Unit, Head & Neck Dept, Forli, Italy; [Corso, Ruggero Massimo] AUSL Romagna, Morgagni Pierantoni Hosp, Intens Care Unit, Forli, Italy; [Braghiroli, Alberto] IRCCS, SPA SB, Ist Clin Sci Maugeri, Sleep Lab,Pulm Rehabil Dept, Veruno, Italy; [Gobbi, Riccardo] Morgagni Pierantoni Hosp, ENT & Oral Surg Unit, Head & Neck Dept, Forli, Italy; [Vroegop, Anneclaire] Antwerp Univ Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Edegem, Belgium; [Hohenhorst, Winfried] Alfried Krupp Hosp, ENT Head & Neck Surg, Essen, Germany; [Piccin, Ottavio; Sorrenti, Giovanni] St Orsola Malpighi Univ Hosp, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Bologna, Italy; [Vanderveken, Olivier M.] Univ Antwerp, Multidisciplinary Sleep Disorders Ctr, Dept ENT Head & Neck Surg, Antwerp Univ Hosp,Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Antwerp, Belgium; [Vicini, Claudio] Morgagni Pierantoni Hosp, ENT & Oral Surg Unit, AUSL Romagna, Head & Neck Dept, Forli, Italy; [Vicini, Claudio] AUSL Romagna, Infermi Hosp, ENT Unit, Faenza, Italy; [Vicini, Claudio] Santa Maria Croci Hosp, ENT Unit, Ravenna, Italy; [Vicini, Claudio] AUSL Romagna, Romagna, Italy; [Vicini, Claudio] Univ Ferrara, ENT Clin, Ferrara, Italy";Vito, A (corresponding author), Morgagni Pierantoni Hosp, ENT & Oral Surg Unit, Head & Neck Dept, Forli, Italy.;dr.andrea.devito@gmail.com;"Carrasco, Marina/H-3455-2019; Corso, Ruggero/AAA-3942-2020; Piccin, Ottavio/B-7748-2013; Piccin, Ottavio/N-9621-2019; Montevecchi, Filippo/ABC-7691-2020; Heiser, Clemens/AAG-9446-2020; De Vito, Andrea/I-1311-2019; Gobbi, Riccardo/AAQ-1757-2020";"Carrasco, Marina/0000-0003-0849-5901; Corso, Ruggero/0000-0001-5446-6314; Piccin, Ottavio/0000-0002-0184-7460; Piccin, Ottavio/0000-0002-0184-7460; Heiser, Clemens/0000-0001-6301-2891; De Vito, Andrea/0000-0002-9802-7716; sorrenti, giovanni/0000-0002-3240-1058";;;;80;48;47;1;4;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1749-4478;1749-4486;;CLIN OTOLARYNGOL;Clin.

Methods Results A combination of Cariology and Psychology experts developed a 79-item pool that measured the COM-B components according to the ICCMS (TM) caries management recommended behaviours. After face and content validation and a pilot study, two samples of Colombian dentists participated: clinicians (n = 277) and clinical-practice educators (n = 212). Using parallel analysis and exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM), the questionnaire was reduced to a 47-item 5-factor instrument that demonstrated good internal consistency and validity properties, including a robust factor structure, measurement invariance across samples and high predictive validity of ICCMS (TM) recommended behaviours. Scales' mean scores showed that dentists were conducting recommended behaviours most-of-the-time (Behavior), showed high confidence in their ability to conduct these behaviours (Capability) and considered recommendations as highly relevant (Opportunity-Relevance), while their appraisals of the available resources (Opportunity-Resources) and remuneration (Motivation) were notably lower. Conclusion Overall, the findings highlight the practical utility of the COM-B ICCMS (TM) Questionnaire in understanding the potential antecedent variables that may explain dentists' behaviours related to caries diagnosis and management and in suggesting avenues for achieving a positive change in their behaviour.;"[Abreu-Placeres, Ninoska; Avila, Viviana; Martignon, Stefania] Univ El Bosque, UNICA Caries Res Unit, Bogota, Colombia; [Abreu-Placeres, Ninoska] Univ Iberoamer, Acad Res Dept, Biomat & Dent Res Ctr CIBO UNIBE, Santo Domingo, Dominican Rep; [Newton, Johnathon Timothy] Kings Coll London, Social & Behav Sci, Dent Inst, London, England; [Pitts, Nigel; Martignon, Stefania] Kings Coll London, Dent Innovat & Translat Ctr, Dent Inst, London, England; [Garrido, Luis Eduardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Madre & Maestra, Invest & Innovac, Santo Domingo, Dominican Rep; [Garrido, Luis Eduardo] Univ Virginia, Dept Psychol, Gilmer Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Ekstrand, Kim R.] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Hlth & Med Sci, Sch Dent, Sect Cariol & Endodont, Copenhagen, Denmark";Martignon, S (corresponding author), Univ El Bosque, UNICA Caries Res Unit, Bogota, Colombia.;martignonstefania@unbosque.edu.co;Garrido, Luis Eduardo/K-6234-2017;"Garrido, Luis Eduardo/0000-0001-8932-6063; Ekstrand, Kim/0000-0002-2356-4349";;;;28;3;3;2;10;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0301-5661;1600-0528;;COMMUNITY DENT ORAL;Community Dentist.

In this study, a stepwise approach of developing a glioma module for assessment of symptoms, based on a Dutch adapted and validated version of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, is described. Methods: Three phases of instrument development were conducted: a systematic literature review and a focus group interview with experts were performed (phase I) to generate relevant symptoms and construct a preliminary module (phase II). In phase III, the preliminary module was evaluated (n = 25) and pretested (n = 45) in glioma patients representing all phases of the disease. Results: Our glioma module contains 11 generic and 6 neurologic symptoms. Patients completed the glioma module in a median of 5 minutes, and 56% of the patients required some assistance to complete the instrument. Conclusion: The glioma module has initial validity and will benefit from prospective validation in a larger cohort of patients with glioma.;"[Ijzerman-Korevaar, Margriet; de Graeff, Alexander; De Vos, Filip Y.

A large database of pressure points was collected and analyzed using many multiphase flow correlations. The expert system was developed with a set of rules to identify the best correlation for variety of well, flow, and PVT conditions. The expert system is based on the idea of clustering the data and finding the best multiphase flow correlation(s) for each cluster. The error associated with the selected correlation is also quantified for every correlation in each data sub-cluster so the engineer would expect the accuracy of pressure drop prediction when utilizing this approach. Over the entire database, if one multiphase flow correlation is selected, the overall mean absolute percent error ranges between 12.7 and 57.5%, while the range of errors for best correlation(s) in different data sub-clusters range from 0.01 to 3% for most cases with accurate PVT. The expert system was validated by a new set of data. It succeeded in identifying the best correlation(s) 70% of the times, and the calculated pressure was more accurate than using one correlation by a factor of 2. Use of the expert system in the validation database gave a mean absolute percent error of 8.8%. This represents approximately one-third of the error value when any single correlation is used over the entire validation dataset.

Recently, an intravitreal formulation of sirolimus, an immunosuppressant that inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin, a key regulator of cell growth in the immune system, was developed. On the basis of this mechanism and the local method of delivery, it was hypothesized that intravitreal sirolimus can improve ocular inflammation in patients with noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis, with minimal systemic exposure and systemic adverse events (AEs). This review summarizes the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety results of intravitreal sirolimus from 3 preclinical studies and 4 phase 1e3 clinical studies. Preclinical studies in rabbits showed that 22 to 220 mg intravitreal sirolimus results in sustained release of sirolimus in the vitreous for 2 months ormore, with systemic concentrations below the threshold for systemic immunosuppression (approximately 8 ng/ml). Subsequently, 2 phase 1 studies (n = 50 and n = 30) established that intravitreal sirolimus improves ocular inflammation in humans. Further investigation in phase 2 and 3 studies (n = 24 and n = 347, respectively) suggested that 440 mg has the best benefit-to-risk profile. In the phase 3 study, the proportion of patients who showed complete resolution of ocular inflammation at month 5 was significantly higher in the 440-mg group than in the 44-mg group (22.8% vs. 10.3%; P = 0.025, Fisher exact test). In addition, 47 of 69 patients (68.1%) who were treated with systemic corticosteroids at baseline discontinued corticosteroid use at month 5. No sirolimus-related systemic AEs were reported in phase 1-3 studies. Collectively, these preclinical and clinical study data of intravitreal sirolimus support the therapeutic rationale of treating noninfectious uveitis with a local mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor and suggest that 440 mg intravitreal sirolimus has the potential to be an effective and well-tolerated anti-inflammatory and corticosteroid-sparing treatment for noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis.

Therefore, to enhance the detection precision and diminishing the time factor, an automatic classification system for leukocytes has been proposed. In routine clinical practice, expert hematologists observed that the nucleus plays a crucial role in the identification of the blood disorders. Accordingly, in this work, the localization of leukocyte nucleus is performed by using Chan-Vase level-set method for the design of a classification framework that differentiates between four classes of the leukocytes, i.e., eosinophils, polymorphs, monocytes and lymphocytes based on the nucleus. A dataset consisting of 162 leukocyte microscopic images is used. The images in the dataset are classified on the basis of texture, shape and color features. The feature selection method based on the linguistic hedge is applied on evaluated feature space of 92. The selected features are fed to an adaptive neuro-fuzzy classifier for the classification. The proposed framework obtained an accuracy of 98.7% after applying the adaptive neuro-fuzzy classification on selected 46 informative features. The correlation of best features and data extorted from the different microscopic images may yield a dramatic increase in diagnostic consistency in clinical pathology. The results obtained by utilization of selected optimal features and adaptive neuro-fuzzy classification system indicate that it can be routinely used in clinical environment for differential diagnosis between different classes of leukocytes.;"[Rawat, Jyoti; Singh, Annapurna; Bhadauria, H.

This enhancement contains an adaptation of the original CommonKADS methodology and utilization of service-oriented architecture (SOA) as a promising software engineering technology. The proposed adaptation model includes two alternative processes: adjusting and converting. An adjusting process performs a transformation of the existing CommonKADS layers to be SOA-enabled so that it includes representing the data in a new standard form to be transformed into set of services. Converting process is concerned with changing CommonKADS-based legacy systems to SOA-enabled systems through using GenericSOA framework.

However, the nature of conflicts and requirements uncertainty have limited exploratory power with regard to software team effectiveness. The main objective of this work is to obtain additional insight into this phenomena by examining the relationships between requirements uncertainty (which comprises both requirements instability and variability) and conflict (i.e. task and relationship conflict). Furthermore, the impact of task and relationship conflict on team effectiveness has also been investigated separately. In order to address these relationships, a theoretical research model was developed and validated through an empirical study based on an online questionnaire survey. We gathered 71 complete responses, mostly from experts within the Indian software industry. The findings of this study indicate that there is a strong positive relationship between requirements instability and variability and relationship conflict; however, task conflict task conflict was not found to have a significant relationship with these dimensions.

Survey and administrative data were collected from 26 interdisciplinary mental health teams. Study Design Data Collection Methods The study used a longitudinal, observational design. Independent variables were measured at baseline, 6, and 12 months: expertise redundancy (the extent to which team members possess highly overlapping knowledge), TM accuracy (the extent to which team members accurately recognize experts in relevant knowledge domains), and TM consensus (the extent to which team members agree on who is expert in which knowledge domain). Team performance was measured as risk-adjusted average number of client hospitalization for the 6 months following each survey. Survey data were collected by the authors. Administrative data were collected by the state's administrative agency. Principal Findings Conclusions Expertise redundancy had a negative effect on performance. TM accuracy had a positive effect on performance, and such effect was stronger when expertise redundancy was higher. No significant effect was found on TM consensus.

Before the crisis happens, this system can provide effective information by using known resources, which creates an awareness of probable dangers and necessary actions. This study proposes an optimal method to cover the shortages in protected-area management. The proposed early-warning system is based on the pressure-state-response (P-S-R) approach and ecological security index. Twelve environmental indicators in three different criteria (P = 4, S = 5, R = 3) were chosen and the ecological security index of the protected area was generated. Based on the ecological security index status in the study area, statistical analysis, and expert opinions, three indicators (precipitation, vegetation covering status, and soil brightness) were chosen as the main and final indicators, to be used in the early-warning system. Eventually, with the calculation of the thirty-year average of the mentioned indicators in the area under study, the confidence interval for each of these indicators with a confidence factor of 95% was achieved. According to the results of this research, some parts of the south-west and east of the area under study were in warning status, which requires special management decisions. Based on the field visit and expert review in these parts, there was an obvious breakdown in the selected indicators. In fact, we've prevented the ecological disturbance in the ecosystem which plays an important role in preserving species of international importance by using technologies. We've made a shortcut to achieve the managerial goals in less developed countries in further studies in this field; the importance of each early-warning system indicator can be determined, so warning regions can be divided into more categories. This research can be applied in other climates, and the result can be compared to this paper, but the choice of general and effective indicators remains the most important part of the approach reported here.";"[Bahraminejad, Meysam; Rayegani, Behzad; Jahani, Ali; Nezami, Bagher] Coll Environm, Dept Environm, Karaj, Iran";Rayegani, B (corresponding author), Coll Environm, Dept Environm, Karaj, Iran.;behzad.rayegani@gmail.com;Jahani, Ali/L-4850-2019;"Jahani, Ali/0000-0003-4965-3291; Rayegani, Behzad/0000-0002-6169-0602";;;;32;11;12;2;22;ELSEVIER GMBH, URBAN & FISCHER VERLAG;JENA;OFFICE JENA, P O BOX 100537, 07705 JENA, GERMANY;1617-1381;1618-1093;;J NAT CONSERV;J.

A credit scoring system for validation of the customers is developed based on applied regression model. Then a Newton-Raphson method is used for determining the coefficients of regression model. Furthermore the MacFadden statistical value is calculated for approving the regression model. A case study is presented for application of proposed model. Three factors of sponsor's job, applicant's jobs and income are extracted as the main factors which are affecting the customer validation in the case. The result of the proposed model based on the case study showed that using a regression model which is empowered by Delphi system can provide a robust model for validation of the customers for deciding on granting to the customers.;"[Ershadi, M.

The study contained two parts: survey development and Delphi survey. First, a small sample test was conducted to check the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. Next, this questionnaire was applied to investigate adult cancer patients' needs for death education. Then, we invited experts in the fields of nursing management, clinical medicine, clinical nursing and psychological care to carry out two rounds of Delphi consultations to revise the training content. Background Design Death education is often combined with hospice care, which is based on a clear 6-month survival period. However, the survival of adult cancer patients has improved with improved cancer diagnoses and treatments, and death education should be initiated before the dying stage. At the same time, patients' needs for medical information become increasingly important in daily clinical practice. Therefore, a death education programme based on adult cancer patients' needs was developed to help these patients reflect on the meanings of life and death. A mixed methods study. Methods Results During the survey development period (from April 2017-September 2017), a small sample test (n = 150) was conducted to verify the reliability and validity of the questionnaire on death education needs of adult cancer patients. This questionnaire was developed based on a literature review and discussion among the study group. Next, 324 adults with cancer, recruited from a three-level cancer hospital in Tianjin, China, were surveyed to analyse their needs for death education, using the questionnaire that had been tested in the pretest period. Finally, a Delphi survey was conducted from October 2017-January 2018. A panel of experts (n = 23) recruited from major hospitals, nursing schools and universities in China in the fields of clinical nursing, nursing management, clinical medicine and psychological care took part in the study to revise the training contents based on the investigation results. The reliability and validity of results based on the small sample test revealed that the Cronbach's alpha coefficient and the half-degree of reliability of the questionnaire were 0.924 and 0.951, respectively. This demonstrated that the questionnaire had high reliability. The KMO was 0.756 and the Bartlett Test of Sphericity showed p < 0.001, indicating that the factor analysis was justified in the sample. Eight components with eigenvalues greater than one were retained by the factor analysis. The investigation of the patients' needs for death education showed that the overall score of patients' needs was 3.60 +/- 0.709 points (needs were measured on a scale from 1-5, where 5 indicates high needs), and there were high demands for education regarding cancer patient life reviews, death-related ethical issues and to leave peacefully. Data from expert panel members were collected in two rounds over a 4-month period, and consensus was achieved in the second Delphi round. The final death education contents of adult cancer patients contained four sections: cancer, death, psychology and practice. These were divided into 54 teaching topics to be included in 14 courses. Conclusions Relevance to clinical practice The adult cancer patient death education training content devised in this study is science-based, practical and can be used as a guide for clinical nurses to provide high-quality care to adult cancer patients. Nurses could become more involved in providing death education to adult cancer patients and their families. Further research is needed to explore the applicability of the training content and to develop the content according to changing times and patients' needs.;"[Zhao, Song Xian; Qiang, Wan Min] Tianjin Med Univ Canc Inst & Hosp, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiao Na] Tianjin Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Luo, Zhi Qin] Tianjin Med Univ Canc Inst & Hosp, Dept Integrated Tradit Chinese & Western Med, Tianjin, Peoples R China";Qiang, WM (corresponding author), Tianjin Med Univ Canc Inst & Hosp, Tianjin, Peoples R China.;nursing1331@sina.com;;"songxian, zhao/0000-0003-0819-4615; Qiang, Wanmin/0000-0002-9044-7476";;;;26;3;3;2;27;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0962-1067;1365-2702;;J CLIN NURS;J.

To assist decision-makers, an expert system, encompasses interactive computer-based systems or subsystems to support the decision-making process. Typically, most expert systems are built on top of transaction systems, databases, and data models and restricted in decision-making to the analysis, processing and presenting data and information, and they do not provide support for the normative layer. This paper will provide a solution to one specific problem that arises from this situation, namely the lack of tool/mechanism to demonstrate how an expert system is well-suited for supporting decision-making activities drawn from existing records and relevant legal requirements aligned existing records stored in various databases.We present a Rule-based (pre and post) reporting systems (RuleRS) architecture, which is intended to integrate databases, in particular, relational databases, with a logic-based reasoner and rule engine to assist in decision-making or create reports according to legal norms. We argue that the resulting RuleRS provides an efficient and flexible solution to the problem at hand using defeasible inference.

Fuzzy inference systems (FIS) were previously employed for either the computerized iterative exergoeconomic optimization or fast optimization of the energy system. The shortcoming of the FIS system was that the requirement to have numerous fuzzy rules and fuzzy membership function that must be collected based on experts' knowledge and usually with try and error steps. On the other hand, conventional optimization methods such as genetic algorithm consume significant calculation time that makes them unsuitable for the fast optimization. In this paper, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system known as the ANFIS was introduced for fast exergoeconomic optimization of energy systems. The ANFIS system automatically developed the required fuzzy items and used them for fast optimization of energy systems. It was employed on two case studies, one for exergoeconomic design and optimization of a benchmark energy system known as the CGAM problem. It was shown that the ANFIS could achieve the optimal solutions of systems with reasonable accuracy, very low computation time, and without dependency on experts' knowledge to develop fuzzy data. The ANFIS was found as an optimistic alternative for the fast optimization of energy systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

To inform CHW policy, the Government of Tanzania launched a program in 2011 to determine if community case management (CCM) of malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea could be implemented by CHW in that country. Methods: This paper reports the results of an observational study on the CCM service delivery quality of a trial cohort of CHW in Tanzania, called WAJA. In 2014, teams of data collectors, employees of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare trained in IMCI, assessed the IMCI skills rendered by a sample of WAJA on sick children who presented to WAJA with illness signs and symptoms in their communities. The assessment included direct observations of WAJA IMCI episodes and expert re-assessment of the same children seen by WAJA to assess the congruence between the assessment, classification and treatment outcomes of WAJA cases and those from cases conducted by expert re-assessors. Results: In the majority of cases, WAJA correctly assess sick children for CCM-treatable illnesses (malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea) and general danger signs (90% and 89%, respectively), but too few correctly assess for physical danger signs (39%); on classification in the majority of cases (73%) WAJA correctly classified illness, though more for CCM-treatable illnesses (83%). In majority of cases (78%) WAJA treated children correctly (84% of malaria, 74% pneumonia, and 71% diarrhea cases). Errors were often associated with lapses in health systems support, mainly supervision and logistics. Conclusion: CCM is a feasible strategy for CHW in Tanzania, who, in the majority of cases, implemented the approach as well as IMCI expert re-assessors. Nevertheless, for CCM to be effective, in Tanzania, a strategy to implement it must be coordinated with efforts to strengthen local health systems.";"[Baynes, Colin; Ramsey, Kate] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Mboya, Dominic; Likasi, Samuel; Maganga, Doroth; Baraka, Jitihada] Ifakara Hlth Inst, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Pemba, Senga] Tanzania Training Ctr Int Hlth, Ifakara, Tanzania; [Semu, Helen] Minist Hlth & Social Welf, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania";Baynes, C (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10027 USA.;colin.baynes@gmail.com;;;"Doris Duke Charitable FoundationDoris Duke Charitable Foundation (DDCF) [DDCF2009058a]; Comic Relief UK [112259]";This work was supported by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation [grant number DDCF2009058a] and Comic Relief UK [grant number 112259].;;36;4;4;0;1;KERMAN UNIV MEDICAL SCIENCES;KERMAN;JAHAD BLVD, KERMAN, 7619813159, IRAN;2322-5939;;;INT J HEALTH POLICY;Int.

There is a growing recognition that many changes are needed at the macro, meso and micro management levels to tackle these challenges. Therefore, knowing if healthcare organizations are ready for change is a key issue, as high organizational readiness for change (ORC) has been positively related with higher organizational effort and staff motivation for overcoming barriers and setbacks in change endeavours. In practice, readiness for change is not commonly measured and there is a need of adequate metrics for it. In this commentary, a new tool for measuring readiness change is reviewed, the OR4KT. It has been developed based on a solid theoretical background and with the involvement of experts and potential users in the design and it has been tested and validated in three languages and in different organizational settings. Although its generalizability needs to be further tested, it seems to be a promising and useful tool to diagnose if organizations are ready to implement evidence-informed changes. A broader recognition of the key role that the science of implementation can play in the success of much needed transformations in healthcare provides a good opportunity for the dissemination of the OR4KT.;[Nuno-Solinis, Roberto] Deusto Business Sch, Bilbao, Spain;Nuno-Solinis, R (corresponding author), Deusto Business Sch, Bilbao, Spain.;roberto.nuno@deusto.es;Nuno-Solinis, Roberto/J-5443-2016;Nuno-Solinis, Roberto/0000-0001-9930-4589;;;;23;4;4;2;4;KERMAN UNIV MEDICAL SCIENCES;KERMAN;JAHAD BLVD, KERMAN, 7619813159, IRAN;2322-5939;;;INT J HEALTH POLICY;Int.

Moreover, in the Geosciences the GPS positioning is relevant to the data acquisition as well as to the planning of the fieldwork. Nowadays, mobile devices are widespread, constituting an accessible platform consisting of single devices coupled with different sensors for data acquisition, such as GPS, compass, magnetometer, etc. Emerging technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR) enable the use of these devices as a software platform to complement the perception of our surrounding environment. Despite the fact that there are several AR applications focused on different aspects of Geosciences, a comprehensive fieldwork oriented system, which can be easily adapted to the community needs, is still missing. Based on a multidisciplinary work between professionals from Geosciences and Computer Sciences, we designed and developed a framework based AR system named ARGeo. The proposed system constitutes a complementing tool for the geologist's fieldwork carefully designed to be used in remote sites, using only the mobile device hardware and without the need of an interne connection for data acquisition. ARGeo complements the fieldwork observation and the precise recording of geological data needed, e.g., for the interpretation of folded structures. It allows the user to register geo-tagged information such as points of interests (i.e. references on the field or the fold itself) using natural interactions. In addition, it provides two novel features: an interactive dipping plane measurement from distant points of view and a back-in-time visualization of previous recorded positions, in order to help understanding the spatial relations among the recorded samples. Pilot studies were conducted with domain experts of geology and they agree on the potential of the system. Results point out that ARGeo naturally integrates mobile devices and AR to the geologists' fieldwork.

However, studies have generally investigated videos showing only single viewpoints, for example, face-to-face or over-the-shoulder. Single views may not be appropriate for learning complex medical procedures involving spatial viewpoint changes. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of mixed camera viewpoints on learning a complex medical hand procedure from a video. Using a pretest-posttest paradigm, 43 students at a French nursing school had to learn a complex hand procedure from a video showing an expert nurse teacher inserting an indwelling catheter in a closed system using a simulation mannequin. Three video conditions were compared, delivering the same information in the same amount of time, from different viewpoints: (i) face-to-face only (FtF), (ii) over-the shoulder only (OtS), and (iii) alternating face-to-face and over-the-shoulder views for each step of the procedure (MixW). The students were randomly assigned (N = 10-11) to one of four groups: the three experimental viewing conditions (FtF, OtS, MixW) and a control condition without video. Pre- and posttests consisted of performing the hand procedure in a fully equipped full-scale simulation room. Results showed that learners in the mixed viewpoint (MixW) group performed better than the other groups (FtF, OtS, and control condition). Learners in the FtF and OtS groups outperformed those in the control group. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We introduce semantic flow graph (SFG), a novel graph representation and interaction framework that enables users to explore the relationships among key objects (i.e., field lines, features, and spatiotemporal regions) of both steady and unsteady flow fields. The objects and their relationships are organized as a heterogeneous graph. We assign each object a set of attributes, based on which a semantic abstraction of the heterogeneous graph is generated. This semantic abstraction is SFG. We design a suite of operations to explore the underlying flow fields based on this graph representation and abstraction mechanism. Users can flexibly reconfigure SFG to examine the relationships among groups of objects at different abstraction levels. Three linked views are developed to display SFG, its node split criteria and history, and the objects in the spatial volume. For simplicity, we introduce SFG construction and exploration for steady flow fields with critical points being the only features. Then we demonstrate that SFG can be naturally extended to deal with unsteady flow fields and multiple types of features. We experiment with multiple data sets and conduct an expert evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.;"[Tao, Jun; Wang, Chaoli; Chawla, Nitesh V.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Shi, Lei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Software, State Key Lab Comp Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Shi, Lei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Kim, Seung Hyun] Ohio State Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA";Tao, J (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.;"jtao1@nd.edu; chaoli.wang@nd.edu; nchawla@nd.edu; shil@ios.ac.cn; kim.5061@osu.edu";"Wang, Chaoli/AAJ-5173-2020; Kim, Seung Hyun/N-7343-2016";"Wang, Chaoli/0000-0002-0859-3619; ";"US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IIS-1456763, IIS-1455886]; Notre Dame Global Collaboration Initiative Program; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61379088, 61772504]; China National 973 projectNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB340301]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & EnginrNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) [1455886] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Information & Intelligent SystemsNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) [1455886] Funding Source: National Science Foundation";This research was supported in part by the US National Science Foundation through grants IIS-1456763 and IIS-1455886, the Notre Dame Global Collaboration Initiative Program, China National 973 project 2014CB340301, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China through grants No. 61379088 and No. 61772504.

J;Wybo, JL;;;;Wybo, Jean-Luc;;;Track circuit reliability assessment for preventing railway accidents;SAFETY SCIENCE;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"CONTACT; ADHESION; DIAGNOSIS";The safe operation of a railway signaling system depends on accurate and up-to-date information on the position and movements of trains provided by train detection devices. Track circuits are the most popular systems used over the world to provide information on position and movements of trains and ensure safety of circulations. Track circuits' failure or malfunction have two consequences: operating unreliability causing train delays, and accidents. In this paper, we focus on potential accidents. In close cooperation with experts and practitioners of the French national railways company SNCF, we have designed a reliability model of track circuits taking into account local conditions: environment, vehicles, track, traffic, track circuit technology and use. Combined with an assessment of potential accidents' severity due to TC failure, this model aims at supporting managers' strategies to reduce the risks and optimize resources allocation. This model is also used to predict potential locations of track circuits that may generate malfunctions, using a measure of similarity with track circuits' locations where malfunctions occurred. Using the database of past malfunctions, the similarity measure uses the model's parameters to set up and update a classification of malfunction types. Each type is compared with the database of track circuits to identify those that are similar enough to raise attention and check if appropriate prevention measures are already in place or need to be added. The model is used as a support tool by the local staff to optimize the resources needed to ensure safety by setting priorities among track circuits and determining which ones need prevention and/or protection measures. The model was designed and implemented in a French region where track circuits malfunctions have a higher probability to occur due to climatic conditions in autumn that pollute the wheel-rail contact.;[Wybo, Jean-Luc] European Univ Cyprus, 768 Chemin Verriere, F-06560 Valbonne, France;Wybo, JL (corresponding author), European Univ Cyprus, 768 Chemin Verriere, F-06560 Valbonne, France.;j.wybo@external.euc.ac.cy;;;SNCF;The development of this method was funded by SNCF with the support of SNCF experts: Luc MARTELOT and Roland KIEFFER.

It requires using a structured argumentation, named Safety Case, to present the fulfilment of these conditions. As guidance for building the Safety Case, this standard provides the structure of high-level safety objectives and the recommendations of development techniques according to different Safety Integrity Levels (SIL). Nevertheless, the rationale connecting these techniques to the high-level safety objectives is not explicit. The proposed techniques stem from experts belief in the effectiveness and efficiency of these techniques to achieve the underlying safety objectives. So, how should one formalize and assess this belief? And as a result how much confidence can we have in the safety of railway systems when these standards are used? To deal with these questions, the paper successively addresses two aspects: (1) making explicit the safety assurance rationale by modelling the Safety Case with GSN (Goal Structuring Notation) according to EN5012x standards; (2) proposing a quantitative framework based on Dempster-Shafer theory to formalize and assessing the confidence in the Safety Case.

PIM-Check is a screening tool designed to detect PIM in internal medicine patients. ObjectiveMethodThis study aimed to determine whether PIM-Check could help to identify and reduce DRPs. Prospective interventional study conducted on patients admitted to internal medicine wards in a university hospital between 1 September 2015 and 30 October 2015. Adult patients were included if they were hospitalized for more than 48hours. Patients received either usual care (period 1=control) or usual care plus medication screening by the wards' chief residents using PIM-Check (period 2=intervention). An expert panel, composed of a clinical pharmacist, a clinical pharmacologist and two attending physicians in internal medicine, blinded to patient groups, identified DRPs. ResultsWhat is new and conclusionA total of 297 patients were included (intervention: 109). The groups' demographic parameters were similar. The expert panel identified 909 DRPs (598: control; 311: intervention). The mean number of DRPs per patient was similar in the control (3.2; 95% CI: 2.9-3.5) and intervention groups (2.9; 95% CI: 2.4-3.3) (P=.12). PIM-Check displayed 33.4% of the 311 DRPs identified in the intervention group. In this study, PIM-Check had limited value, as the average number of DRPs per person was similar in both groups. Although one-third of DRPs counted in intervention group had been identified by PIM-Check, this did not lead to a reduction in DRPs. This lack of impact of PIM-Check on drug prescription may be explained by the number of alerts displayed by the application and hospital physicians' reluctance to modify the treatments for chronic conditions previously prescribed by general practitioners.";"[Blanc, A. -L.; Guignard, B.; Desnoyer, A.; Bonnabry, P.] Geneva Univ Hosp, Pharm, Geneva, Switzerland; [Blanc, A. -L.; Bonnabry, P.] Univ Lausanne, Univ Geneva, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Guignard, B.; Samer, C.] Geneva Univ Hosp, Clin Pharmacol & Toxicol Dept, Geneva, Switzerland; [Desnoyer, A.] Univ Paris Saclay, Fac Pharm, Chatenay Malabry, France; [Grosgurin, O.; Marti, C.] Geneva Univ Hosp, Internal Med & Rehabil Dept, Geneva, Switzerland";Blanc, AL (corresponding author), Pharm Hop Est Leman, Vevey, Switzerland.;Annelaure.blanc@phel.ch;"Anne-Laure, Blanc/Y-1701-2019; Desnoyer, Aude/E-5172-2013";Desnoyer, Aude/0000-0003-3534-2206;"Swiss Association of Public Health Administration and Hospital Pharmacists (GSASA) annual national grant, 2013; Research and Development Project (PRD), Medical Direction and Quality, University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland, 2015";This work was supported by: (i) Swiss Association of Public Health Administration and Hospital Pharmacists (GSASA) annual national grant, 2013.

Although widely used, their impact on laboratory performance has not been investigated. Methods: We retrospectively analysed the results of 167 laboratories in 59 distributions of the Austrian red cell immunohaematology external quality assessment (EQA) scheme in the years 1999-2017. The performance for each parameter and trends of individual participants were compared with respect to certification or accreditation status of participants' quality systems and to laboratory type. Results: Considering more than 52,000 EQA results, the absence or presence of a laboratory quality management system showed different error rates. Laboratories with ISO 9001 or ISO 15189 certification/accreditation had 0.7% incorrect results, while this rate was doubled without such quality systems (1.4%, p=0.0002). Statistically significant error reductions were seen upon ISO 9001/ISO 15189 implementation (1.3% before vs. 0.7% after; p=0.0468). Transfusion services had fewer errors (0.9%) compared to hospital and independent laboratories (both 1.2%). Conclusions: Implementation and maintenance of quality systems according to ISO 9001 or ISO 15189 as well as laboratory specialisation result in better analytical performance as can be seen in immunohaematology EQA results. The conclusion is that these results apply to other laboratory tests and perhaps to other areas of health care.";"[Buchta, Christoph; Mayr, Wolfgang R.; Mueller, Mathias M.; Oeser, Reinhard; Koermoeczi, Guenther F.] Austrian Assoc Qual Assurance & Standardizat Med, OQUASTA, Horlgasse 18-5, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Coucke, Wim] Sci Inst Publ Hlth, Qual Med Labs, Brussels, Belgium; [Mayr, Wolfgang R.; Koermoeczi, Guenther F.] Med Univ Vienna, Dept Blood Grp Serol & Transfus Med, Vienna, Austria; [Oeser, Reinhard] Oeser GmbH, Vienna, Austria; [Schweiger, Christian R.] Med Univ Vienna, Clin Inst Lab Med, Vienna, Austria";Buchta, C (corresponding author), Austrian Assoc Qual Assurance & Standardizat Med, OQUASTA, Horlgasse 18-5, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.;christoph.buchta@oequasta.at;"Buchta, Christoph/AAD-6982-2021; Coucke, Wim/ABA-9949-2020";"Coucke, Wim/0000-0002-4290-4628; Buchta, Christoph/0000-0002-4153-8195";;;;21;2;2;0;9;WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH;BERLIN;GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY;1434-6621;1437-4331;;CLIN CHEM LAB MED;Clin.

First, mass public opinion is believed to derive from elite messages. In the 2016 presidential campaign, candidate Donald Trump maintained that the election system was rigged, while election administration experts and officials received considerable media coverage in their efforts to counter Trump's claims. Second, literature on voter confidence has established a winner effect-voters who cast ballots for winners are more likely than voters on the losing side to believe their vote was counted correctly. Thus, voters were exposed to two theoretically opposite effects. In this paper, we find that the winner effect mitigates the effects from strong pre-election cues from elites. We also show the effect of pre-election attention to the rigging issue, find a symmetry of the election outcome effect for winners and losers, and reconsider our explanations of the winner effect. Finally, we go beyond the existing studies of the winner effect to consider the kind of citizens who are most susceptible to that effect.;"[Sinclair, Betsy; Smith, Steven S.] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO USA; [Tucker, Patrick D.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT USA";Tucker, PD (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Inst Social & Policy Studies, 77 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.;patrick.tucker@yale.edu;;;;;;51;3;3;0;15;SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC;THOUSAND OAKS;2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA;1065-9129;1938-274X;;POLIT RES QUART;Polit.

Systems engineering uses analytical methods to reduce uncertainty, but a growing body of work from other disciplines indicates that cognitive heuristics also affect decision-making. Results from interviews with expert aerospace practitioners suggest that engineers bias estimation strategies. Practitioners reaffirmed known system features and posited that engineers may bias estimation methods as a negotiation and resource conservation strategy. Specifically, participants reported that some systems engineers game the system by biasing requirements to counteract subsystem estimation biases. An agent-based model (ABM) simulation which recreates these characteristics is presented. Model results suggest that system-level estimate accuracy and uncertainty depend on subsystem behavior and are not significantly affected by systems engineers' gaming strategy.;"[Meluso, John] Univ Michigan, Design Sci Program, Global Design Lab, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Austin-Breneman, Jesse] Univ Michigan, Dept Mech Engn, Global Design Lab, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA";Meluso, J (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Design Sci Program, Global Design Lab, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;"jmeluso@umich.edu; jausbren@umich.edu";;;;;;52;4;4;1;10;ASME;NEW YORK;TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA;1050-0472;;;J MECH DESIGN;J.

However, wind energy faces a number of challenges, one of them being risks to public safety from wind turbine failures. This paper provides an analysis as a first step towards integrating wind turbine failures with public safety risks. In this paper, an existing Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) of wind turbines is expanded to include wind turbine failures that could be linked to public safety risks. The paper combines knowledge from literature related to wind turbine failures with expert judgements. Quantification of component failures and failure modes in the expanded FTA is carried out, and wind turbine failure modes related to the assessment of risks to public safety from wind turbines are analysed. The failures modes used in the Dutch system for assessing public safety risks from wind turbines are compared with the outcomes of this study and improvements to this assessment procedure are proposed.

Model assumptions are first proposed by experts and then formalized using graph theory and stochastic models. The prognosis approach relies on a diagnostic algorithm that combines diagnostic information from different sources (e.g., measurements and inspections) to detect active failure mechanisms and track their progression, and a prognostic algorithm that predicts failure mode occurrences dynamically as new information becomes available. Furthermore, the approach identifies undetectable failure mechanisms where no symptoms have yet been measured. The relative simplicity of the algorithms and graphical representation of the results helps to build decision-makers' trust. In addition, the approach is a means of capturing acquired knowledge and available data. A case study of a hydroelectric generator stator is proposed. The resulting multi-state degradation model identified more than 150 failure mechanisms discretized in 70 physical states and leading to three failure modes. Three historical failure and one online case studies are presented, based on diagnostic data from Hydro-Quebec's generating fleet. In two of the case studies, the failure mode occurrence could have been predicted more than eight years in advance.;"[Blancke, Olivier; Tahan, Antoine] Ecole Technol Super, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Komljenovic, Dragan; Amyot, Normand; Levesque, Melanie; Hudon, Claude] Inst Rech Hydro Quebec IREQ, Varennes, PQ J3X 1S1, Canada";Blancke, O (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.;olivier.blancke.1@ens.etsmtl.ca;Blancke, Olivier/AAF-6569-2019;"Tahan, Souheil Antoine/0000-0002-9228-5255; Komljenovic, Dragan/0000-0002-1542-4426";"Pronostic des equipements majeurs project at IREQ; Hydro Quebec research institute in Varennes, Quebec; MITACS scholarship program";The work described in this paper was fully supported by the Pronostic des equipements majeurs project at IREQ, the Hydro Quebec research institute in Varennes, Quebec, and by the MITACS scholarship program.;;36;5;6;0;8;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;0951-8320;1879-0836;;RELIAB ENG SYST SAFE;Reliab.

This necessitates the need for proper planning during this period. In this regard, the present study was conducted with the aim of fitting the indicators for choosing optimal sports location for the elderly. Methods & Materials The present study is a descriptive-analytic research that determined the weights of research criteria using a structured interview with eight experts in Analytical Hierarchy Process. In addition, the pools of Karaj (27 cases) were selected as the study population and the elderly people referred to these pools were selected as the research community. A total of 127 elderly were examined using stratified sampling. After weighing the sub-criteria of each research criterion, AutoCAD, Excel, ArcGIS, and Google Earth software were used to create a spatial database. Results Of the total 127 elder participants, 66% were male, 48% were aged 60-65 years, and 54% spent more than 6 hours a week on sports. According to experts' opinions, three indicators of accessibility, proximity to other land uses, and safety ranked higher in the field of influencing the selection of sports places. Among the sub-criteria, subway lines and highways for access index; proximity to parks and green spaces and proximity to cultural centers for proximity index; and proper position to health centers and fire centers for safety index had relative importance compared to other sub-criteria. Conclusion Proximity to other land uses and safety was recognized as important criteria influencing the selection of sports places.

However, there are no validated instruments for Latin America. Objective: To validate an instrument to assess new fathers' experiences during childbirth in Latin America. Design: Prospective validation study. Setting: Talcahuano, Chile. Population: Fathers who participated in the birth of their first child (n=220) between September 2015 to May 2016, in a public hospital in Chile. Methods: The Swedish questionnaire First Time Fathers Questionnaire was used. As a first step, the questionnaire was translated to Spanish, followed by expert judgment of such translation and validation. For content validity, a descriptive analysis of the expert judgment and combined Kappa evaluation was performed. Construct validity with Exploratory Factor Analysis was done. Reliability based on internal consistency, was tested using Cronbach's Alpha. Criteria validity was tested with Pearson correlation and Student t-test, and logistic regression. Main outcome measures: Questionnaire in Spanish with adequate evidence of reliability and validity. Results: Two components were identified: Support from the Health System and Father Worry, with 19 items and adequate internal reliability (0.84 and 0.79 respectively). There is a statistically significant inverse correlation between Father Worry and Support from the Health System. There is a statistically significant association between Father Worry and the type of delivery, being higher in Caesarean sections. There is a statistically significant association between Support of the Health System and preparation for childbirth being higher in those who were prepared. Conclusions: This study provides a validated instrument to assess the experience of fathers who participate in the birth of their first child in Latin America. Implications for practice: The evaluation of the paternal experience during birth contributes to the knowledge of the male's emotional processes involved in this event. Midwifery is in a key position to promote a transcendent parental experience. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, this semiquantitative study is proposing and demonstrating an upgraded bowtie analysis for safety effect assessments that can be performed without the need for expert acquisition. While bowtie analysis is commonly used in, for example, process engineering, it is novel in road traffic safety. Four crash case studies are completed using bowtie analysis, letting the input parameters sequentially vary over the entire range of possible expert opinions. The results suggest that only proactive safety measures estimated to decrease the probability of specific crash risk factors to at least very improbable can perceptibly decrease crash probability. Further, the success probability of a reactive measure must be at least moderately probable to reduce the probability of a serious or fatal crash by half or more. This upgraded bowtie approach allows the identification of (1) the sensitivity of the probability of a crash and its consequences to expert judgment used in the bowtie model and (2) the necessary effectiveness of a chosen safety measure allowing adequate changes in the probability of a crash and its consequences.

Similarities among these frameworks include the utilization of performance indicators for quality appraisal. However, there are discrepancies in the ways such frameworks are researched, developed, and applied. Additionally, there are problematic aspects even in their common characteristics, like the relative absence of correlation between observed performance indicator values and benchmarked ones, and the deliverables' disparity due to the diversity of the quantified indicator variables. For the alleviation of such problematic aspects, this paper presents a bridge quality appraisal methodological and computational framework. It builds on (1) the adaptation of the sustainable building methodology and its combination with expert input solicitation methods and the research findings of the European Cooperation in Science & Technology (COST) Action TU1406, and (2) a multi-input adaptation of the analytical hierarchy process. The methodology is presented in terms of its general procedural steps and calculating requirements, and then it is tailored to reinforced concrete overpass roadway bridges.

In this paper, we introduce a quality controlled PPG compression technique using principal component analysis to keep the local and global distortion of the reconstructed data within pre-specified limits. To achieve this, optimum number of eigenvectors (EV) and principal components (PC) along with their quantization level (Q) were selected for compression. The technique was validated with pre-recorded 2 min and 10 min PPG data collected from 35 healthy volunteers (N) and 35 cardiovascular patients (CVP) under fully resting condition. At limiting PRD of 5% and absolute error of 8%, for N group (CVP group) an average compression ratio (CR), PRD and MAE of 5.65 (6.76), 2.41% (3.33%) and 6.1% (7.3%) were obtained respectively. Relaxing the control criteria up to clinically acceptable limits, a CR of 13.28 for N and 13.31 for CVP group were achieved. Most of the clinical features had an average deviation of less that 6% from their original values. The method yielded lower CR, PRDN and MAE with noisy (motion artifact and Gaussian noise) PPG. With two different stress levels, the compression parameters were found to vary. The reconstruction results were clinically validated by experts. A successful real-time data streaming in computer proved the usefulness of the technique for continuous monitoring applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, vehicle testing is also costly, time consuming and it is vital that these are conducted efficiently and that the information they yield is maximised. Vehicles are complex systems, but it is straightforward to install intensive instrumentation to record many data channels. Due to costs, relatively few repeated test cycles are conducted. Identifying correlations within these datasets is challenging and requires expert input who ultimately focus on small subsets of the original data. In this paper, a novel application of Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression is used to explore the complete data set, without the need for data exclusion. Two approaches are used, the first collapses the data set and analyses all data channels without time variations, while the second unfolds the data set to avoid any information loss. The technique allows for the systematic analysis of large datasets in a very time efficient way meaning more information can be obtained about a testing campaign. The methodology is used successfully to identify sources of imprecision in four different case studies to analyse sources of imprecision in vehicle testing on a chassis dynamometer. These findings will lead to significant improvements in vehicle testing, allowing both substantial savings in testing effort and increased likelihood confidence in demonstrating the cog-benefit of new products. The measurement analysis technique can also be applied to other fields where repeated testing or batch processes are conducted.;"[Burke, R. D.; Chappell, E.

Agricultural land is monitored using the Land Parcel Identification System and visual image interpretation. However, shadows covering reference parcel boundaries can hinder effective delineation. Visual interpretation of shadows is labor intensive and subjective, while automated methods give reproducible results. In this paper we compare shadow detection on satellite imagery obtained by expert photointerpretation to a proposed automated, data-driven method. The latter automated method is a thresholding approach employing both panchromatic and multispectral imagery, where the former has a finer spatial resolution than the latter. Thresholds are determined from automatically generated training data using a risk-based approach. Comparison of the total shadow area per scene showed that more pixels were labelled as shadow by the automatic procedure than by visual interpretation. However, the union of shadow area independently identified by twelve experts on a subscene was larger than the automatically determined shadow area. The limited intersection of the shadow areas identified by the experts demonstrated that experts strongly disagreed in their interpretations. The shadow area labelled by the automated method was in between the intersection and the union of the areas interpreted by experts. Furthermore, the automated shadow detection method is reproducible and reduces the interpretation effort and skill required.;"[Tarko, Agnieszka; de Bruin, Sytze; Bregt, Arnold K.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands";Tarko, A (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.;"agnieszka.tarko@wur.nl; sytze.debruin@wur.nl; arnold.bregt@wur.nl";de Bruin, Sytze/N-1183-2014;Tarko, Agnieszka/0000-0001-6295-5927;;;;32;3;3;3;17;ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV;AMSTERDAM;PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS;0303-2434;;;INT J APPL EARTH OBS;Int.

In more details, we have implemented and deployed an influence analysis algorithm on the Microsoft Azure public cloud platform to investigate the impact of a number of factors on the performance obtained by cloud users. These factors comprise the type of the implemented architecture, the volume of the data to analyze, the size of the cluster of nodes realizing the architectures and their characteristics, the deployment costs, as well as the quality of the output when the analysis is subjected to strict temporal deadlines. Experimental campaigns have been carried out on the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100 Million (YFCC100M). Reported results and discussions show that Lambda outperforms Kappa architecture for the class of problems investigated. Providing a variety of analyses - e.g., also investigating the impact of dataset size, scaling, cost - this paper provides useful insights on the performance of these state-of-art big data architectures that are helpful to both experts and newcomers interested in deploying big data architectures leveraging cloud platforms.

In this paper we set out to revisit SGD with practical concerns in mind and hope to provide intuition on how SGD should be done in the right way in applications for expert and intelligence systems. In literature, when implementing SGD, regularization is often added to the loss function, to avoid ill-conditioning or overfitting, or to obtain solutions with desirable sparse structure. Intuitively, regularized loss function deviates from the true loss and in this case SGD may lead to a suboptimal solution. In this paper we revisit the matter of l(2) regularization for SGD, to investigate whether or when an explicit regularizer is necessary to obtain the desirable performance. We further introduce a simple stochastic algorithm (ASG) using the accumulated stochastic gradient of the un-regularized loss. Then experiments are carried out on benchmark data sets to validate the theoretical analysis. The findings show that for l(2 )regularization, (1) SGD without explicit regularizing (SGDE) actually possesses an implicit regularizer, and in the sense of upper bound of the convergence rate, it outperforms SGD regularized explicitly (SGDER) with a constant advantage; (2) ASG without explicit regularizing outperforms both SGDE and SGDER, especially in the case where the number of iteration T cannot be pre-specified; (3) for SGD algorithms, the schemes that places flexible weight on the output of the latest iteration can give a better trade-off, compared with the scheme using the output of the last iteration or taking the average of the output of each iteration, and this suggests that in application a tunable averaging scheme is preferable. This study provides insights on using SGD algorithms for big data applications, e.g., to accelerate SVMs or regularized regression in large-scale, or to improve the performance of online learning or real time forecasting (control). In particular, when T is pre-specified, SGDE (without an explicit regularizer) can give us a well enough perforce with simplicity and understandability; when T cannot be pre-specified, ASG can improve the performance of standard SGD algorithms.

This paper proposes an Integer Programming (IP) formulation for the staff scheduling problem encountered in practice at an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system. Two types of heuristics (a diving heuristic and a VNDS heuristic) are implemented and extensively tested on a set of problem instances with different dimensions. Results show that the VNDS heuristic clearly outperforms both the diving heuristic and a state-of-the-art commercial IP solver. It is able to find good quality solutions for realistic problem instances in relatively short computation times. The characteristics that determine the relative difficulty of a problem instance are also investigated. Furthermore, the model is applied to a case study at the Portuguese National Institute for Medical Emergencies. For this purpose, the VNDS heuristic has been implemented in an expert system with an easy-to-use graphical user interface. A number of different schedules proposed by the system are compared with the schedule implemented in practice. This analysis shows that the VNDS heuristic is a significant improvement over the current manual scheduling procedure. Moreover, two what-if scenarios are described to show how the expert system can be used to assist managers in making decisions on contracting additional staff or providing training to workers.

However, in programming courses with high student-teacher ratios, it is practically impossible to provide feedback to all homeworks submitted by students. In this paper, we propose a data-driven tool for semi-automatic identification of typical approaches and errors in student solutions. Having a list of frequent errors, a teacher can prepare common feedback to all students that explains the difficult concepts. We present the problem as supervised rule learning, where each rule corresponds to a specific approach or error. We use correct and incorrect submitted programs as the learning examples, where patterns in abstract syntax trees are used as attributes. As the space of all possible patterns is immense, we needed the help of experts to select relevant patterns. To elicit knowledge from the experts, we used the argument-based machine learning (ABML) method, in which an expert and ABML interactively exchange arguments until the model is good enough. We provide a step-by-step demonstration of the ABML process, present examples of ABML questions and corresponding expert's answers, and interpret some of the induced rules. The evaluation on 42 Prolog exercises further shows the usefulness of the knowledge elicitation process, as the models constructed using ABML achieve significantly better accuracy than the models learned from human-defined patterns or from automatically extracted patterns.

However, existing methods cannot handle mediation-aided Web service composition involving complex mediation transitions, suffer from low efficiency owing to the larger size of time automata (TA) models, or are unable to automatically check temporal constraints whose activities do not include exchanged messages by observing TA. In this paper, we present a novel three-stage approach for analyzing timed compatibility of mediation-aided Web service composition via model checking. First, stage 1 treats each service in Petri net based mediation-aided Web service composition as a fragment. Second, stage 2 transforms fragments into a time automata net (TAN) based on structure transformation and interactive message transformation. Finally, stage 3 checks all types of temporal constraints. The main impact of our approach on expert and intelligent systems involves the following aspects: 1) mediation-aided service composition with complex mediation transitions can be dealt with; 2) compact TAN can be constructed for fragments in which the number of states and arcs is dramatically decreased and the verification time is extremely reduced compared with existing methods; and 3) temporal constraints whose activities have or do not have exchanged messages can be located in TAN. The main significance of our approach in the field of expert and intelligent systems is that it can greatly reduce the risk of making business decisions and the cost of handling temporal violations, and improves the innovation capability of enterprises.

However, classical rough set-based methods consider only categorical data; furthermore, neighborhood rough sets adhere to numeric and heterogeneous data, but their outlier detection is mainly restricted to numeric data now. According to the hybrid data-driving, this paper investigates outlier detection by the neighborhood information entropy and its developmental measures, and the applicable data sets widely concern categorical, numeric, and mixed data; as a result, the new method extends both the traditional distance-based and rough set-based methods to enrich outlier detection. Concretely, the neighborhood information system is first determined by the heterogeneous distance and self-adapting radius, the neighborhood information entropy is then defined to implement whole uncertainty measurement, three gradual information measures are further constructed to describe each single object, and finally the neighborhood entropy-based outlier factor (NEOF) is integratedly established to detect outliers; moreover, the NEOF-based outlier detection algorithm (called the NIEOD algorithm) is designed and applied. By virtue of UCI data experiments, the NIEOD algorithm is compared with six existing detection algorithms (including the NED, IE, SEQ FindCBLOF, DIS, KNN algorithms), and the concrete results generally reflect the better effectiveness and adaptability of the new method.

We apply C-MCRDR knowledge-base systems (KBS) to the Textual Question Answering (TQA) and Natural Language Interface to Databases (NLIDB) paradigms in restricted domains as a type of spoken dialog system (SDS) or conversational agent (CA). C-MCRDR implicitly maintains topical conversational context, and intra-dialog context is retained allowing explicit referencing in KB rule conditions and classifications. To facilitate NLIDB, post-inference C-MCRDR classifications can include generic query referencing - query specificity is achieved by the binding of pre-identified context. In contrast to other scripted, or syntactically complex systems, the KB of the live system can easily be maintained courtesy of the RDR knowledge engineering approach. For evaluation, we applied this system to a pedagogical domain that uses a production database for the generation of offline course-related documents. Our system complemented the domain by providing a spoken or textual question-answering alternative for undergraduates based on the same production database. The developed system incorporates a speech-enabled chatbot interface via Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and experimental results from a live, integrated feedback rating system showed significant user acceptance, indicating the approach is promising, feasible and further work is warranted. Evaluation of the prototype's viability found the system responded appropriately for 80.3% of participant requests in the tested domain, and it responded inappropriately for 19.7% of requests due to incorrect dialog classifications (4.4%) or out of scope requests (15.3%). Although the semantic range of the evaluated domain was relatively shallow, we conjecture that the developed system is readily adoptable as a CA NLIDB tool in other more semantically-rich domains and it shows promise in single or multi-domain environments.

Moreover, data processed by CSSs can be exposed to different actors, both internal and external to the organization. This contribution presents a methodology, called EPIC, that is specifically designed to evaluate privacy violation risks in cybersecurity systems. Differently, from other general purpose guidelines, EPIC is an operational methodology aimed at guiding security and privacy experts with step-by-step instructions from modeling data exposure in the CSS to the systematical identification of privacy threats and evaluation of their associated privacy violation risk.

In orthopedic surgical patients, it is very important to individually evaluate the risk/benefit of maintaining or suppressing chronic medications. For certain medications, there are consensus recommendations, but for others, the available information may be limited or controversial. Objective: To develop and validate a new guide for the continuity of care in perioperative medication management in older orthopedic surgical patients. Materials and methods: An expert pharmacist developed the guide by systematically reviewing each medication category according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee at the Hospital General Universitario de Elche reviewed the guide. After a training course on the guide for pharmacists, the guide was validated by studying the interobserver variability between pharmacists as well as between each pharmacist and the expert pharmacist. Cohen's kappa index (kappa) was applied to determine interrater reliability. Results: The guide includes 51 therapeutic groups. Each ATC pharmacological subgroup is structured according to the benefits and risks of continuing therapy. When we compared each pharmacist's recommendations with those of the expert pharmacist, the kappa value was found to be 0.8 [95% CI (0.7, 0.9)], indicating almost perfect concordance (overall percentage agreement 89.3%). Conclusions: We developed a guide for the continuity of care in perioperative medication management to improve the rationalization of medicines in the perioperative environment. After the pharmacists had been trained, the guide was validated by demonstrating a high level of concordance among the pharmacists' recommendations.

Additionally, advisees depend on persuasion, which drives them to follow the advisor's recommendations. However, advisors can be insufficiently equipped to persuade, resulting in advisees who are incapable of action or are unmotivated. Persuasive technology (PT) research proves that technology can motivate and enable people in single-user scenarios but pays limited attention to the natural realm of persuasion: the face-to-face conversation. This paper explores how persuasive technology transforms advice giving, a collaborative scenario involving an expert and a layperson. In such scenarios, IT does not act as a persuader but can provide affordances for persuasive practices, i.e., suggest new practices or enhance existing ones for convincing the advisee without deception or enforcement. We investigate the advisory practices in 24 real burglary prevention service encounters supported by IT. The paper shows the persuasive practices emerging through appropriation of the system, the tensions that govern the adoption or transformation of specific practices and routines and it confirms that studying the use and appropriation of technology uncovers organizational conflicts and tensions affecting such fundamental aspects as the advisor's role and job description.;"[Dolata, Mateusz; Schwabe, Gerhard] Univ Zurich, Dept Informat, Zurich, Switzerland";Dolata, M (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Informat, Zurich, Switzerland.;"dolata@ifi.uzh.ch; schwabe@ifi.uzh.ch";;;;;;80;2;2;1;19;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0925-9724;1573-7551;;COMPUT SUPP COOP W J;Comput.

Typically these elements are clustered and then the clusters organized hierarchically to reduce the number of elements to be simultaneously handled. These decomposition methodologies are intended to bring the problem within the cognitive ability of decision makers. However, such methodologies have disadvantages, and it may happen that such a priori clustering is not clear, and/or the problem has previously been addressed without any grouping action. This is the situation for the case study we address, in which a panel of experts gives opinions about the operation of 15 previously established district metered areas in a real water distribution system. Large pairwise comparison matrices may also be found when building comparisons of elements using large bodies of information. In this paper, we address a consistent compression of an AHP comparison matrix that collapses the judgments corresponding to a given number of compared elements. As a result, an a posteriori clustering of various elements becomes possible. In our case study, such a clustering offers several added benefits, including the identification of hidden or unknown criteria to cluster the considered elements of the problem.

The dualistic relationship between ecosystem and human beings require considering ecological and social systems as well as economic factors known as the three-legged approach. Individuals and their perceptions are also important in this approach because of the need of environmental awareness and behaviors. From this point of view, this study assesses the perceptions of local mine workers in the Goksu Valley about the environmental sustainability to understand the relationship between environmental, personal and organizational factors. Extroversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness as the sub-dimensions of the personality have positive correlations with environmental sustainability. Also, working conditions and expert power of the leader have a significant relationship with environmental sustainability within the mine worker sample which has a high-level environmental sustainability mean. The perceptions of local workers or residents are important to gain specific information about areas which have a special ecosystem for agriculture and animals.;[Ince, F.] Mersin Univ, Business Informat Management, Mersin, Turkey;Ince, F (corresponding author), Mersin Univ, Business Informat Management, Mersin, Turkey.;fatma_ince@yahoo.com;ince, Fatma/B-1292-2018;ince, Fatma/0000-0002-0628-5858;;;;32;0;0;0;66;IRAN SOLID WASTE ASSOC;TEHRAN;UNIV TEHRAN, PO BOX 1417853111, TEHRAN, 19166, IRAN;2383-3572;;;GLOB J ENVIRON SCI M;Glob.

J;Rubin, EL;;;;Rubin, Edward L.;;;STATUTORY DESIGN AS POLICY ANALYSIS;HARVARD JOURNAL ON LEGISLATION;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"MULTIDIMENSIONAL VOTING MODELS; FOREIGN-AFFAIRS; ADMINISTRATIVE STATE; LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; UNITED-STATES; POWER; CONSTITUTION; LESSONS; ACT";"Statutes dominate our legal system, but we have no theory about the best way to design them. The process that the U.S. Congress follows is haphazard and obscure. Any member can introduce a bill. There are no requirements about who can draft the bill or how the basic decisions that it embodies should be made. The one requirement is that the bill must be written in statutory language, in a form that appears ready for enactment. This means that all the basic decisions about the bill's design have been reached by the time the bill is introduced, and before it is subjected to any scrutiny by elected representatives or the general public. Any changes that the members of Congress want to make, if the bill goes forward, must be done through the revision process and on an incremental basis. This Article suggests a more systematic way to design legislation. Based on modern policy analysis, it proposes that the legislative process begin with a statement of a problem to he solved. Congressional committees would begin by analyzing the problem and generating a range of potential solutions. Drafts of proposed statutory language would only he considered at that point. A process of this sort is more likely to generate legislation that serves its basic purpose, which is to produce the results that the members who vote on it desire. Either House of Congress, or any individual chamber of a state legislature, could implement this approach without the approval of any other body, and without any significant change in its other practices or basic structure. The proposal, moreover, is nonpartisan, since members of either party will want to achieve their own purposes more effectively and reliably. This Article proposes that Congress and American state legislatures adopt a new method for designing statutes. At present, the process almost always begins with a written draft that is, a document phrased in statutory language that could be adopted as it stands. This Article's proposal, derived from the modern theory of policy analysis, is that legislatures begin with a statement of the problem that is being addressed. This statement, and not a draft of a proposed statute, would he the subject of the first set of hearings held by the relevant legislative committee or committees. Only after these hearings had been held, and a range of alternative statutory solutions presented to the committee, would the committee consider any document written in statutory language. The underlying issue that this proposal addresses is the quality of statutory enactments-that is, their ability to achieve their desired purpose. There can be no question about the importance of the issue. As Guido Calabresi has observed, we live in the age of statutes. (1) Statutes are the most important component of our modern legal system; for at least a century, they have determined the basic content of our law. Common law, or judge-made law, continues to govern some areas of private relations, and the President can exercise limited domestic authority through executive order. In the domestic area, however, the law by which we govern ourselves and attempt to shape our future is statutory.(2) But we have no theory, and a very limited academic discourse, about the best way to design statutes.(3) Worse still, even suggesting that this topic should be the subject of academic discussion violates a norm of modern scholarship. It is considered pointless or incoherent to address recommendations to legislatures about ways to improve their procedures.(4) Legal scholars regularly frame recommendations to courts about the best way to decide cases in general, in addition to the best answer to particular issues.(5) Policy analysts and political scientists offer recommendations to executive agents regarding their general decisionmaking strategy, as well as their resolution of specific problems. But few scholars,in these disciplines or any other, address similarly normative arguments to legislatures, the primary statute-making institution in the American system of governance,7 about the way to structure the legislative process so that it produces effective statutes. The legislative process has been extensively studied of course, but the great bulk of the work tends to be descriptive. With the exception of two recent articles that draw salutary attention to the drafting process and serve as the starting point for the present Article, one by Victoria Nourse and Jane Schacter and the other by Abbe Gluck and Lisa Bressman,(8) legal and political science scholarship devotes little attention to the actual language of statutes, as opposed to the politics of their enactment.(9) There are, to he sure, a relatively small number of books and articles that provide advice or instruction about the way to draft statutory language.(1) A notable feature of this limited literature is that it is addressed to a hypothesized drafting expert a policy analyst who is envisioned as drafting a statute that will subsequently be submitted to a legislature and not to the legislature itself(11) In fact, as David Marcello observes, the underlying assumption of this work is that the drafter is an abstract entity, a value-neutral technician who simply translates her client's instructions into statutory language.(12) A somewhat larger body of scholarly literature addresses expert organizations, most notably the American Law Institute (ALI) and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL), that draft uniform statutes for submission to state legislatures.(13) Because this literature is addressed to an expert body, however, it pays virtually no attention to the state legislatures that must ultimately enact the statutes that the ALI and NCCUSL design. Finally, there are some articles that propose a new statute or the improvement of an existing one.(14) Although these would appear to he addressed to legislators, they often seem to be general policy recommendations cast in statutory terms for the sake of concreteness or precision. An obvious explanation for this academic norm, and for the lacuna that it inevitably produces, is that scholars regard legislators as motivated by exclusively political considerations, specifically the desire to be reelected.(15) To be sure, empirical studies of actual legislators often conclude that they are motivated by ideology, which can be regarded as their idea about what is best for the nation.(16) But the scholars who conduct these studies do not act on this conclusion that is, they do not proceed to address legislators as rational decisionmakers and recommend ideas that would make their work product more effective.(17) What makes this omission even more remarkable is that scholars, as just noted, do not adopt this same approach to other government officials. That is not because they are so naive as to assert that judges and executive agents are selfless servants of the public who are never motivated by individual selfinterest.(18) The premise of normative scholarship, rather, is that public officials act from a mixture of personal and public-regarding motivations. Thus, the working assumption is that these officials will be receptive to recommendations about the best way to serve the public, and their decision-making will benefit from such recommendations, even if their motivations are mixed, or if they sometimes consider only their own personal advantage. Why then are scholars unwilling to take the same, seemingly reasonable approach to legislators, particularly when empirical evidence supports that approach? The issue becomes more urgent when one considers the had repute from which our national legislature currently suffers.(19) To some extent, this is irremediable; a legislature is, by design, an arena of political conflict, and people generally find conflict distressing.(20) But at least part of the overwhelming public dissatisfaction regarding Congress seems to stem from the sense that it is disorganized and chaotic, that it is unable to manage conflict in a systematic way and produce desirable results.(21) The tendency to treat the members of Congress as immune to rational discourse probably contributes to this popular belief. While the average citizen is not reading legal and political science literature, this liter ature does affect the general public discourse, and perhaps even the legislators' views about their own institution.(22) Certainly, a complete absence of scholarly discussion about ways that Congress can function more effectively can only exacerbate the general view that it cannot function at all. I have written previously about the possible reasons for this scholarly lacuna;23 the purpose of this Article is to counteract it by proposing a new methodology for the design of legislation. Part I describes the existing methodology, as employed by the U.S. Congress, and identifies the underlying premise of the methodology, which is that legislative drafting is a process of political argument. Part II suggests that a different methodology could be derived from the idea that legislation in the modern state is in fact a form of public policymaking. In Part III, the existing methodology is critiqued from a policymaking perspective. Part IV then proposes a new methodology for drafting legislation on the basis of the policymaking model described in Part II and the problem with the existing methodology described in Part III. Finally, Part V discusses the range of legislation to which the proposal would apply, and argues that there would be no serious impediments to its implementation.";[Rubin, Edward L.] Vanderbilt Univ, Law & Polit Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA;Rubin, EL (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Law & Polit Sci, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.;;;;;;;246;4;4;0;94;HARVARD LAW SCHOOL;CAMBRIDGE;PUBLICATIONS CTR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA;0017-808X;1943-507X;;HARVARD J LEGIS;Harv.

It illustrates the diverse types of evidence that may (or may not) be available to judges and juries when faced with the task of determining whether a person was relevantly intoxicated.'' It shows that in the absence of legislative guidance on how the task should be approached, courts tend to assign only a relatively marginal role to medical and scientific expert evidence, and frame the question as one that can be answered by applying common knowledge about the effects of alcohol and other drugs. The article examines the adequacy of this approach, given the weak foundation for assuming that the relationship between intoxication and the complex cognitive processes on which tribunals of fact are often required to reach conclusions (such as intent formation) is within the lay knowledge held by jurors and judges.;"[Quilter, Julia] Univ Wollongong, Sch Law, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Quilter, Julia] Univ Wollongong, Legal Intersect Res Ctr, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [McNamara, Luke] Univ New South Wales, Fac Law, Kensington, NSW, Australia; [McNamara, Luke] Univ New South Wales, Ctr Crime Law & Justice, Kensington, NSW, Australia";"Quilter, J (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Sch Law, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.; Quilter, J (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Legal Intersect Res Ctr, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.";;;;;;;32;5;5;0;16;UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS;OAKLAND;155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA;1933-4192;1933-4206;;NEW CRIM LAW REV;New Crim.

Given these findings, the global trend of the individualization of HRM practices, which did not preclude the specific population of experts', could be antagonistic to the development of collective forms of expertise. Drawing on a case study in a large science-based company, we analyze the impact of individualized managerial practices, and in particular the dual ladder, on expert work. We show that neglecting the collective dimension of expertise could endanger critical organizational processes, such as knowledge sharing, learning, innovating, decision making and problem solving.

There is considerable concern that SDG3.4 may not be achieved. The WHO Best Buys for NCDs has emphasized prevention, and although crucial, it alone will not achieve the 30% reduction in NCDs by 2030. Likewise, a strengthened health system is required as all NCDs are likely to require hospital facilities and community services for optimal management. This is a major problem for low-resource countries (LRCs) that is, low-income countries and lower-middle-income countriesas most currently have a poorly developed health system, including cancer services, in need of upgrading. This is a result of the extreme poverty of LRCs, where 40% to 80% of the population live on less than USD $1.25 per day, with the average health spending by governments in low-income countries at $110 per person per year. In this article, we outline a comprehensive national cancer services plan for LRCs. Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for cancer treatment also require input from other specialties, such as anesthesia, pathology, laboratory medicine, a blood bank, and diagnostic radiology. This will provide a focus for adding additional specialties, including cardiology, respiratory medicine, and psychiatry, to support the management of all NCDs and to contribute to the overall strengthening of the health system. The national cancer services plan for LRCs will require significant funding and input from both in-country and overseas experts in health, cancer, and finance working collaboratively. Success will depend on thoughtful strategic planning and providing the right balance of overseas support and guidance, but ensuring that there is in-country ownership and control of the program is essential.;"[Morgan, Graeme W.; Foster, Kirsty; Vu Huynh] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Opie, Craig] Royal North Shore Hosp, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Healy, Brendan] Icon Canc Grp, Brisbane, Qld, Australia";Morgan, GW (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Fac Med & Hlth, Sch Med, Off Global Hlth, Room 206,Edward Ford Bldg A27, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.;gmorgan1@bigpond.net.au;;Foster, Kirsty/0000-0002-2020-3791;;;;47;3;3;0;3;AMER SOC CLINICAL ONCOLOGY;ALEXANDRIA;2318 MILL ROAD, STE 800, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314 USA;2378-9506;;;J GLOB ONCOL;J.

The difference between a stock's potentially high value and its actual IPO price is referred as money-left-on-the-table, which has been extensively studied in the literature of corporate finance on its theoretical foundations, but surprisingly under-investigated in the field of computational decision support systems. Specifically, we use GARSINFIS to derive interpretable rules in determining whether there is money-left-on-the-table in IPOs to assist the investors in their decision making. For performance evaluations, we first demonstrate how to balance between accuracy and interpretability in GARSINFIS by simply altering the values of several coefficient parameters using well-known datasets. We then use GARSINFIS to investigate the IPO underpricing problem. The encouraging experimental results show that we may yield higher initial returns of IPOs by following the advices provided by GARSINFIS than any other benchmarking model. Therefore, our autonomous computational model is shown to be capable of offering the investors highly interpretable and reliable decision supports to grab the money-left-on-the-table in IPOs.

There are certain enablers for TPM implementation which helps the organization to implement it successfully. It is very essential to identify the nature and impact of these key enablers. Design/methodology/approach A large number of the enablers (27) have identified for TPM implementation in Indian SMEs from the available literature, questionnaire survey and expert opinion. These TPM enablers have categorized into six major categories. Findings In this research work, the intensity of identifying enablers has been calculated to show their impact or influence in TPM implementation. The value of intensity of TPM enablers shows the role or impact of individual enabler in the implementation of TPM in Indian SMEs. Practical implications This study provides an easy-to-use methodology for the practical decision makers in the manufacturing industry to improve their performance by implementing TPM in Indian SMEs. A detailed methodology has prepared to identify the enablers for TPM implementation in Indian SMEs by using GTA. This study also explains that how to check the feasibility of an organization to implement TPM in Indian SMEs successfully. Originality/value TPM is an improvement concept which holds the potential to improve manufacturing organizations, but its implementation is not easy in Indian SMEs. The reason behind the unsuccessful implementation of TPM in most of the organizations is the ignorance of impact of innumerable enablers and barriers.;"[Jain, Abhishek] Amity Univ Jaipur, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India; [Singh, Harwinder] Guru Nanak Dev Engn Coll, Ludhiana, Punjab, India; [Bhatti, Rajbir S.] Mt Royal Univ, Calgary, AB, Canada";Jain, A (corresponding author), Amity Univ Jaipur, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.;abhi_mpct@rediffmail.com;Bhatti, Rajbir/AAB-9637-2021;;University Grants Commission (UGC), New DelhiUniversity Grants Commission, India [F.30-1/2014/RA-2014-16-GE-PUN-5159 (SA-II)];The authors are grateful to the Editor-in-chief and the respected referees for their valuable comments and suggestions that led to a substantial improvement of the original manuscript.

This paper proposes to use the fuzzy failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) approach for assessing the risks associated with GSC for benchmarking the performance in terms of effective GSC management adoption and sustainable production. Design/methodology/approach Initially, different failure modes are defined using FMEA analysis, and in order to decide the risk priority, the risk priority number (RPN) is determined. Such priority numbers are typically acquired from the judgment decisions of experts that could contain the element of vagueness and imperfection due to human biases, and it may lead to inaccuracy in the process of risk assessment in GSC. In this study, fuzzy logic is applied to conventional FMEA to overcome the issues in assigning RPNs. A plastic manufacturer GSC case exemplar of the proposed model is illustrated to present the authenticity of this method of risk assessment. Findings Results indicate that the failure modes, given as improper green operating procedure, i.e. process, operations, etc. (R6), and green issues while closing the loop of GSC (R14) hold the highest RPN and FRPN scores in classical as well as fuzzy FMEA analysis. Originality/value The present research work attempts to propose an evaluation framework for risk assessment in GSC. This paper explores both sustainable developments and risks related to efficient management of GSC initiatives in a plastic industry supply chain context.

However, they are facing failures or less success in implementation, mainly due to lack of understanding in relating the lean practices (LPs) from the required performance measures perspective. In view of the lack of research and the importance of understanding them, the purpose of this paper is to prioritize LPs. Design/methodology/approach As LPs are scattered in the literature and a variety of performance measures are used, an extensive literature review is first carried out to identify the LPs and performance measures. The blend of interpretive structural modeling and interpretive ranking process interpretive tools is adopted in establishing the contextual relationship among LPs and then ranking them based on the performance measures. A three-dimensional priority matrix is proposed for better explanation of the results. Findings The proposed framework can help firms better understand LPs and their levels of importance in lean implementation. Research limitations/implications The involvement of lean experts may produce some bias in evaluating the LPs. Practical implications The proposed framework can help practitioners to develop an industry-specific road-map for the result-oriented LP implementation. Based on the area of performance to be improved, practitioners can prioritize LPs for implementation.

A total of 11 PIs have been identified through the literature review and the opinions of an expert team consisting of managerial and technical experts from dairy industry and academics. Design/methodology/approach A solution methodology based on the interpretive structure modeling (ISM) technique is used to analyze the interactions among PIs and to propose a structural model. The developed model not only helps in understanding the contextual relationship among the PIs, but also in determining their interdependence to assess the supply chain performance in dairy industry. Further, the importance of PIs has been determined based on their driving and dependence power by using MICMAC analysis. Findings The ISM-based model suggests four PIs at first level, three PIs at second level, one PI at third level as well as one PI at fourth level and two PIs at fifth level. Model allocates to the effective information technology, brand management, responsiveness in shipment and accuracy and a control over wastages as the key PIs in the dairy industry sector. The effective traceability systems, cold chain infrastructure, quality management and the support for technological innovations are the next major PIs. There exists no autonomous PI in MICMAC analysis which proves the importance of identified PIs in the case study. Research limitations/implications The proposed model is an attempt to capture the dynamics of milk processing sector and to incorporate all relevant constraints related to internal and external environments that would significantly improve the supply chain performance in the dairy industry. Practical implications The model developed in this study has been tested in the cooperative milk processing units based in India and also discussed with the experts from academics. This work may help practitioners, regulators and dairy industry professionals to focus their efforts toward achieving high performance by the effective implementation of the identified PIs. Originality/value In this study, 11 PIs are considered. Interactions among PIs are evaluated with the help of the ISM matrix. Out of the 11 PIs, six demonstrate both strong driving and dependence power as explained in the MICMAC analysis.;"[Mor, Rahul S.] Natl Inst Food Technol Entrepreneurship & Managem, Dept Food Engn, Sonepat, India; [Bhardwaj, Arvind] Dr BR Ambedkar Natl Inst Technol, Jalandhar, India; [Singh, Sarbjit] Dr BR Ambedkar Natl Inst Technol, Dept Ind & Prod Engn, Jalandhar, India";Mor, RS (corresponding author), Natl Inst Food Technol Entrepreneurship & Managem, Dept Food Engn, Sonepat, India.;dr.rahulmor@gmail.com;"Mor, Rahul S/A-7000-2015; Bhardwaj, Arvind/R-9358-2019; Singh, Sarbjit/AAF-3498-2019";"Mor, Rahul S/0000-0002-3481-5430; Singh, Sarbjit/0000-0002-6674-6951";;;;99;12;12;2;19;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;1463-5771;1758-4094;;BENCHMARKING;Benchmarking;NOV 29;2018;25;9;;;;;3858;3881;;10.1108/BIJ-09-2017-0254;;;24;Management;Business & Economics;HD4RY;WOS:000452516900024;;;;;2021-02-18;

Research and expert consensus support reducing high-dose opioid therapy, avoiding risky opioid-benzodiazepine combination therapy, and promoting multi-modal, collaborative models of pain care. Collaborative care interventions that support primary care providers have been effective in medication tapering. We developed a patient-centered Primary Care-Integrated Pain Support (PIPS) collaborative care clinical program based on effective components of previous collaborative care interventions. Implementation facilitation, a multi-faceted and dynamic strategy involving the provision of interactive problem-solving and support during implementation of a new program, is used to support key organizational staff throughout PIPS implementation. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation facilitation strategy for implementing and sustaining PIPS in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The secondary aim is to examine the effect of the program on key patient-level clinical outcomestransitioning to safer regimens and enhancing access to complementary and integrative health treatments. The tertiary aim is to determine the categorical costs and ultimate budget impact of PIPS implementation.MethodsThis multi-site study employs an interrupted time series, hybrid type III design to evaluate the effectiveness of implementation facilitation for a collaborative care clinical programPIPSin primary care clinics in three geographically diverse VHA health care systems (sites). Participants include pharmacists and allied staff involved in the delivery of clinical pain management services as well as patients. Eligible patients are prescribed either an outpatient opioid prescription greater than or equal to 90mg morphine equivalent daily dose or a combination opioid-benzodiazepine regimen. They must also have an upcoming appointment in primary care. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research will guide the mixed methods work across the formative evaluation phases and informs the selection of activities included in implementation facilitation. The RE-AIM framework will be used to assess Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance of PIPS.DiscussionThis implementation study will provide important insight into the effectiveness of implementation facilitation to enhance uptake of a collaborative care program in primary care, which targets unsafe opioid prescribing practices.;"[Midboe, Amanda M.; Troszak, Lara; Erhardt, Taryn] Stanford Univ, VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Ctr Innovat Implementat Ci2i, 795 Willow Rd 152 MPD, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Martino, Steve; Fenton, Brenda T.; Kerns, Robert D.; Becker, William C.] VA Connecticut Healthcare Syst, PRIME Ctr, West Haven, CT USA; [Martino, Steve; Fenton, Brenda T.; Kerns, Robert D.; Becker, William C.] Yale Sch Med, New Haven, CT USA; [Krein, Sarah L.] VA Ann Arbor, CCMR, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Krein, Sarah L.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Frank, Joseph W.; Schroeder, Allison] HSR&D Ctr Vet Ctr & Value Driven Care, VA Eastern Colorado Healthcare Syst, Denver, CO USA; [Frank, Joseph W.] Univ Colorado, Sch Med, Aurora, CO USA; [Painter, Jacob T.; Chandler, Michael] Cent Arkansas Vet Healthcare Syst, Ctr Mental Healthcare & Outcomes Res, North Little Rock, AR USA; [Painter, Jacob T.; Chandler, Michael] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Div Pharmaceut Evaluat & Policy, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA";Midboe, AM (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Ctr Innovat Implementat Ci2i, 795 Willow Rd 152 MPD, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.;Amanda.Midboe@va.gov;Krein, Sarah L/E-2742-2014;"Krein, Sarah L/0000-0003-2111-8131; /0000-0001-7191-2507";"Veterans Health Administration Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) [QUE 15-460]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863, UL1TR001863] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER";Funding for this study was provided by Veterans Health Administration Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) Grant QUE 15-460.

Design/methodology/approach The research employed a qualitative approach based on case studies to investigate in depth how companies perceive ISO 9001. More specifically, four enterprises were examined, and a total of 26 semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with top and middle managers from the companies. Questions were validated by experts and through pilot interviews. In total, 45 documents of a broad range related to the quality management system were examined. Personal observation and non-structured consultation with personnel were also used to evaluate the possible impacts and livelihood outcomes. Findings Research findings showed that the certified companies in the F&B industry gain a number of both internal and external benefits, including: quality awareness, increased productivity, increased personnel participation and efficiency, improved image and penetration into new markets. Regarding the financial benefits of certification, the findings are not as convincing, as one company reported no financial benefits, and the rest reported that financial benefits are indirect and intangible. Conclusively, it can be said that SMEs that wish to pursue certification should certainly expect benefits. Practical implications Although many studies have concentrated on analyzing the impact of the implementation of ISO 9001 certification, there is still a clear need for research in specific sectors. Practicing managers and researchers will be able to examine findings in order to evaluate benefits and weaknesses from certification, thereby identifying and acting before and after certification. Originality/value Although the F&B industry has shown a great preference for the ISO 9000 standard and has adopted it extensively, scant empirical evidence has been recorded on the subject. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the benefits for implementing the ISO 9001 certification and to the analysis of its application to the ever-important F&B industry in Greece, a country whose economy is particularly supported by SMEs and has been severely hit by the economic crisis. Researchers will therefore further their knowledge, understand benefits but also acknowledge weaknesses.;"[Kakouris, Andreas P.] Panepistemio Aigaiou, Mitilini, Greece; [Sfakianaki, Eleni] Hellen Open Univ, Sch Social Sci, Patras, Greece";Sfakianaki, E (corresponding author), Hellen Open Univ, Sch Social Sci, Patras, Greece.;esfakianaki@eap.gr;SFAKIANAKI, ELENI/S-7786-2016;;;;;134;4;4;1;22;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0265-671X;1758-6682;;INT J QUAL RELIAB MA;Int.

Objective: This study aimed to present a rapid evidence review process that can be used to inform health system leaders and clinicians seeking to implement new technology tools to improve patient-clinician decision making and patient-oriented outcomes. Methods: The rapid evidence review process we pioneered involved 5 sequential subprocesses: (1) environmental scan, (2) expert panel recruitment, (3) host evidence review panel, (4) analysis, and (5) local validation panel. We conducted an environmental scan of health information technology (IT) literature to identify relevant digital tools in oncology care. We synthesized the recent literature using current evidence review methods, creating visual summaries for use by a national panel of experts. Panelists were taken through a 6-hour modified Delphi process to prioritize tools for implementation. Findings from the rapid evidence review panel were taken to a local validation panel for further rapid review during a 3-hour session. Results: Our rapid evidence review process shows promise for informing decision making by reducing the amount of time and resources needed to identify and prioritize adoption of IT tools. Despite evidence of improved patient outcomes, panelists had substantial concerns about implementing patient-reported outcome tracking tools, voicing concerns about liability, lack of familiarity with new technology, and additional time and workflow changes such tools would require. Instead, clinicians favored technologies that did not require clinician involvement.

We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the HEP score compared with the 4Ts score in a prospective cohort of 310 patients with suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). A member of the clinical team calculated the HEP score and 4Ts score. An independent panel adjudicated HIT status based on a clinical summary as well as the results of HIT laboratory testing. The prevalence of HIT in the study population was 14.7%. At a cutoff of >= 3 the HEP score was 95.3% sensitive (95% confidence interval [CI], 84.2-99.4) and 35.7% specific (95% CI, 29.8-42.0) for HIT. A 4Ts score of >= 4 had a sensitivity of 97.7% (95% CI, 86.2-99.8) and specificity of 32.9% (95% CI, 27.2-39.1). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) for the HEP score and 4Ts score were similar (0.81 [95% CI, 0.74-0.87] vs 0.76 [95% CI, 0.69-0.83]; P = .12). The HEP score exhibited a significantly higher AUC than the 4Ts score in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) (0.86 vs 0.79; P = .03). Among trainee scorers, the HEP score performed significantly better than the 4Ts score (AUC, 0.80 vs 0.73; P = .03).

It is a challenging topic due to the high requirements for reliable data acquisition and efficient data analysis. Besides, the heterogeneous layouts of smart homes, the number of residents and varied human behavioral patterns also aggravate the complexity of recognition. Therefore, most human activity recognition systems are based on an unrealistic assumption that there is only one resident performing activities. In this paper, we investigate the issue of multi-resident activity recognition and propose a knowledge-driven solution on the basis of formal concept analysis (FCA) to identify human activities from non-intrusive sensor data. We extract the ontological correlations among sequential behavioral patterns. At the same time, these correlations are well organized in a graphical knowledge base, without intervention from domain experts. We propose an incremental lattice search strategy in order to retrieve the best inference given a few sensor events. Compared with other conventional probabilistic methods, our solution outperforms on the CASAS multi-resident benchmark dataset. Furthermore, we open up a promising solution of sequential pattern mining to discover the ontological features of temporal and sequential sensor data. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Because supermarkets are growing in number and in the variety of system types and characteristics, information about common faults and equipment is essential prior to investing effort on the development of new fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) methods or other improvements to system design and operation. A study was conducted to investigate supermarket equipment characteristics, such as the prevalence of central vs. distributed systems, condenser types, control strategies, and common operating faults such as refrigerant leakage, failed evaporator or condenser fans, failed compressors, etc. The data come from four sources: expert surveys, facility management system messages, service calls, and service records. Some of the results of the study are that centralized direct expansion systems with on/off compressor capacity control strategy and air-cooled condensers are the most common system types and refrigerant charge problems are the most common source of equipment failure. Case-related problems, in aggregate, are the most frequently occurring faults in supermarkets.;"[Behfar, Alireza; Yuill, David; Yu, Yuebin] Univ Nebraska, Charles W Durham Sch Architectural Engn & Constru, 1110 S 67th St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA";Behfar, A (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Charles W Durham Sch Architectural Engn & Constru, 1110 S 67th St, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.;abehfar@unomaba.edu;;;"ASHRAE 1615 RP - TC 7.5 Smart Building Systems; TC 10.7 Commercial Food and Beverage Refrigeration Equipment; ASHRAE";The research work was supported by ASHRAE 1615 RP, sponsored by TC 7.5 Smart Building Systems, and TC 10.7 Commercial Food and Beverage Refrigeration Equipment.

Despite rapidly increasing knowledge about the genetic origins, specific features and potential treatments for the known CMS entities, the lack of standardized classification at the most granular level has hindered the implementation of computer-based systems for knowledge capture and reuse. Where individual clinical or genetic entities do not exist in disease coding systems, they are often invisible in clinical records and inadequately annotated in information systems, and features that apply to one disease but not another cannot be adequately differentiated.ResultsWe created a detailed classification of all CMS disease entities suitable for use in clinical and genetic databases and decision support systems. To avoid conflict with existing coding systems as well as with expert-defined group-level classifications, we developed a collaboration with the Orphanet nomenclature for rare diseases, creating a clinically understandable name for each entity and placing it within a logical hierarchy that paves the way towards computer-aided clinical systems and improved knowledge bases for CMS that can adequately differentiate between types and ascribe relevant expert knowledge to each.ConclusionsWe suggest that data science approaches can be used effectively in the clinical domain in a way that does not disrupt preexisting expert classification and that enhances the utility of existing coding systems. Our classification provides a comprehensive view of the individual CMS entities in a manner that supports differential diagnosis and understanding of the range and heterogeneity of the disease but that also enables robust computational coding and hierarchy for machine-readability. It can be extended as required in the light of future scientific advances, but already provides the starting point for the creation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) knowledge bases of data on the congenital myasthenic syndromes.;"[Thompson, Rachel] Newcastle Univ, Inst Med Genet, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Abicht, Angela] Med Genet Ctr, Munich, Germany; [Beeson, David] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Clin Neurosci, Oxford OX3 9DU, England; [Engel, Andrew G.] Mayo Clin, Dept Neurol, Rochester, MN USA; [Eymard, Bruno] Inst Myol, Paris, France; [Maxime, Emmanuel] INSERM US14 Orphanet, Plateforme Malad Rares, F-75014 Paris, France; [Lochmueller, Hanns] Univ Ottawa, Childrens Hosp Eastern Ontario CHEO Res Inst, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L1, Canada; [Lochmueller, Hanns] Univ Freiburg, Fac Med, Med Ctr, Dept Neuropediat & Muscle Disorders, Freiburg, Germany; [Lochmueller, Hanns] Barcelona Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Nacl Analisis Genom CNAG CRG, Ctr Genom Regulat, Barcelona, Spain";Thompson, R (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Inst Med Genet, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.;rae.thompson@gmail.com;;;"European Union, FP7European Union (EU) [30544]; UK Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases [G1002274, 98482]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [NS109491]; European Union, Horizon 2020 [779257]";RT and HL received funding from the European Union, FP7 Grant No. 30544: RD-Connect and Horizon 2020 Grant No. 779257: Solve-RD, and the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases (G1002274, grant ID 98482).

While this can seem overwhelming, it is possible to take practical steps toward EAFM implementation that make use of existing information and provide managers with valuable strategic advice. Here, we describe the process used by the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) to develop an ecosystem-level risk assessment, the initial step proposed in their recently adopted EAFM guidance document. The Council first defined five types of Risk Elements (ecological, economic, social, food production, management) and identified which management objectives aligned with each element. Based on an existing ecosystem status report for the region and other existing sources (including expert opinion), potential ecological, social, economic, and management indicators were identified for each risk element. Finally, low, low-moderate, moderate-high, and high risk criteria were defined for each indicator, and the indicator data were used to score each risk element using the criteria. The ultimate outcome is a ranked risk assessment in order to focus on the highest risk issues for further evaluation and mitigation. The risk assessment highlights certain species and certain management issues as posing higher cumulative risks to meeting Council management objectives when considering a broad range of ecological, social, and economic factors. Tabular color coded summaries of risk assessment results will be used by the Council to prioritize further EAFM analyses as well as research plans over the coming 5 years. As ecosystem reporting and operational EAFM continue to evolve in future years, the Council foresees integrating these efforts so that ecosystem indicators are refined to meet the needs of fishery managers in identifying and managing risks to achieving ecological, social, and economic fishery objectives. Overall, ecosystem indicator-based risk assessment is a method that can be adapted to a wide range of resource management systems and available information, and therefore represents a promising way forward in the implementation of EAFM.;"[Gaichas, Sarah K.; DePiper, Geret S.] NMFS, NOAA, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Seagraves, Richard J.; Muffley, Brandon W.; Sabo, Mary G.] Midatlantic Fishery Management Council, Dover, DE USA; [Colburn, Lisa L.] NMFS, NOAA, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Narragansset, RI USA";Gaichas, SK (corresponding author), NMFS, NOAA, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.;sarah.gaichas@noaa.gov;;;"Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council; US Federal Government (Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) - Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council";This work was prepared by employees of the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council and the US Federal Government (Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) as part of their official duties.

Limited case studies have demonstrated the potential of BNs in modeling multiple data streams for eruption forecasting and volcanic hazard assessment. Nevertheless, BNs are not widely employed in volcano observatories. Motivated by their need to determine eruption-related fieldwork risks, we have worked closely with the New Zealand volcano monitoring team to appraise BNs for eruption forecasting with the purpose, at this stage, of assessing the utility of the concept rather than develop a full operational framework. We adapted a previously published BN for a pilot study to forecast volcanic eruption on Whakaari/White Island. Developing the model structure provided a useful framework for the members of the volcano monitoring team to share their knowledge and interpretation of the volcanic system. We aimed to capture the conceptual understanding of the volcanic processes and represent all observables that are regularly monitored. The pilot model has a total of 30 variables, four of them describing the volcanic processes that can lead to three different types of eruptions: phreatic, magmatic explosive and magmatic effusive. The remaining 23 variables are grouped into observations related to seismicity, fluid geochemistry and surface manifestations. To estimate the model parameters, we held a workshop with 11 experts, including two from outside the monitoring team. To reduce the number of conditional probabilities that the experts needed to estimate, each variable is described by only two states. However, experts were concerned about this limitation, in particular for continuous data. Therefore, they were reluctant to define thresholds to distinguish between states. We conclude that volcano monitoring requires BN modeling techniques that can accommodate continuous variables. More work is required to link unobservable (latent) processes with observables and with eruptive patterns, and to model dynamic processes. A provisional application of the pilot model revealed several key insights. Refining the BN modeling techniques will help advance understanding of volcanoes and improve capabilities for forecasting volcanic eruptions. We consider that BNs will become essential for handling ever-burgeoning observations, and for assessing data's evidential meaning for operational eruption forecasting.;"[Christophersen, Annemarie; Deligne, Natalia, I] GNS Sci, Lower Hutt, New Zealand; [Hanea, Anca M.] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Excellence Biosecur Risk Anal, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Chardot, Lauriane] Nanyang Technol Univ, Earth Observ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Fournier, Nicolas] GNS Sci, Wairakei Res Ctr, Wairakei, New Zealand; [Aspinall, Willy P.] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Aspinall, Willy P.] Univ Bristol, Cabot Inst, Bristol, Avon, England; [Aspinall, Willy P.] Aspinall & Associates, Tisbury, England";Christophersen, A (corresponding author), GNS Sci, Lower Hutt, New Zealand.;a.christophersen@gns.cri.nz;"Aspinall, Willy/AAW-1022-2020; Hanea, Anca/AAI-5294-2020; Chardot, Lauriane/O-6253-2019";"Aspinall, Willy/0000-0001-6014-6042; Hanea, Anca/0000-0003-3870-5949; Christophersen, Annemarie/0000-0003-1467-1414; Deligne, Natalia/0000-0001-9221-8581";"GNS Science Strategic Science Research; GNS Science Core Research Programme";The pilot project was supported by GNS Science Strategic Science Research funding and by GNS Science Core Research Programme funding.;;83;8;8;0;2;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;2296-6463;;FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ;Front.

Hence,EMS is a critical component of the health systems and is necessary to improve outcomes of injuries and other time-sensitive illnesses. Still there exists a substantial need for evidence to improve our understanding of the capacity of such systems as well as their strengths, weaknesses, and priority areas for improvement in low-resource environments. The aim was to develop a tool for assessment of the pre-hospital EMS system using the World Health Organization (WHO) health system framework. Relevant literature search and expert consultation helped identify variables describing system capacity, outputs, and goals of pre-hospital EMS. Those were organized according to the health systems framework, and a multipronged approach is proposed for data collection including use of qualitative and quantitative methods with triangulation of information from important stakeholders, direct observation, and policy document review. The resultant information is expected to provide a holistic picture of the pre-hospital emergency medical services and develop key recommendations for PEMS systems strengthening.;"[Mehmood, Amber; Rowther, Armaan Ahmed; Hyder, Adnan A.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Hlth Syst Program,Johns Hopkins Int Injury Res Un, 615 N Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Kobusingye, Olive] Makerere Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Kampala, Uganda";Mehmood, A (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Hlth Syst Program,Johns Hopkins Int Injury Res Un, 615 N Wolfe St, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.;amehmoo2@jhu.edu;Mehmood, Amber/U-5303-2019;"Rowther, Armaan/0000-0002-2490-0076; Mehmood, Amber/0000-0002-8417-1282";Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health through the CGH Faculty Pilot Grant award;We thank the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health for funding this research through the CGH Faculty Pilot Grant award.

However, the topic of reducing the programming effort required by an expert using natural modes of communication is still open. To answer this challenge, we propose an approach based on Interactive Reinforcement Learning that learns a complete collaborative assembly process. The learning approach is done in two steps. First step consists of modeling simple tasks that compose the assembly process, using task based formalism. The robotic system then uses these modeled simple tasks and proposes to the user a set of possible actions at each step of the assembly process via a GUI. The user then interacts with the robotic system by selecting an option from the given choice. The robot records the action chosen and performs it, progressing the assembly process. Thereby, the user teaches the system which task to perform when. In order to reduce the number of actions proposed, the system considers additional information such as user and robot capabilities and object affordances. These set of action proposals are further reduced by modeling the proposed actions into a goal based hierarchy and by including action prerequisites. The learning framework highlights its ability to learn a complicated human robot collaborative assembly process in a user intuitive fashion. The framework also allows different users to teach different assembly processes to the robot.;"[Akkaladevi, Sharath Chandra; Plasch, Matthias; Maddukuri, Sriniwas; Eitzinger, Christian; Pichler, Andreas] Profactor GmbH, Steyr Gleink, Steyr, Austria; [Akkaladevi, Sharath Chandra; Rinner, Bernhard] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Inst Networked & Embedded Syst, Klagenfurt, Austria";"Akkaladevi, SC (corresponding author), Profactor GmbH, Steyr Gleink, Steyr, Austria.; Akkaladevi, SC (corresponding author), Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Inst Networked & Embedded Syst, Klagenfurt, Austria.";sharath.akkaladevi@profactor.at;;;"project LERN4MRK (Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology); project MMAssist_II (FFG) [858623]; DigiManu (State of Upper Austria); Smart Factory Lab";This research is funded by the projects LERN4MRK (Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology), MMAssist_II (FFG, 858623), Smart Factory Lab and DigiManu (funded by the State of Upper Austria).;;41;2;2;2;7;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;2296-9144;;;FRONT ROBOT AI;Front.

Its relationship with sensory systems has already been explored, however, the role it plays in olfactory processing in the cerebellum is unclear. Several hypotheses have been proposed from work done in humans and animal models with neuroimaging and immunohistochemical techniques. Everything seems to indicate that the cerebellar function is of vital importance for the olfactory perception, being able to be controlling not only the olfactory aspect, but also the olfactory processing. In this study we analyzed the multiunit activity in the granular layer of the cerebellar vermis during olfactory stimulation: a session being sexually naive and during four sessions of sexual behavior learning. The amplitude was compared between male naive and sexual experts, as well as between olfactory stimuli. The amplitude of the sexually experienced rats showed the highest values compared to naive ones. Odor of receptive female causes the greatest amplitudes, however, in the control group the amplitude increased when they were sexually experts. The motor, sensory and associative learning generated by the acquisition of sexual experience modifies the activation pattern in the cerebellum by presenting neutral odors or associated with a reward.;"[Tamariz Rodriguez, Amiel; Vasquez-Celaya, Lizbeth] Univ Veracruzana, Invest Cerebrales, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; [Coria-Avila, Genaro A.; Perez, Cesar A.; Aranda-Abreu, Gonzalo E.; Manzo, Jorge; Garcia, Luis I.] Univ Veracruzana, Ctr Invest Cerebrales, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; [Carrillo, Porfirio] Univ Veracruzana, Inst Neuroetol, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico";Garcia, LI (corresponding author), Univ Veracruzana, Ctr Invest Cerebrales, Unidad Bosque, Med S-N, Xalapa 91010, Veracruz, Mexico.;luisgarcia@uv.mx;"Denes, Jorge Manzo/W-2750-2019; Coria-Avila, Genaro/K-1421-2017";"Coria-Avila, Genaro/0000-0003-1663-836X; Aranda-Abreu, Gonzalo/0000-0001-8519-5473";"PROMEP-Mexico [PTC-195];  [CONACyT294146]";The study was carried out as part of doctoral thesis of ATR (CONACyT294146 scholarship) and had partial support from PROMEP-MexicoPTC-195.

Whereas it is crucial to have data such as the actual number of undiagnosed patients, to help inform the implementation plan with such programs, there have been no systematic studies to quantitate the numbers of patients principally because of the inherent difficulty in most health systems to identify patients whose condition has not yet been diagnosed and coded. Our national experience with a rare disease program, Nan-Byo which was established in 1972, and the more recently expanded Initiative on Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases (IRUD), provided a unique opportunity to design a cross-sectional study to ascertain the undiagnosed patients in Japan based on the IRUD referral criteria. Results: Two rounds of online surveys were performed: one survey targeting physicians affiliated with general hospitals (GH) and family clinics (FC) (the response rate: 30.6% (242/792)) and one nationwide survey targeting university hospitals (UH) in Japan (47.1% (839/1781)). A high percentage of doctors needing IRUD was seen in pediatrics at GH, FC, while there was a clear demand for IRUD in most departments at UH. We calculated the number of undiagnosed patients in Japan, as the percentage of doctors needing IRUD x number of patients who would be referred to IRUD per doctor needing IRUD (cases/person) x total number of doctors in the relevant facilities in Japan (persons), resulting in 3681 cases in pediatrics/pediatric surgery and 33,703 cases in other departments, for a total of 37,384 cases. Conclusions: Our study revealed the extant demand for IRUD in most departments and 37,000+ potential patients with undiagnosed diseases in the Japanese health system. These data inform the establishment of an equitable, sustainable, efficient and effective outpatient-based IRUD. These findings would serve as a valuable reference for undiagnosed diseases programs in different international jurisdictions and for countries and regions who also share vision(s) for societal implementation that help to advance international efforts to support patients with rare diseases who are direly waiting for diagnosis, subsequent treatment and care.;"[Adachi, Takeya; Imanishi, Noriaki; Ogawa, Yasushi; Furusawa, Yoshihiko; Izumida, Yoshihiko; Izumi, Yoko; Suematsu, Makoto] Japan Agcy Med Res & Dev AMED, Chiyoda Ku, 22F Yomiuri Shimbun Bldg,1-7-1 Otemachi, Tokyo 1000004, Japan";Adachi, T (corresponding author), Japan Agcy Med Res & Dev AMED, Chiyoda Ku, 22F Yomiuri Shimbun Bldg,1-7-1 Otemachi, Tokyo 1000004, Japan.;"jpn4156@me.com; irud@amed.go.jp";"ADACHI, Takeya/C-4996-2018; Suematsu, Makoto/I-8135-2013; Suematsu, Makoto/O-5762-2018";"ADACHI, Takeya/0000-0002-5289-5980; Suematsu, Makoto/0000-0002-7165-6336; Suematsu, Makoto/0000-0002-7165-6336; Ogawa, Yasushi/0000-0003-3553-9607";;;;23;2;2;1;5;BMC;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND;1750-1172;;;ORPHANET J RARE DIS;Orphanet J.

The continuous interpretation schemes described in the literature, however, do not all use the same underlying probabilistic model and standards outlining which probabilistic models may or may not be implemented into casework do not exist; thus, it is the individual forensic laboratory or expert that decides which model and corresponding software program to implement. For countries, such as the United States, with an adversarial legal system, one can envision a scenario where two probabilistic models are used to present the weight of evidence, and two LRs are presented by two experts. Conversely, if no independent review of the evidence is requested, one expert using one model may present one LR as there is no standard or guideline requiring the uncertainty in the LR estimate be presented. The choice of model determines the underlying probability calculation, and changes to it can result in non-negligible differences in the reported LR or corresponding verbal categorization presented to the trier-of-fact. In this paper, we study the impact of model differences on the LR and on the corresponding verbal expression computed using four variants of a continuous mixture interpretation method. The four models were tested five times each on 101, 1-, 2- and 3-person experimental samples with known contributors. For each sample, LRs were computed using the known contributor as the person of interest. In all four models, intra-model variability increased with an increase in the number of contributors and with a decrease in the contributor's template mass. Inter-model variability in the associated verbal expression of the LR was observed in 32 of the 195 LRs used for comparison. Moreover, in 11 of these profiles there was a change from LR > 1 to LR < 1. These results indicate that modifications to existing continuous models do have the potential to significantly impact the final statistic, justifying the continuation of broad-based, large-scale, independent studies to quantify the limits of reliability and variability of existing forensically relevant systems.";"[Swaminathan, Harish] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Qureshi, Muhammad O.; Lun, Desmond S.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Camden, NJ 08102 USA; [Grgicak, Catherine M.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem, Camden, NJ USA; [Grgicak, Catherine M.; Lun, Desmond S.] Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Computat & Integrat Biol, Camden, NJ 08102 USA; [Duffy, Ken] Maynooth Univ, Hamilton Inst, Kildare, Ireland; [Lun, Desmond S.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA";"Lun, DS (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Camden, NJ 08102 USA.; Lun, DS (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Ctr Computat & Integrat Biol, Camden, NJ 08102 USA.; Lun, DS (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.";dslun@rutgers.edu;Duffy, Ken R/D-7955-2011;Duffy, Ken R/0000-0001-5587-9356;National Institute of Justice [2014-DN-BX-K026, 2014-DN-BX-0001];This study was funded by the National Institute of Justice, grant numbers 2014-DN-BX-K026 to CMG and 2014-DN-BX-0001 to HS.

This is because in this case, the decision-maker must distinguish between image features that are clinically diagnostic (i.e., signal) from a large amount of non-diagnostic features. (i.e., noise). To perform this task, the decision-maker must have learned the underlying statistical distributions of the signal and noise to begin with. The same is true for machine learning algorithms that perform a given diagnostic task. In order to train and test human experts or expert machine systems in any diagnostic or analytical task, it is advisable to use large sets of images, so as to capture the underlying statistical distributions adequately. Large numbers of images are also useful in clinical and scientific research about the underlying diagnostic process, which remains poorly understood. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to obtain medical images of given specific descriptions in sufficiently large numbers. This represents a significant barrier to progress in the arenas of clinical care, education, and research. Here we describe a novel methodology that helps overcome this barrier. This method leverages the burgeoning technologies of deep learning (DL) and deep synthesis (DS) to synthesize medical images de novo. We provide a proof-of-principle of this approach using mammograms as an illustrative case. During the initial, prerequisite DL phase of the study, we trained a publicly available deep learning neural network (DNN), using open-sourced, radiologically vetted mammograms as labeled examples. During the subsequent DS phase of the study, the fully trained DNN was made to synthesize, de novo, images that capture the image statistics of a given input image. The resulting images indicated that our DNN was able to faithfully capture the image statistics of visually diverse sets of mammograms. We also briefly outline rigorous psychophysical testing methods to measure the extent to which synthesized mammography were sufficiently alike their original counterparts to human experts. These tests reveal that mammography experts fail to distinguish synthesized mammograms from their original counterparts at a statistically significant level, suggesting that the synthesized images were sufficiently realistic. Taken together, these results demonstrate that deep synthesis has the potential to be impactful in all fields in which medical images play a key role, most notably in radiology and pathology.;"[Bart, Evgeniy] Palo Alto Res Ctr, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Hegde, Jay] Augusta Univ, Dept Neurosci & Regenerat Med, James & Jean Culver Vis Discovery Inst, Grad Sch, Augusta, GA 30904 USA; [Hegde, Jay] Augusta Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, Med Coll Georgia, Augusta, GA 30904 USA";"Hegde, J (corresponding author), Augusta Univ, Dept Neurosci & Regenerat Med, James & Jean Culver Vis Discovery Inst, Grad Sch, Augusta, GA 30904 USA.; Hegde, J (corresponding author), Augusta Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, Med Coll Georgia, Augusta, GA 30904 USA.";jay@hegde.us;;;United States Army Research Office (ARO) [W911NF-11-1-0105, W911NF-15-1-0311];This study was supported by United States Army Research Office (ARO) grants #W911NF-11-1-0105 and W911NF-15-1-0311 to JH.;;53;1;1;0;3;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;1662-5196;;FRONT NEUROINFORM;Front.

Auto-segmentation of their images is a key to effective on-line monitoring system. Therefore, an unsupervised segmentation algorithm is required. The purpose of this paper is to present a novel approach based on a local color-texture feature. An algorithm is specially designed for segmentation of wear particles' thin section images. Design/methodology/approach The wear particles were generated by three kinds of tribo-tests. Pin-on-disk test and pin-on-plate test were done to generate sliding wear particles, including severe sliding ones; four-ball test was done to generate fatigue particles. Then an algorithm base on local texture property is raised, it includes two steps, first, color quantization reduces the total quantity of the colors without missing too much of the detail; second, edge image is calculated and by using a region grow technique, the image can be divided into different regions. Parameters are tested, and a criterion is designed to judge the performances. Findings Parameters have been tested; the scale chosen has significant influence on edge image calculation and seeds generation. Different size of windows should be applied to varies particles. Compared with traditional thresholding method along with edge detector, the proposed algorithm showed promising result. It offers a relatively higher accuracy and can be used on color image instead of gray image with little computing complexity. A conclusion can be drawn that the present method is suited for wear particles' image segmentation and can be put into practical use in wear particles' identification system. Research limitations/implications One major problem is when small particles with similar texture are attached, the algorithm will not take them as two but as one big particle. The other problem is when dealing with thin particles, mainly abrasive particles, the algorithm usually takes it as a single line instead of an area. These problems might be solved by introducing a smaller scale of 9 x 9 window or by making use of some edge enhance technique. In this way, the subtle edges between small particles or thin particles might be detected. But the effectiveness of a scale this small shall be tested. One can also magnify the original picture to double or even triple its size, but it will dramatically increase the calculating time. Originality/value A new unsupervised segmentation algorithm is proposed. Using the property of the edge image, we can get target out of its background, automatically. A rather complete research is done. The method is not only introduced but also completely tested. The authors examined parameters and found the best set of parameters for different kinds of wear particles. To ensure that the proposed method can work on images under different condition, three kinds of tribology tests have been carried out to simulate different wears.

This type of research uses multiple disciplines and methods and emphasises partnerships between community members, implementers, researchers, and policy makers. Implementation research focuses on practical approaches to improve implementation and to enhance equity, efficiency, scale-up, and sustainability, and ultimately to improve people's health. There is growing interest in the principles of implementation research and a range of perspectives on its purposes and appropriate methods. However, limited efforts have been made to systematically document and review learning from the practice of implementation research across different countries and technical areas. Drawing on an expert review process, this Health Policy paper presents purposively selected case studies to illustrate the essential characteristics of implementation research and its application in low-income and middle-income countries. The case studies are organised into four categories related to the purposes of using implementation research, including improving people's health, informing policy design and implementation, strengthening health service delivery, and empowering communities and beneficiaries. Each of the case studies addresses implementation problems, involves partnerships to co-create solutions, uses tacit knowledge and research, and is based on a shared commitment towards improving health outcomes. The case studies reveal the complex adaptive nature of health systems, emphasise the importance of understanding context, and highlight the role of multidisciplinary, rigorous, and adaptive processes that allow for course correction to ensure interventions have an impact. This Health Policy paper is part of a call to action to increase the use of implementation research in global health, build the field of implementation research inclusive of research utilisation efforts, and accelerate efforts to bridge the gap between research, policy, and practice to improve health outcomes.;"[Theobald, Sally; Raven, Joanna] Univ Liverpool Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Int Publ Hlth, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England; [Brandes, Neal] US Agcy Int Dev, Bur Global Hlth, Washington, DC 20523 USA; [Gyapong, Margaret] Univ Hlth & Allied Sci, Ho, Ghana; [El-Saharty, Sameh] World Bank, Human Dev Sect, Middle East & North Africa Reg, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Proctor, Enola] Washington Univ, Brown Sch Social Work, St Louis, MO USA; [Diaz, Theresa] WHO, Dept Maternal Newborn Child & Adolescent Hlth, Geneva, Switzerland; [Wanji, Samuel] Univ Buea, Dept Microbiol & Parasitol, Buea, Cameroon; [Elloker, Soraya] City Cape Town, City Hlth Dept, Cape Town, South Africa; [Elsey, Helen] Univ Leeds, Nuffield Ctr Int Hlth & Dev, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Bharal, Sushil] HERD Int, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Pelletier, David] Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Programme Int Nutr, Ithaca, NY USA; [Peters, David H.] Johns Hopkins Univ Bloomberg, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA";Theobald, S (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Dept Int Publ Hlth, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England.;sally.theobald@lstmed.ac.uk;Elsey, Helen/AAZ-1121-2020;"Elsey, Helen/0000-0003-4724-0581; Raven, Joanna/0000-0002-4112-6959; Theobald, Sally/0000-0002-9053-211X; Gyapong, Margaret/0000-0002-4818-3497";"Funding Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research; World BankThe World Bank India; USAID, through the Health Research Challenge for Impact ProjectUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID); Translating Research into Action project [GHS-A-00-09-00015-00]; University Research Corporation;  [GHS-A-00-09-00004-00]";Funding was obtained from the Funding Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, the World Bank, and USAID, through the Health Research Challenge for Impact Project with a Leader with Associates Cooperative Agreement (GHS-A-00-09-00004-00) to John Hopkins University, and the Translating Research into Action project funded under cooperative agreement (GHS-A-00-09-00015-00) with University Research Corporation.

To mitigate risk and enhance safety awareness in maritime transportation, safety researchers have been seeking proactive solutions. This article prompts a quantitative risk-based approach combining interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) with failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) to perform a comprehensive risk analysis. Thus, potential failure modes and their effects are revealed by calculating risk prioritisation numbers (RPNs). Whilst the FMEA method provides a robust risk analysing tool with relevant control options, the IT2FSs deals with ambiguity and vagueness of linguistic assessment of decision-makers through the FMEA. Hence, expert's linguistic assessment in risk assessment can be transformed into useful information in terms of enhancing safety and pollution prevention in maritime industry. To demonstrate the proposed approach, potential failures and effects of a real shipboard oil spill case are handled. The findings show that incomplete information exchanged with local maritime authorities, malfunction of oil skimmer and poor organization of shoreline clean-up team are the most important failures during case of oil spill. The proposed approach provides not only theoretical insight into the maritime transportation industry but also practical contributions to chemical/oil tanker safety and environmental protection by mitigating risk in terms of technical or operational aspects.;"[Akyuz, Emre] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Maritime Transportat & Management Engn, TR-34940 Istanbul, Turkey; [Celik, Erkan] Munzur Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tunceli, Turkey";Akyuz, E (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Maritime Transportat & Management Engn, TR-34940 Istanbul, Turkey.;emreakyuz82@gmail.com;"Akyuz, Emre/ABB-1245-2020; Celik, Erkan/O-1075-2013; Akyuz, Emre/L-9543-2018";"Akyuz, Emre/0000-0002-0071-9619; Celik, Erkan/0000-0003-4465-0913; Akyuz, Emre/0000-0002-0071-9619";;;;60;16;16;4;38;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0308-8839;1464-5254;;MARIT POLICY MANAG;Marit.

The incidence of back disorders is greater in women than men, and for similar work demands females are functioning closer to their physiological limit. It is crucial to study loading on the spine musculoskeletal system with actual handlers, including females, to better understand the risk of back disorders. Extrapolation from biomechanical studies conducted on unexperienced subjects (mainly males) might not be applicable to actual female workers. For male workers, expertise changes the lumbar spine flexion, passive spine resistance, and active/passive muscle forces. However, experienced females select similar postures to those of novices when spine loading is critical. This study proposes that the techniques adopted by male experts, male novices, and females (with considerable experience but not categorized as experts) impact their lumbar spine musculoskeletal systems differently. Spinal loads, muscle forces, and passive resistance (muscle and ligamentous spine) were predicted by a multi-joint EMG-assisted optimization musculoskeletal model of the lumbar spine. Expert males flexed their lumbar spine less (avg. 21.9 degrees vs 30.3-31.7 degrees) and showed decreased passive internal moments (muscle avg. 8.9% vs 15.9-16.0%; spine avg. 4.7% vs 7.1-7.8%) and increased active internal moments (avg. 72.9% vs 62.0-63.9%), thus producing a different impact on their lumbar spine musculoskeletal systems. Experienced females sustained the highest relative spine loads (compression avg. 7.3 N/BW vs 6.2-6.4 N/BW; shear avg. 2.3 N/BW vs 1.7-1.8 N/BW) in addition to passive muscle and ligamentous spine resistance similar to novices. Combined with smaller body size, less strength, and the sequential lifting technique used by females, this could potentially mean greater risk of back injury. Workers should be trained early to limit excessive and repetitive stretching of their lumbar spine passive tissues. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

An automatic construction method was used that considered explanation adequacy and inference accuracy. In addition, we evaluated the usefulness of prior experts ('radiologists') knowledge while constructing the models. In total, 179 patients with lung nodules were included and divided into 79 and 100 cases for training and test data, respectively. F-measure and accuracy were used to assess explanation adequacy and inference accuracy, respectively. For F-measure, reasons were defined as proper subsets of Evidence that had a strong influence on the inference result. The inference models were automatically constructed using the Bayesian network and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, selecting only those models that met the predefined criteria. During model constructions, we examined the effect of including radiologist's knowledge in the initial Bayesian network models. Performance of the best models in terms of F-measure, accuracy, and evaluation metric were as follows: 0.411, 72.0%, and 0.566, respectively, with prior knowledge, and 0.274, 65.0%, and 0.462, respectively, without prior knowledge. The best models with prior knowledge were then subjectively and independently evaluated by two radiologists using a 5-point scale, with 5, 3, and 1 representing beneficial, appropriate, and detrimental, respectively. The average scores by the two radiologists were 3.97 and 3.76 for the test data, indicating that the proposed computer-aided diagnosis system was acceptable to them. In conclusion, the proposed method incorporating radiologist's knowledge could help in eliminating radiologist's distrust of computer-aided diagnosis and improving its performance.;"[Kawagishi, Masami; Aoyama, Gakuto; Iizuka, Yoshio; Yamamoto, Hiroyuki] Canon Inc, Ohta Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Kubo, Takeshi; Sakamoto, Ryo; Yakami, Masahiro; Sekiguchi, Hiroyuki; Nishio, Mizuho; Togashi, Kaori] Kyoto Univ, Dept Diagnost Imaging & Nucl Med, Grad Sch Med, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan; [Sakamoto, Ryo; Yakami, Masahiro; Nishio, Mizuho] Kyoto Univ Hosp, Preempt Med & Lifestyle Related Dis Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan; [Fujimoto, Koji] Kyoto Univ, Human Brain Res Ctr, Grad Sch Med, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan; [Emoto, Yutaka] Kyoto Coll Med Sci, Dept Med Sci, Sonobe Cho, Kyoto, Japan; [Sakai, Koji] Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Radiol, Kamigyo Ku, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan";"Nishio, M (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Diagnost Imaging & Nucl Med, Grad Sch Med, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan.; Nishio, M (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ Hosp, Preempt Med & Lifestyle Related Dis Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan.";nmizuho@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp;;;"Innovative Techno-Hub for Integrated Medical Bioimaging of the Project for Developing Innovation Systems; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16K19883]; Canon Inc.";This work was partly supported by the Innovative Techno-Hub for Integrated Medical Bioimaging of the Project for Developing Innovation Systems, from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan and by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number JP16K19883).

The risk of falls in older adults increases because of the decrease in strength, flexibility, balance and sensory changes affecting functionality and quality of life. For this reason, an integral system of evaluation of equilibrium is necessary, for preventive purposes or for early therapeutic interventions. Aim. To present the results of the transcultural translation and adaptation process of the Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) to Spanish language. Subjects and methods. The original version of the BESTest was translated into Spanish, following the process of retrotraduction and cultural adaptation considering the semantic, idiomatic, conceptual and experiential equivalences. Subsequently the version was reviewed by a panel of experts qualifying clarity, coherence, relevance and sufficiency. The pilot test included 32 adults between 50 and 80 years old. Results. It was possible to carry out the complete translation of the instrument, the instructions for the subject and for the evaluator. Most items of the test reached the maximum score of 4.0 (100%), nine items achieved an average score of 3.9 (99%), one item got an average score of 3.8 (95%) and two items achieved an average score of 3.7 (92.5%).

Despite the Choquet integral being a very well-known preference model for which there is a rich and well developed theory, its application in a multiple criteria decision aiding perspective requires some specific methodological developments. This led us to work out and implement in practice two new procedures: a first procedure to build interval scales with the objective of assigning utility values on a common scale to the criteria performances, and a second one to construct a ratio scale for assigning numerical values to the capacities of the Choquet integral. This article discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the Choquet integral as appearing in the case study, proposing as well insights related to the interaction of the experts within a focus group.

Later on, this phenomenon was also observed in several Latin-American countries. In February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) on this basis, declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. From that moment on, several measures were adopted to achieve the epidemic control at both international and national levels. The WHO launched a strategic response plan based on case detection, infection control and treatment, as well as, the research and development of new vector control tools, diagnostic tests and vaccines. In Europe both surveillance and vector control systems were reinforced. The countries reporting most cases were France, Spain and the United Kingdom. In Spain, due to the high probability of case importation based on the close relationships with Latin-America, numerous measures were adopted to achieve a rapid response and an optimal control. Those included: the implementation of an active surveillance in collaboration with several experts, institutions and scientific societies; entomologic surveillance enhancement; the development of communication activities and recommendations for both healthcare workers and general population.";"[Redondo Bravo, Lidia] Hosp Univ La Paz, Serv Med Prevent, Madrid, Spain; [Suarez Rodriguez, Berta; Simon Soria, Fernando; Sierra Moros, Maria Jose] Minist Sanidad Consumo & Bienestar Social, Ctr Coordinac Alertas & Emergencias Sanitarias, Madrid, Spain; [Fernandez Martinez, Beatriz; Diaz Garcia, Oliva] Inst Salud Carlos III, Ctr Nacl Epidemiol, Madrid, Spain; [Fernandez Martinez, Beatriz] CIBER Epidemiol & Salud Publ CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain";Moros, MJS (corresponding author), Minist Sanidad Serv Sociales & Igualdad, Ctr Coordinac Alertas & Emergencias Sanitarias, Direcc Gen Salud Publ Calidad & Innovac, Paseo Prado 18-20, Madrid, Spain.;jsierra@mscbs.es;;;;;;57;1;1;1;2;MINISTERIO DE SANIDAD Y CONSUMO;MADRID;PASEO DEL PRADO 18-20, MADRID, 28071, SPAIN;1135-5727;;;REV ESP SALUD PUBLIC;Rev.

This method performs the diagnosis procedure automatically, and it is more suitable for specialists in better understanding and assessment of the disease. Our approach shows potential in confronting hesitancy through considering experts' uncertainty in modeling. In this study, we propose an automatic computer-aided diagnosis system based on iFCMs to determine the grade of celiac disease. By relying on the knowledge of experts, the key features of disease are extracted as the main concepts, and the iFCM model for the complex grading system is designed as a graph with eight concepts. The results obtained by applying our proposed method (iFCM-AHL) on the dataset verify the ability and effectiveness of this model. The proposed iFCM by considering hesitation of experts in modeling process and property of less sensitive to missing input data, not only increase accuracy in detecting the type of disease, but also obtain a higher robustness, in dealing with incomplete data. The obtained results have been compared with the findings of the FCM, interval type-2 fuzzy logic system, untrained iFCM and five extensions of the FCM. Comparative results show that our approach offers a robust classification method that produces better performance than other models. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, due to different types of variable area nozzle, performance prediction is mainly focused on costly numerical simulations. In this paper, one-dimensional models for performance prediction of variable area gas ejector with specially designed nozzle, were compared. Additionally, operational lines and corresponding modes were analyzed. Two different variable area ejectors were experimentally tested. The first ejector used natural gas as motive fluid, whereas in the second one motive gas was the composition of alkane. Six distinct correlations of ejector component efficiencies were evaluated. Sum of absolute relative errors and coefficient of determination were used as goodness of fit criteria. The results showed that best model has coefficient of determination 0.76 and 0.63 in the case of natural and R2 gas as motive fluids, respectively. In order to improve prediction performances of entrainment ratio, the mixture of experts machine learning technique was used. Moreover, the results of obtained conditional probabilities of models are visualized in space spanned by area and pressure ratios. The presented analysis showed that one model is not generally better than others and can be improved by using an ensemble of models.
